		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, funnily enough I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyfOduzia4A" target="_blank">answered this question for another person with a video a while back</a> </p>
<p>If you dont want to watch the video I'll run over the points here too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are more in touch with reality as we grow older. The economy, and our limited time on this planet distract us. We need to make sure we can provide for our family and friends, we study and work to make sure we can live a comfortable life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social norms also take away from us, we understand we have a role in the world and as adults we believe we shouldn't be seen being &quot;childish&quot; and having a very active imagination can be seen as this. I personally dont agree with how people see this as childish at all, I think it's a great character to have. It's different depending on culture though, as we are brought up in a certain way to see adults as responsible, serious hard working individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We care about what other people think, children do not. There have been studies to show that they dont care, they dont see the world the same as us. Kids are a bundle of joy (most of the time!), as we grow older we are much more worried about how people see us. This may be down to the fact that we are hardwired to find a partner and have children. If we dont act in an attractive way, then we may not find a mate. It's pretty blunt to say, but at the end of the day we are animals and our top priorities are survival and breeding.</p>
</li>
<li>We are much more busy as adults, as I stated before we are constantly working and our lives get swallowed by work. The majority of people don't live in the now. They live constantly thinking of the future, not paying attention to the here and now. Children are different, they live for the now. They try and enjoy themselves as much as possible. Playing and imagining cool scenarios are examples of this. For example, if a child was sat in a car they'd look out the window and see a blank canvas. They'd imagine a character running along side the car doing all sorts of cool stunts (that's what I used to do). However, an adult may not think like this, they'd think about people, work, debt, schedules etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helped, and I hope you enjoyed the joke at the end of the video. I usually answer peoples questions through this subreddit in the form of a video and I've been doing it for a year now. My drawing has got slightly better, along with my animation skills. This video is pretty old, but it targeted your question so I thought I'd try and help you out!</p>
<p>Have a great day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You simply stopped doing it. Not everyone does and those that continue it are still able to do this. They tend to use said skill to write books, write video games, make movies, make tv shows. And in the non-professional realm they write fanfic, picture books as they read them, play table top games, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fact we still have that skill, we just don't use it anymore because as we grow older, we adapt to the reality and accept it as it is.  As adults we have responsibilities and pressures such as making a living.  Most of the adults find daydreaming as silly and distracting.  But there are people who still do it as adults, they are writers, actors, movie directors, etc.  There are a minority of other adults who do it compulsively, and that condition is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive_daydreaming" target="_blank">Maladaptive daydreaming</a>.  Most people are unaware of this, including mental health professionals.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would propose that you simply get smarter.  The same idea might pop into your head &quot;man wouldn't it be cool if a dragon had machine guns mounted on it?&quot;  But then the logical part of your brain would step up telling you how angry a dragon would be, how relatively useless machine guns would be attached to it, etc.</p>
<p>If you asked a child &quot;why does the dragon let you ride it&quot; the child might say &quot;We are friends&quot; but you would ask yourself &quot;well why are we friends, how could we possibly have met and developed a friendship.&quot;  If you want to go around riding on a dragon doing crazy adventures you basically have to come up with the entire Game of Thrones world in order to satisfy the questions you would have.</p>
<p>That kind of thing takes a tremendous mental effort and commitment of time.  You have to justify to yourself spending that time on it.  </p>
<p>However, when those answers are given to you, you will absolutely lose yourself in fantasy for hours at a time: look at video games, movies, or books.  Those things really are just guided imaginings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
