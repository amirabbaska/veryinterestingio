		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lens focuses light on an image sensor chip, which is what actually converts the light to an electronic signal.  The chip is rectangular, and just covers a fraction of the focused image created by the lens.</p>
<p>The image created by the lens -- the focused light -- doesn't have very abrupt edges.  Far from the middle, the quality and intensity drop off.  The sensor is positioned well within the good part.</p>
<p>So why are the sensors rectangular?  Partly it's just tradition, but it's also that many are made on a big silicon wafer and then cut apart, into rectangles.  If the sensors were round, there would be wasted space in the corners of each square sensor chip.</p>
<p>Edit: I've added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtr5d8j/" target="_blank">another comment with more details</a>, including a sort of table of contents for some of the comments below that I think provide particularly good clarifications or explore interesting further aspects.</p>
<p>My edit also rephrased the above explanation a little based on seeing what wrong impressions my original phrasing gave.  I'm deliberately leaving it short and oversimplified because the original seemed to capture the key points and because more detail is in the linked comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are some additional comments and links to key additional information people have provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could it work better if the image sensor plane was curved?  Certainly with a simple lens that would be true, but that's not very practical, and in fact lenses are specifically designed to produce a sharp image on a flat surface, which is a better way to address the issue, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq6dj3/" target="_blank">explained</a> by u/Radiatin.  And, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq4nxd/" target="_blank">explained</a> by u/marcan42, some cameras correct the distortion digitally.   u/burning1rr provides a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqq4s0/" target="_blank">helpful linked list</a> of types of aberrations in imaging to help sort out which types of issues are addressed by which approaches being dicussed.  The human eye <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq7ztw/" target="_blank">does use a curved sensor</a>,  as pointed out by u/mckulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue of how gradually vs. abruptly the image degrades at the periphery of the image is clarified by u/bravenone whose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq3x0r/" target="_blank">comment</a> also links to a great illustration.  The degree to which it drops off suddenly is affected by the lens design, as explained by u/dragoneye <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqb4y0/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Also, even better is this <a href="https://cdn.instructables.com/FCZ/0O0X/GMSXHDSU/FCZ0O0XGMSXHDSU.MEDIUM.jpg" target="_blank">better example picture</a> that u/jonmatifa's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtr659h/" target="_blank">comment</a> linked to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history and origins of the convention of rectangular film and even paintings are discussed by many including u/minionoftheminions and u/AyeBraine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq3vsv/" target="_blank">here</a>, by u/kevin034 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq4zam/" target="_blank">here</a> and by u/aranou <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtq86j8/" target="_blank">here</a>.  A few of these discussions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqjkux/" target="_blank">noted</a> that there were some film cameras that took with round  pictures (u/sometimes_interested was interested in that).  More discussion of that is in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtpxxc1/" target="_blank">this sub thread</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqp6cu/" target="_blank">reason Si wafers are round</a> is explained by u/a_wild_redditor.</p>
</li>
<li>Then there's the question of why aren't the lenses rectangular?  I explain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqjrpc/" target="_blank">here</a> that a rectangular lens could still work, but that leaves the question of why a circle is chosen, given that there are many options.  u/RespawnerSE <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqm2ao/" target="_blank">explains</a> that that's because of how lenses are made, as also explained by u/MattieShoes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqcfrk/" target="_blank">here</a>.  To make another shape lens, you'd likely be cutting down a circular lens.  More on that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7v6ayh/if_camera_lenses_are_circular_why_do_they_produce/dtqc3pt/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
