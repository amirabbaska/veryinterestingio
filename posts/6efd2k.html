		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons.</p>
<p>When you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals.</p>
<p>Now, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state.</p>
<p>When charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation.</p>
<p>tl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what we're hoping to be able to do with <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/phys.org/news/2016-07-fast-charging-everlasting-battery-power-graphene.amp" target="_blank">graphene batteries</a> </p>
<p>They are an example of a supercapacitor, a battery able to physically hold onto electrons. You'd be able to plug it in, fill it up and go on with your life in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>This is very different from our current technologies, all of which use an electrical current to reverse a chemical reaction. As everyone is saying this process necessarily takes a while and is fairly inefficient, hence battery chargers getting hot, heat production=wasted energy. This is essentially the same difference between lightbulb types. Incandescents are very inefficient, so they get very hot, CFLs are fairly efficient so they only get warm and LEDs are very efficient so they barely produce heat at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short - heat.  Cells (because the world is a collection of bodges) have chemistry that creates internal resistances, and that means heat is generated in charging much as passing current through any wire.</p>
<p>Fast chargers (usually rebadges of Qualcomm QuickCharge) negotiate upto 12v charging adjusting the current to reduce heat build up getting out of control.</p>
<p>What you want CAN however be done with supercapacitors - they're basically chemistry-free, and are constantly evolving.  Soon we'll likely be seeing them in cellphones, but they're not ready quite yet.  You can charge them to capacity very quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms without getting into battery chemistry:</p>
<p>Power (wattage) in a conductor is resistance times current squared.  So when current is flowing in or out of a battery, it is going to create waste heat based on it's internal resistance and the current flowing in or out of it squared.  This means the battery itself gets warmer when it's in use or charging.  And since it's current squared doubling the current quadruples the heat.  If you either charge or discharge too fast, it will overheat.  The result of overheating will depend on the type of battery.  Could make the pack fail quietly, or could make it burst into flames...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A battery is made of metal and rust. One of the metals wants to give away the glue that holds it together, so it can turn to rust. The rust wants to get some glue so it can become metal again. Instead of letting them make their trade normally, by putting both in a bath of basically saltwater, we put something in their way. Now, they have to push it through a pipe to exchange it. the power they spend pushing is used by your phone to play youtube and stuff. How hard they push is called voltage, or how badly they want to trade electrons. Your battery wants to be at 0.00V. If it goes below 2.90V, we won't be able to recharge it, because one metal will be a pile of rust and another will be overgrown from all the electrons the rust gave it. </p>
<p>At too high a voltage, the metals say &quot;lol, screw this&quot; and start doing stuff we don't want, like making hydrogen gas (explosive) or getting too hot. And we also can't recharge them after this. </p>
<p>If you try to charge too quickly, you make too much heat. The types of metals in batteries really like heat because it helps them rust quickly. All this heat lights your phone on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
