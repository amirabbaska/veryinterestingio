		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the fat isn't sloshing around, despite it being liquid - just like the ~60% that is water isn't  sloshing around. It isn't right to think of the components of an organism as discreet lumps that act like you'd expect the pure form to act out of the body, because the components are encapsulated in complex structures in the body.</p>
<p>In the body fat is stored in fat cells, called adipocytes. These cells are held in place in a complex web of connective tissue, with strong proteins like collagen supporting them. Inside the cells the fat is stored in tiny spheres called inclusions, which are in turn given structure by their own families of proteins, and they are held in the structural proteins of the cell as a whole.</p>
<p>Ultimately all this results in the fat being held pretty rigidly in place. It acts more like a gel.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry I missed addressing a flaw in the question. The fat in a duck is <em>always</em> a liquid, regardless of the outside temperature - because ducks maintain their temperature at ~100f. This is really important. If the fat becomes solid it isn't as easy/is nearly impossible to move around or use when the body needs it. If the fat is solid, it is safe to assume the duck is no longer. -also- the correct word for lipid droplets in cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animal fat is not just chunks of lipid lying around but connective tissue composed mostly of lipocytes, or fat cells. These specialized cells store the actual lipid molecules as small droplets. You could similarly ask why all the water in animals (70-80% of body weight) is not just sloshing around :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general most fats aren't solid inside a critter. If it's hard at 100 degrees Fahrenheit or so the body has trouble moving it and it builds up in places it shouldn't. Think about saturated vs unsaturated fats. The unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are healthier. The solid fat you'd see on a carcass is fat tissue that has a lot of storage areas inside those cells for liquid fat. Note that it gets a lot floppier at room temperature. You wouldn't want to be a wiggly critter if that stuff were hard at body temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
