If you drop an object, it will accelerate (due to gravity) to a point where it can no longer accelerate (due to resistances, such as air resistance), thus reaching its top speed through natural falling.</p>
<p>However, what if the object is initially thrown downwards faster than its expected terminal velocity?</p>
<p>Would the upwards resistances slow the object until it reduces the velocity to the object’s expected terminal velocity, or would it stay at it’s thrown velocity?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes, if an object is falling faster than its terminal velocity, then it will slow to its terminal velocity.
The terminal velocity occurs when the force of gravity exactly equals the upwards force of air resistance (the net force in this case is zero). The formula, then, for figuring out terminal velocity, is a simple matter of equating the force of gravity, mg, and the drag force, cv or cv^2 depending on the situation, to get
mg=cv -&gt; v=mg/c
(or in the case of cv^2, use v=sqrt(mg/c)  ).
m is mass and g is gravitational acceleration, whereas on the other side, v is the velocity of the object, and c is the &quot;drag coefficient&quot; of the object, which factors in a bunch of things like the objects mass, shape, volume, i.e. anything that will have an impact on its speed. Scientists just find this number for various objects by measuring the force exerted on an object by the air as it moves through that air in a wind tunnel. In some cases, scientists find that the drag force is proportional to v, in other cases it is closer to proportional to v^2.
say then that we have an object that has a drag coefficient C, terminal velocity |V|, and mass M. this means that
Mg=C|V|.
say that we threw said object at a downward velocity of 2|V|. this means that you doubled the upward drag force on the object, which is then now twice as big as the downward force of gravity
(2Mg= C(2|V|)  ). The greater upward force will slow the object down, initially with a net upwards force of mg in this case (replace Cv with C|V|, then replace C|V| with mg in the equation
F(net)=Cv-mg  )
As should be obvious now, the object will slow under this greater upwards force. as it slows, its upwards force decreases (remember,
F(drag)=Cv), eventually slowing to |V|, at which point
Mg=Cv
and the net force is zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try looking at a Falcon 9 launch where they recover the first stage. You'll see the first stage slowing down as it re-enters the atmosphere, even before they start the re-entry burn. The atmosphere is pretty good at slowing stuff down (the reason for the re-entry burn is that pure aerobraking would heat up the first stage too much).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity just means that the forces acting in all directions are constant. So yes, if you threw something downwards, say a feather, when your hand was in the process of throwing it the force of your hand has accelerated it past terminal velocity. As soon as you let go, the feather starts to decelerate (because it's a feather it does so almost instantly as it has hardly any momentum), the only force acting on it downwards is gravity, and air resistance is acting against it in the opposite direction. These forces are equal at terminal velocity, so it falls at a constant velocity, which is slower than its initial velocity during the throw. </p>
<p>TLDR: Yes</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The jumper falls at terminal velocity for a time, then opens his parachute; that increases both his drag coefficient and his drag area. Result: he now has a <em>different</em> terminal velocity, and decelerates to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
