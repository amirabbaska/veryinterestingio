		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geology PhD here, I will add citations and extra info if this comment gets interest, I'm just about to get on a plane so that'll be in several hours but a lot happened 3 Ma, during that period the Earth transitioned from a &quot;greenhouse&quot; earth to an &quot;ice house&quot; Earth as the Northern hemisphere glaciated. This was due to the closure of the Isthmus of Panama which altered ocean currents and allowed the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to form (it may have existed in a weakened state before however). This cooled the northern hemisphere allowing ice sheets to form. The ice sheets of Antarctica had already formed at this point however around 34 Ma. </p>
<p>In short the CO2 levels were higher due to a number of reasons but one was the planet was still in a warm &quot;phase&quot; with high levels of atmospheric CO2 because there was less area of ice sheet to store CO2 and cool the planet allowing more CO2 to be stored in the oceans</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is all I can remember off the top of my head, please correct me if any of it is wrong :-)</p>
<p>Edit: My flight is delayed! Good news for you all but bad news for me haha, anyway, promised citations from a presentation I did on the topic recently:</p>

<p>Edit 2: If you thought the Pleistocene had high CO2 then google the paleocene eocene thermal maximum, I'm happy to add info about that after my flight (once I can access my computer)</p>
<p>Edit 3: thanks for the gold! My first :-D boarding now (delay was minimal) I'll be back in a few hours with more cool palaeo stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If the dinosaurs thrived because of &quot;Greenhouse&quot; earth, due to the overly warm temperatures and the propagation of all the &quot;tropical&quot; flora, won't the current &quot;Greenhouse&quot; Earth just lead us back to the same?</p>
<p>Plant species that don't grow above a certain latitude will now grow in Canada? Stuff like that? I understand it would be a huge change for every single human on the planet but will it really be horrendous?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My question is, how long was the atmosphere at that level for it to appear in the ice core?  Was it at 410 ppm for a week (obviously not likely) or was it there for a year?  100 years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
