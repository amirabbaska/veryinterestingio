		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>fat wood which is used to start fires is based on the continued production of sap in roots when a tree has been cut down.   To make it pine trees are cut down leaving a stump a foot or so tall.  The roots continue to produce the sap that would have supplied the entire tree.  The sap becomes concentrated in the remaining stump.  The stump is then cut off the roots after sap production has stopped.   The harvested piece of stump is then split down into pieces just bigger than the thickness of a pencil.  These pieces can be lit easily with a match.  The sap acts as an accelerant.  Itâ€™s a great natural way to start wood stoves etc.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start out by saying trees have hormones. Auxin is produced in the leaves and travels down to the roots, sort of as a way of saying to the roots &quot;hey I'm here and I'm making sugar!&quot; The roots produce cytokinin, which travels up to the leaves and says &quot;hey I'm here and I'm getting water and micronutrients!&quot; </p>
<p>When a tree is cut, the auxin isn't being produced anymore, so the roots start to freak out. &quot;Where did the leaves go!! We need to produce sugar!!&quot; This is why sometimes you see what's called stump sprouting. Oaks, maples, sweetgum, etc will sometimes put little shoots up after being cut. This is the tree's attempt to come back alive to produce more sugar. </p>
<p>So yes, the tree is usually still alive and trying to produce more sugars. Unfortunately, any new leaves it puts out just isn't adequate for the root system of the previously much larger tree, and the roots eventually die. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's actually an intentional technique that harvests wood regrown from a stump, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppicing" target="_blank">Coppicing</a>.  Basically, as long as you don't keep re-cutting it too aggressively, many types of trees will just keep regrowing forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No tree strump would die instantly. Parts of the strump still above ground would continue to photosynthesize under the bark, and the roots would continue to grow, for a while at least. </p>
<p>But it really depends on the trees growth strategy as to wether they could live in the long term. Some trees have  buds at ground level and stored carbon for such kind of situation. These would quickly reshoot to form a new trunk/trunks. Trees that are coppiced have to have this ability. But some trees can't really resprout from that low, and they eventually die when their carbon stores run out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
