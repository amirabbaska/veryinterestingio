I get that sensitive toothpastes are different, but what about the rest? Do &quot;cavity protection&quot;, &quot;tartar control&quot;, etc. actually mean something different, it is it fundamentally the same thing in each case?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's not a lot of difference. Some manufacturers will add materials that have certain properties, but in real-life use, those properties will be minimal.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Whitening toothpaste contains a higher level of <del>surfactants</del> abrasives, essentially &quot;scrubbing&quot; the surface of the tooth clean. This can damage enamel over time. They may also contain bleaching agents.</p>
<p>&quot;Enamel repair&quot; toothpaste contains calcium-based substances that are reputed to replace the surface layer of enamel. They are essentially a stopgap, and the material that's deposited will be removed pretty swiftly. We cannot replace enamel manually, and the body doesn't produce any more over time.</p>
<p>Cavity protection will be through addition of sodium fluoride, which is proven to help with strengthening of the enamel. So that actually does work, but the vast majority of toothpastes have sodium fluoride in them anyway, so claiming &quot;cavity protection&quot; is redundant.</p>
<p>Put simply, just buy a cheap, fluoride-containing toothpaste, and use it. The physical action of brushing is far, far more important than the type of paste you use.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p><strong>Holy crap</strong>, inbox asplode. Thank you for gold, kind mystery redditor.</p>
<p>All of the above still applies, but I thought it might be useful to add in some information that others have stated below, or that I left out.</p>
<p>So, first off, things that <em>do</em> affect dental hygiene and effectiveness. First and foremost, since it's the single most important thing - brushing technique. The vast majority of people don't have great brushing technique with manual toothbrushes, so it's commonly recommended that everyone uses electric toothbrushes, which do the &quot;hard bit&quot; for you and provide the most comprehensive brushing possible. This technology is gradually evolving over time, but the rule of thumb is to go for one that has three key movements - rotation, in-out vibration, and oscillation. These three things have been proven to effectively clean the tooth surface, and stimulate the gum line, resulting in improved overall oral health.</p>
<p>/u/tcmaresh and /u/unsanitary_napkin made an excellent point - toothpastes that say &quot;9 out of 10 dentists recommend&quot; only say that because dentists recommend that people use toothpaste. That's it. They're not recommending a brand, they're recommending toothpaste in general. Additionally, in order to be approved by the dental association, they have to work, and not do any harm. Those are the only two requirements.</p>
<p>Next - flossing, and interdental brushes. The general consensus is that brushing <em>and</em> flossing is better than either one or the other, but there is a growing body of research that suggests flossing is not as effective as interdental brushes (again, when used in combination with normal brushing). Do some reading up on ID brushes, and give them a try if you want to. But if you're flossing regularly (or not) and your dentist has told you your teeth are in good shape, just stick with what you know.</p>
<p>Now, on to other toothpaste ingredients. As some have stated, brushing <em>without</em> toothpaste actually removes just as much bacteria, food particles and tartar from the surface of the tooth as brushing <em>with</em> toothpaste. However there are some ingredients that prolong the effectiveness of brushing, give fresher breath, assist with gum health, etc etc. So, some examples below.</p>
<p>&quot;Sensitive&quot; toothpastes. This includes Sensodyne. There are some ingredients, particularly Novamin, which do appear to significantly help with tooth sensitivity. These do not aid with overall oral health, but they <em>do</em> help with your teeth not feeling like they're being ripped in twain on a daily basis. Worth using if you suffer from this affliction.</p>
<p>Fluorides. Whilst sodium fluoride is the &quot;standard&quot; substance for fluoride delivery to the enamel, as various people have stated, there are others. These include stannous fluoride, one that's still used in certain brands. All of them have the same mode of action, which is to deliver fluoride to the surface of the tooth. Some make it more &quot;available&quot; than others, but the difference appears to be fairly minimal. Stannous fluoride can give some people problems, including tissue sloughing (bits of skin coming off the inside of your mouth), gum whitening, and tooth staining. Ultimately though it doesn't really matter what type you use, as long as you use it. Note that all OTC main brand toothpastes will typically contain the same amount of fluoride. Prescription toothpastes are different, and contain more.</p>
<p>Antiseptic agents - this includes Chlorhexidine and Triclosan. These remove bacteria from the mouth, and can assist with gum health and cavity prevention; they also hang around in the area, preventing bacteria from returning. Antiseptic agents can be beneficial, but some studies have suggested that we need to maintain the &quot;good&quot; bacteria in our mouths, which assist with prevention of halitosis and tartar buildup. So approach with caution, but they are generally good to use (this includes mouthwash).</p>
<p>Enamel repair. This has come up a lot. There are some substances which appear to promote remineralisation of enamel. However, having done some reading up of my own, this effect is minimal, and occurs over a long, long period of time. It may still be beneficial for some, but consuming acidic foods or drink will quickly reverse the process, so diet control is needed alongside use of these substances. As per my original response, just brush your teeth. If you want to include enamel repair toothpaste (at a significant price), feel free. But it's not essential.</p>
<p>Xylitol. This is a sugar substitute that is included in a lot of chewing gum, and some toothpastes. Its key benefit is that it cannot be digested by bacteria, so it offers an excellent sweetening alternative. Some studies have shown that xylitol can remineralise enamel; but these studies have been done using 20% xylitol solutions at 37^o C, over two weeks (with constant application), which isn't really relative to the real world. But yes, it has its benefits. It's in a decent number of toothpastes already, so feel free to use if you want.</p>
<p>Foaming agents. The most common foaming agent in toothpaste is Sodium Laureth/Lauryl Sulphate, the same stuff that is used to make liquid soap foam up. It's an irritant, and can cause problems in people with sensitivity to it, including ulcers (canker sores), lesions and general irritation. If you are susceptible, find a toothpaste that doesn't contain it. The amount of foam a toothpaste produces does not relate to its cleaning ability.</p>
<p>Baking soda! This stuff is present in Arm and Hammer and some off-brand products - it's basically an abrasive, and aids with whitening of teeth. The same caution applies as with all other whitening agents - it damages enamel. So approach with caution. Baking soda also neutralises acid in the mouth, but that effect will be negated as soon as you consume anything acidic. So very much a temporary solution.</p>
<p>/u/FranDankly very kindly <a href="https://www.lincolndentalcenter.com/relative-dentin-abrasivity-rda" target="_blank">provided a link</a> which covers the abrasiveness of various well known brands - it may prove useful for some. Note that abrasion is still beneficial in most cases, but excessive abrasion ain't good. Worth noting that most whitening toothpastes are on the higher end of the scale!</p>
<p>I think that's about it for now... but regardless of all the added info above, the action of brushing is <em>still</em> far more important than anything else (whether or not you combine with flossing). Brush dem teefs!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter JUST did a report on toothpaste for school so this info is fresh in my head.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Generally speaking there are no differences that make any one toothpaste better than any other toothpaste <em>at the job of being toothpaste</em>. All of them (or, funnily enough, none of them) will get your teeth equally clean, and any ancillary benefits that a toothpaste may claim have no effect on their ability to be toothpaste.</p>
<p>Full explanation: Toothpaste is considered a <strong>parity product</strong>. A parity product is any product that's functionally equivalent to any other competing product that may be offered by a competitor. Products like nails, peanut butter, gasoline, and soap are parity products because they are all functionally identical to products offered by competing companies.</p>
<p>Any differences in parity products are largely superficial, perceived, or add no <em>measurable</em> or <em>functional</em> benefit to the product. For example, some oil companies will tout how their pumps are equipped with special filters to make sure the gasoline coming out is more pure, or how they've got special additives to help engines run cleaner and more efficiently. The veracity of these claims are supported by the use of wiggle words like &quot;more&quot; or &quot;help&quot;, but fundamentally the gasoline from any given oil company is 100% identical to gasoline from any other oil company. Any difference in price between two competing gas stations has to do mainly with the effectiveness of their advertising. Lots of people would consider paying a bit more for gasoline from Dinoco than they would from MomsNPopsGas if they <em>thought</em> that Dinoco gas was better.</p>
<p>In specific regards to toothpaste, there are generally four ingredients in virtually all toothpastes: water, abrasives, sulfactants, and fluoride. Individual products are differentiated by colors, flavors, task-specific additives that aren't strictly necessary for the task of <em>toothpaste</em> (e.g., hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent, or potassium nitrate as a desensitizer), and of course packaging (striped toothpastes are popular). It's these non-purposed variations that give rise to the ten thousand different tubes of toothpaste in your supermarket.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: In the world of parity products, any competing product can legally call itself &quot;the best&quot; in its genre for the purposed task. Toothpaste's job is to help keep teeth clean (Another Fun Fact: brushing with or without toothpaste has no bearing on the amount of plaque removed from teeth) so if they all have the same <em>functional</em> ingredients then there can't be any one product that's better than any other; ergo, all products are &quot;the best&quot; at being toothpaste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's not very popular outside of scandinavia but here in Finland many toothpastes also contain xylitol on top of fluoride and these both have similar effect. Asian tourists seems to be stocking up on this stuff since you can't get it in most places. Most chewing gums here also contain xylitol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dad is a dentist... Toothpaste basically all the same ( unless you have sensitive teeth, then yes sensodine makes a difference). He said buy the flavor you like, he always got AIM or close up, which ever was cheaper. For him the type of toothbrush you use is more important. He is a big electric toothbrush advocate. He has used both oral B and so I are, he was usually trying out the newest model. </p>
<p>Flossing is also huge! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So all the top level answers are awesome and perfect but I do want to add an explanation about monofluorophosphate, sodium fluoride, and stannous fluoride.</p>
<p>The three substances listed are all fluoride ions but they are different. Stannous fluoride in particular is famous for its odd BUT benign side effect of staining the gums white temporarily. In some clinical studies, stannous fluoride was show to be slightly more effective than monofluorophosphate or sodium fluoride. However, the difference is largely negligible.</p>
<p>Basically as others have pointed out, as long as fluoride is present, toothpastes are more or less the same. Sulfate ingredients will make toothpaste extra foamy and baking soda or hydrogen peroxide will aid in removing surface stains. And of course sensodyne is perfect for those with sensitivity issues. </p>
<p>Tl;dr there are slight negligible differences between stannous fluoride, monofluorophosphate, and sodium fluoride.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
