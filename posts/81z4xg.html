Digestion takes energy, so the body directs that energy into other more important functions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’d be amazed at what severe sleep deprivation, hydrocodone (legally prescribed for several torn/herniated cervical and lumbar discs), and energy drinks will do to your mind and senses when working on dismembering human bodies for organ and tissue recovery and transplant. If there is enough interest, I’ll be happy to create a thread dedicated to my experiences in the field.
It was routine for us to work 48-72hrs with maybe one or two hrs “sleep” aka trying to doze while driving to the next location, sometimes 3-4hrs away. Something happens in the mind when faced with sights and smells that, when combined with actually slicing up a person, can only be described as puritifiably and morbidly fascinating.
I became numb to the sensory input and became experts at shutting off my conscious and senses while dismembering someone up for tissue recovery purposes. Murders, suicides, accidents, you name, I saw and dealt with it. The chronic and severe sleep deprivation, coupled with two other jobs in the same field, began to eat away at my health and sanity.
But that’s for a separate topic altogether. Red stimulates hunger. I can attest to that. And you would be hard pressed to distinguish a beef rump roast or filleted beef skirt from human thigh or butt muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
