		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Separation of Church and State means that the government cannot ban or restrict a religion, and they cannot require a religion (religious rule being set directly into law). It does not mean that they require the people in government to be secular/atheists. That would actually violate the first Amendment rights of those people. </p>
<p>Over 70% of the people in the US are Christian, and another 5-10% hold other religions. This means that most government officials will be religious and use their religions to influence their morals and how they vote. It also means that most of the people that they represent have religious views that need to be represented to some extent in how the laws that govern the land are crafted. If you were to forbid all religious language from usage at the government level that would not be possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seperation of Church and State means the government cannot instate a state religion or keep you from practising yours. It doesn't mean that individual politicians or even parties cannot use the bible / koran / torah / whatever other religious texts, to guide their principles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Political parties&quot; are really people. In most cases, the people from the parties that we hear and see are the ones trying to get someone elected -- themselves or someone else, for reasons they may or may not express honestly.</p>
<p>They want votes. Votes come from individuals, sure. But groups of people motivate and influence larger groups of people to do something a certain way, like vote. And churches, as a group of people, are usually great organizers. </p>
<p>Make those people happy, they should be more likely to vote for you, yeah?</p>
<p>Plus, currently, some people believe in a &quot;God&quot;.  Some don't.  Currently, it is believed that LESS people are offended by the use of the term &quot;God&quot; than are offended by someone not using the reference. A rule of politics and getting elected is to make the least number of people unhappy.</p>
<p>It's not about faith, or following a faith. It's about numbers and using them to get what you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I think it is important to quote the actual constitution here, because I think most people believe the constitution says that there is a separation of church and state in the constitution which isn't accurate.</p>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.</p>
<p>Those people who are saying God so frequently are practicing their free exercise of religion. The US was set up in such a way that allows for anyone of any faith to practice their religion. Assuming that their religion doesn't violate some other law. </p>
<p>This freedom of religion is countered by the establishment clause which says that the US can not establish a religion. Meaning that no one can make you go to church or tell you that you must follow X religion. </p>
<p>I personally really like it. I think that religion is a great thing, and that people should give it a chance. If you don't like religion that is fine. I won't try to silence you if you won't try and silence me. Which I think is really the genius of the Constitution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
