<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/new-fcc-rule-protects-users-from-the-prying-eyes-of-isps/" target="_blank">FCC rule they repealed</a> was only passed back in October 2016, and wasn't set to take effect until at least October 2017.</p>
<p>Basically, nothing has changed.  ISP's are allowed to sell all the same information they've been allowed to sell for the past 15ish years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can't go selling us out yet!  There are things you can do!</p>
<p>First up - all SSL communications will be secure for the most part.</p>
<p>Second - use of IPv6 will be the largest decrease in privacy - don't be quick to embrace IPv6 if you're not randomizing your radio's MAC addresses on each tower/AP change.  If the MAC stays the same, then you will be clearly identifiable as you move from one network to the next - so advertisers and other tracking will know you, no matter your current network.</p>
<p>1) Wait for your ISP to publicly state what they're going to sell and how they're going to sell it.</p>
<p>2) Many ISP contracts do have clauses that protect users anonymity - those will have to change.</p>
<p>3) The upcoming changes will not permit ISP's to become a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) for your SSL communications.</p>
<p>I know that Comcast has been preventing folks from learning who their customers specifically are for ages - hopefully this will continue - that or everyone who loads utorrent will get a letter from HBO.</p>
<p>The largest trove of information that will be collected won't be from direct traffic metrics, but from a combination of the ISP's DHCP and DNS servers - as these can be used to identify every website you access and what you access them with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Baffles me that people don't actually pay attention to what the story actually is about and it doesn't take more than actually reading an article to understand it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-02/pdf/2016-28006.pdf" target="_blank">policy was put in place in December by the Obama Administration</a> when they were leaving office.  It is now likely being repealed so there is no real change.</p>
<p>Everything that has been going on for years will be going on.  Nothing changes.  This wasn't a hot topic in December because it wasn't that big of a deal one way or the other.  No one championed it as a huge win for privacy.  </p>
<p>Big tech companies like Google and Facebook which already capture this data and sell it don't like the competition from ISPs.  If ISPs can't sell it then the firms that are gathering the data can charge more for the data.  This is simple.  Both sides have been trying to take care of their donors.  It was why the Obama Administration put the favor of a policy in place before leaving office and is why the Trump administration is supporting the repeal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is what is so jacked up about everyone getting their panties in a bunch over this. Yes, the rule sucks, yes I am 100% against mining and selling data, but we let this happen and I have been yelling about it for years.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind, that Google invented Gmail just for that purpose. They have bots that 'read' your email so they can sell the results to people. They came out with a browser to mine data, and Google certainly did not create DNS servers out of some sort of charity. When you give Google access to your phone, they read all the phone numbers, names, address and email addresses, dump them in a database, and then link everyone of your contacts with a name, phone number and a unique identifier. They mine for birthdate, gender, income, etc. </p>
<p>Facebook is just as bad. When they offer to 'find friends' if you give them your email password, they look in your book, cross reference names to numbers to addresses, to your and your friends Facebook profile, figure out level of education, birthday, house value, income, marital status and children. That is all for sale. Even if you do not give them your password, your grandmother or friend might, and then it is all up for grabs.</p>
<p>This isn't some conspiracy theory or paranoia, this is their actual business model, data mining. All the rules say now (as always) is that your ISP can do what Google, Facebook and Microsoft have been doing for years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
