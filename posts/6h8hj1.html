Do these calories represent what our bodies will be able to absorb or the total number of absorbed calories differ from what is mentioned?</p>
<p>In other words, is the calories information mentioned on a food item already adjusted for the losses during digestion?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the answers. I am trying to lose weight so I do watch my calories closelyand that's how I ended up with this question in my head.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically it's adjusted (lowered) to what we can metabolize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of note, it is important to distinguish that food label calories actually represent metabolizable energy, which is total caloric content minus calories that are presumably not absorbed by the body and excreted as waste. Therefore, the absolute amount of calories in food is higher than the calories stated on the label and this was evident in our sample of snack food items (6.7 kcal [âˆ’4.9, 31.9], p \&lt; 0.05). Since nutrient absorption has a high inter-individual variability in humans (22), it may be of more value to report gross calories on food labels as a more reproducible measure of caloric content in prepackaged snack food items.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With direct bomb calorimetry, calories can act as an upper limit of the energy in food, but how much of that energy is actually able to be used is dependent on a variety of factors including it's ability to be broken down due to microbes in your gut, the properties of the food, and your genetics. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/</a></p>
<p>Calories listed on the nutritional info do get adjusted by something called Atwater numbers, which are determined by having people consume a given food, keeping them in an isolated environment, and then performing further calorimetry on their fecal matter to determine how much energy wasn't absorbed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have two other questions related to this</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do calories always go to energy + fat storage or can some be wasted?  I'm not sure what &quot;losses during digestion&quot; means in the original question.  I assume it means they leave the body in some way without the nutrients being used, ie there are still calories leftover.</p>
</li>
<li>Does meal size have any factor in this?  For example if you ate a 2000 calorie meal its safe to say some will get stored as fat but does the body ever say &quot;I don't want to deal with all this&quot; and ignore a couple hundred of those calories that go straight to waste?  Essentially the larger the meal the larger the larger % of calories are ignored.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NO.</p>
<p>Scientific American just ran an article on this last month.</p>
<p>What I remember from the article are two things:</p>
<p>1)  This research is very expensive and has very few results after over 20 years.</p>
<p>2)  The researchers found quite a few examples where there were drastic differences.  For instance, only 1/3 of calories were absorbed by the body when eating whole almonds, but 100 percent of calories were absorbed when eating almond butter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
