<p>I think there are a few reasons. But let me preface this by saying that in the hospital, we don't really try to do this. This is a non-medical thing that has crept into the collective consciousness. Having said that, if a trauma health care provider knows something more, I am willing to be corrected.</p>
<p>1) Reassurance. It's more reassuring to have someone awake and communicating as opposed to being unconscious;</p>
<p>2) If a trauma victim can maintain consciousness, it's considered a good sign - they have enough perfusion, oxygen/blood supply to the brain;</p>
<p>3) <strong>Medically</strong> however, if you are unconscious, you cannot protect your airway. You can obstruct your airway and now the care provider has to worry about maintaining your airway.
You can vomit and aspirate (inhale) the vomit which is <em>no bueno</em> medically speaking.
Unconsciousness indicates a deteriorating health status and knocks down your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale" target="_blank">Glasgow Coma Scale</a> points. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Staying awake in this situation can be the difference between life and death because if you start to freeze to death while asleep you’re very unlikely to wake up during the process. Staying awake allows you to keep moving and generating body heat when you get too cold (assuming you have the willpower to do this instead of passing out, which being too cold can do to you). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you're awake you're not dead. A doctor would be able to define the line between the 2 points better, but with no medical training &quot;awake means not dead&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Everyone here is saying it’s to monitor their neurological status, which is important to do, but if you want to do that you can just wake them up. Everyone who is admitted to the hospital with a head injury is allowed to sleep and we just wake them up every hour to two hours (depending on the severity) to check their neurological status. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
