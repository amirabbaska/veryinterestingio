		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More heat: more energy to the molecules.</p>
<p>More energy, more movement, the molecules will weaken and cut the low energy bonds that let them stick together like hydrogen bonds or Van der Waals bonds. </p>
<p>In this way fat molecules won't have a strong grip on other fat molecules. </p>
<p>Think of butter, it needs very little heat to reach a liquid state, because they are have enough energy to destroy their bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chem 12 student here so I'll take a shot:</p>
<p>The process of cleaning a dish involves the bonding of soap particles to grease particles, which are then washed off the plate and down the drain. (Side note: The bonds between the grease particles and soap are stronger than the bonds formed between your plate and the grease, so the latter bonds break) According to collision theory, for a bond to be successful it needs to:</p>
<p>1 Have a minimum amount of energy (speed of particles) to form a bond.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2 Have the correct geometry in the collision. </p>
<p>Since hot water increases the amount of energy in both particles by transfering energy, this increases the number of successful collisions possible. Thus, more particles are being bound together and pulled off the plate down your drain.</p>
<p>With cold water, the opposite occurs. It slows down a lot of these particles, so the number of collisions possible is reduced, meaning more particles stick to the plate because the bonds don't form in the first place.</p>
<p>Edit: tyour -&gt; your , changed numbered list because formatting changed</p>
<p>Edit 2: So I'm completely wrong. u/artofengineering seems to know his stuff, so please look to his answer instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinetic Molecular Theory basically states that particles move faster with more energy. Faster movement means more interactions. Average Kinetic Energy is measured as temperature. Basically, the molecules move faster and bump into eachother more. The soap serves as an interface between the grease and the water, allowing the water to wash away and essentially break down or dissolve the grease. Still possible in cold water, but slower and thanks to solubility being smaller in cold water you may need to change it more often, or run more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's taking a super scientific explanation to this. The best example that I had to convince my parents from switching washing from cold water to hot was that:</p>
<p>Heat loosens up grease a lot better than cold water can. Think of bacon fat turning into a liquid state and running off of the pan vs. trying to rub off caked-on cold grease.</p>
<p>Food bits on your plates stick to it stubbornly because it's dry and greasy. The best way to remove it with ease is to re-hydrate it and loosen up the grease by soaking it in hot water.</p>
<p>Same method applies to creating a sauce from fond, which is the delicious flavor-filled brown bits that gets stuck on the pan after searing your meat. You remove it off the pan and also create a wonderful flavorful sauce by adding a liquid to boil it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
