		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to do, there's a few challenges.</p>
<p>First of all, both your wifi and cellular interfaces will have different IP addresses, this means that for any connection that needs to maintain a conversation, it will only be able to do so with one of the two.</p>
<p>Other kinds of connections, like http requests that aren't dependent on the session or state CAN use both interfaces to help speed up downloads etc.  But you might also run into situations where there is an expectation that everything happens over one address, and that could cause technical issues too. </p>
<p>But I think another real issue is expectation and billing.  Most places charge very different for cellular data than residential internet packages.  If you're at home watching youtube videos on your phone and your residential internet slows down, and your cellular data kicks in to keep you watching that stream in full 1080p without you realizing it, you might end up with unexpected data charges. </p>
<p>It's a lot easier conceptually (and technically) to just switch to one network or the other for all data. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-WLAN_Aggregation" target="_blank">LWA</a> and it's coming. </p>
<p>Basically the Industry has a bunch of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware - requires a smart, power hungry chip in the device</li>
<li>Software - needs also to be smart and user-agnostic</li>
<li>Licensing - big money in these technologies. Fights ensue (see Everyone vs Qualcomm)</li>
<li>Network - need backend to know what's going on on the device</li>
</ul>
<p>So all these manufacturers (Apple, Samsung) and infrastructure vendors (Ericsson, Huawei), chipset makers (Qualcomm, Intel), and network service providers (AT&amp;T, China Mobile) get together with the standards body (3GPP) and argue for years over what the &quot;customer&quot; needs. Then they publish a standard (e.g. 3GPP Rel. 13) and sanction what everyone ALLOWED to do. </p>
<p>Then 12-18 months later, 1-2 network vendors deploy 1-2 live networks in 1-2 service providers that 1-2 OEMs support. Then there's a waterfall effect that rolls out more broadly, and by that time the next release is out and a new standard is being chased. </p>
<p>TL;DR money+time = everything happens eventually. </p>
<p>Also, for everyone saying &quot;smart network switch&quot; - that's definitely not it. That is a &quot;switching&quot; and it's a marketing deal developed by Samsung &amp; Qualcomm. Simultaneous (50/50) is only possible through Aggregation, and is only a Rel. 12 and Rel. 13 feature (2016 and beyond). Several have pointed out that there are two radios and therefore only one can be active at a time. This is true, but again, only up until 2016 when the Aggregation standards were published to combine the radio frequencies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually this option is now available on smartphones. If the wifi signal is weak your smartphone starts taking help from your data package.</p>
<p>For IOS: Goto settings -&gt; mobile data -&gt; scroll to the bottom and turn on 'Wifi Assist'</p>
<p>For android: Most cells have a setting called Smart Network Switch, it is probably under your WiFi settings. It uses both WiFi and your 4g connection. But it also depends on phone. (had no idea about android before this. answer copied from u/Photographer_Rob)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, this technology has been available for a while. Initially though, many manufacturers or carriers turn it off by default. They don't want less savvy users kicking in their doors, furious that they've burned through their data while on WiFi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are two different physical devices, one radio for WiFi signals, another radio for cell signals. They speak in different languages, and would have to decide between themselves which 50% of traffic each will handle. The signals also wouldn't reach the phone simultaneously, so there would be a delay while it builds a buffer. Your phone uses them both, but not simultaneously; it switches back and forth. </p>
<p>It's very hard to ELI5, but imagine you are holding a walkie talkie in one hand, and phone in the other. The person you are talking to speaks German into the walkie talkie, and Italian into the phone. They switch between the phone and walkie talkie while they're speaking, sometimes saying the first half of a word in German into the walkie talkie, and the second half in Italian into the phone, and sometimes you hear the last part of the word before the first part. How hard would it be to actually understand that conversation?</p>
<p>Edit: source: former DevOps engineer for the R&amp;D department of the largest mobile semi-conductor company.</p>
<p>Edit 2: The functionality everyone is saying currently exists is analogous to holding only the walkie talkie or phone, putting one down when picking the other up. OP is asking why we can't hold both up, one to each ear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
