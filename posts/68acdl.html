		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The white/cloudiness is mostly small bubbles of air that was previously dissolved in the water when it was a liquid. Residential ice makers form the top down. The top layer of water freezes and slowly the ice grows downwards into the mold. This trap the air that was previously dissolved into the water. </p>
<p>Commercial ice makers form ice from the bottom up, this lets the gas escape. Additionally they may use water that was additionally filtered through a carbon tank to remove off flavors, water softener to reduce calcium and other minerals, or reverse osmosis to make it &quot;pure&quot; water.</p>
<p>Boil and cool the water before freezing it, and you'll get almost clear ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clear commercial ice is made in a machine called a Clinebell chiller. It freezes water from the bottom up, and as the ice freezes it forces dissolved air and other impurities upwards into the unfrozen water above the ice. Before all the water is frozen, the &quot;dirty&quot; unfrozen water is discarded, and the clear frozen column is then removed and cut up.</p>
<p>You can approximate this at home by taking one of those styrofoam coolers and filling it with (filtered then boiled then cooled to room temp) water, and then placing it (without the lid) into your freezer. It will freeze from the top down, and will force any impurities into the remaining liquid water, like a Clinebell in reverse. When about 2/3 of the water is frozen, remove the block of ice. It should be almost perfectly clear. Discard the remaining water, which will look dirty beyond belief.  Then cut up the block of ice into 1&quot; cubes for your artisinal-style cocktails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work on/sell/lease Ice Machines for a living.</p>
<p>The short answer for commercial Ice Machines is that they circulate water over the evaporator (where the ice is mace) so that Ice forms almost like an icicle. This means that no air bubbles are in the ice: it's pure water. </p>
<p>In an ice cube tray or an ice maker in a residential freezer, cups are filled with water and frozen. The air is frozen in with it. This is why sometimes the ice tastes bad: whatever odors are in the air in your freezer are being frozen in with the ice.</p>
<p>Any follow up questions I will do my best with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clear ice melts much more slowly too, hence it being popular commercially (it also won't dilute your spirits too much if you choose to take your time and savour it..)</p>
<p>If you freeze water really slowly in your own freezer, then it will be fairly clear too. There are ice moulds out there that are 'insulated' (say, thick rubber) that enables this. Ball shaped ones too for use in certain drinks.. At the price though, you have to REALLY want clear ice balls..</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, as the water freezes in your home icemaker, the freezing starts at the edges of the mold and traps the air in the center of the cube making it cloudy. &quot;Directional freezing&quot; yields a clear cube. The best way to accomplish this is a small insulated container filled with water placed inside of the freezer. The ice will form from the top down, driving the air into the liquid water below. When the layer of ice on top reaches the desired thickness, (which may take 24 hours or more), remove it from the freezer and cut it into cubes. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7CuaIt9.jpg" target="_blank">my cubes</a></p>
<p>Distilled water boiled water, vibrating trays, etc. are pretty ineffective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
