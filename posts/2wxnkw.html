		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drug cartels are criminal organizations, they are not exclusively drug dealers, they also kidnap, blackmail, extort, murder etc.  Lately they steal oil from the big pipelines by busting a segment and filling trucks to sell to highest bidder, there are claims that these activities are more profitable for some of them than the drug trade.</p>
<p>Legalizing drugs would have very deep impact on mexican society but it will not suddently make cartels into law abiding citizens. Organized crime has deep roots in many cities and sadly with the levels of corruption in mexico it's very difficult to fight against an enemy that is also your government, police, judge, and neighbor.</p>
<p>Its also a belief of many people that destabilizing cartels will only have infinitely worse consecuenses than letting them operate. Mexico had 2 events that destabilized the status quo of the drug trade, one was the end of the dinasty of the ruling party PRI, the other one was the &quot;war on drugs&quot; the last president waged. Both had disgusting results for the normal people.</p>
<p>from 2006:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Mexican President Felipe Calderón declared war on drug cartels in 2006, the country's death toll related to drug crime has been around 30,000.[3] Mayors and police have been specifically targeted; some beheaded, some tortured to death </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mexico has suffered staggering levels of violence and crime during the country’s seven-year-long war against the cartels. The fighting has killed 90,000 people so far, a death toll larger, as of this writing, than that of the civil war in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently focus has been on politicians with connections to drug cartels; The current mexican president is a bit of a buffoon and one very shocking event involving 43 students that were killed in what can only be described as the three stooges committing mass murder with Benny hill playing in the background, is currently shocking the nation and hopefully some good news will come out of this public outrage of governmental corruption, negligence and stupidity. </p>
<p>TL/DR: Cartels are not only in drugs, they are scary and every time mexico pokes them things get REAL fucking crazy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>most of the marijuana grown in Mexico is smuggled abroad, so legalization in Mexico wouldn't change much</li>
<li>the US really doesn't want Mexico to do that, and would use diplomatic and economic pressure to try to stop them</li>
<li>Mexico gets a lot of US aid for &quot;fighting&quot; drug smuggling, and doesn't want that to dry up</li>
<li>there are UN resolutions that allow sanctions against countries that participate in the illegal drug trade</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Mexican government tried to do that in 2006 but the US wouldn't let them. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox actually passed a law decriminalizing small amounts of drugs, then had to rescind it due to intense pressure from the Bush administration over concerns about &quot;drug tourism.&quot; Here's a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/04/world/americas/04mexico.html" target="_blank">NYT link talking about it.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cartels can survive without Marijuana. In fact, they couldn't care less about marijuana. They make money from other drugs(cocaine) and from people(corrupt politicians, kidnappings, coyotes etc.) Lets take the Zetas as an example... The best way to describe them is that they are like an illegal IRS. If they catch you doing any illegal activity in their area or &quot;plaza&quot;, then you have to pay a &quot;tax&quot; in order to continue that illegal activity. OR you don't pay, and they simply kill you or your family. They call it, &quot;pagando piso&quot; or the popular phrase, &quot;plata o plomo&quot;. At the same time it is so easy for them to transport drugs. A lot easier than you think. Usually the drugs that law enforcement catches in the US are planned to be caught on purpose. Cartels call in &quot;tips&quot; to the police, customs, &amp; border patrol. For example, they'll call in a loaded drug truck with the exact description and location to where it will pass. Law enforcement will catch it, and the cartels will pass several other trucks at other locations while the law enforcement are &quot;distracted&quot; with this one location or truck. Law enforcement get their share of the pie and cartels get the rest of the pie. </p>
<p>This war will only stop if the weapon supplier stops(USA). This is a 2 way street and if the US doesn't stop gun flow into Mexico, then these cartels will continue to operate. We also need to reform the immigration process because cartels make a lot of money from crossing desperate illegals. Marijuana legalization will make no difference.</p>
<p>*EDIT: The people being caught in these trucks, smuggling drugs, or storing drugs are actually forced to do this. &quot;Cross the truck/drugs or your wife/kid dies&quot;. Not only is it a threat, but they will prove to that person that they are serious by showing a picture of the family or telling them the address of their house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The drug cartels don't make most of their money in Mexico, they make it from the United States. Also, marijuana is such a small part of the drug cartels, that even if Mexico and the US legalized marijuana, this wouldn't even make a dent in the drug cartels financials. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
