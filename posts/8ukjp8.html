<p>The metabolites you mention probably stick around for a long time because of the nature of the tissue that they end up in. The &quot;palmitate&quot; in ethyl palmitate is a saturated fatty acid. It will be very soluble in fat and will likely end up in adipose tissue, which is biochemically speaking pretty stable. Your fat changes a lot more slowly than other parts of your body since its function is backup/long-term energy storage. Anything that is very fat-soluble (hydrophobic) can end up in the same boat, and as a result can often be detected at low levels for months or even years. </p>
<p>Upon cursory inspection, ethyl glucuronide is a little different. It's a sugar derivative and wikipedia says that it can be detected at very low levels - in other words it can be detected even after most of it has been metabolized or excreted. There is also a suggestion that it can be incorporated into non-metabolically active tissue like keratin in hair and nails. Keratin is &quot;dead&quot;, so once a molecule is incorporated it will remain there until the underlying material is degraded. </p>
<p>These sort of address your broader question as well. Some metabolites are more likely to stick around for a long time because they end up in places that don't experience much rapid change. Another possibility is if you lack the metabolic capacity to remove a given substance, like with trans fats or lots of genetic disorders like PKU. As I said, I'm a chemist so I don't really know of any particular pattern of foodstuffs or how they would fit into this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22959954" target="_blank">Lowering dietary linoleic acid reduces bioactive oxidized linoleic acid metabolites in humans.</a></p>
<p>&quot;Linoleic acid (LA) is the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in human diets, a major component of human tissues, and the direct precursor to the bioactive oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs), 9- and 13 hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9- and 13-HODE) and 9- and 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9- and 13-oxoODE). These four OXLAMs have been mechanistically linked to pathological conditions ranging from cardiovascular disease to chronic pain. Plasma OXLAMs, which are elevated in Alzheimer's dementia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, have been proposed as biomarkers useful for indicating the presence and severity of both conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the United States, per capita dietary LA tripled from about 2% of energy (en%) to 7 en% during the 20th century [49], which coincided with a marked increase in adipose tissue LA [50,51,52]. Because human adipose tissue LA has a half-life of 1-2 years ...&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Bedaquiline and M2 both have long terminal elimination half-lives (t1/2term) in plasma. After 8 weeks of bedaquiline administration (2 weeks at 400 mg once daily followed by 6 weeks at 200 mg three times a week) in patients with MDR-TB, the mean t1/2term was 164 days (range 62 – 408 days) for bedaquiline and 159 days (range 69–407 days) for M2. <strong><em>Consequently, plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and M2 were still quantifiable in almost all patients at study completion, 96 weeks after finishing treatment.</em></strong> At this time, the median concentration was 0.010 mg/L (range 0.00224 – 0.0436 mg/L) for bedaquiline and 0.00258 mg/L (range 0.00164 – 0.0116 mg/L) for M2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outside of bone-seeking minerals/isotopes (which are in a class of their own) and normal dietary nutrients (which is technically a completely different topic), I believe that bedaquiline is probably by far the longest-detectable medication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Everything your body processes will produce metabolites.  The duration that these metabolites reside in your body can very from a few hours to months or even years.  How long a metabolite remains in your body depends on many, many factors too numerous to list here.  Basic things like whether the metabolite is fat soluble vs water soluble can have a big impact on how long that metabolite stays in your body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if I consumed caffeine how long would you theoretically be able to test for it if you wanted to? What about broccoli, or carrots etc?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure on those particular substances.  I'm familiar with a field where the detection of long-term metabolites in urine is a pretty hot topic.  Most substances produce multiple metabolites, and those metabolites themselves can be metabolized and produced further metabolites.  For example, the steroid Nortestosterone produces the metabolites norandrosterone and noretiocholanelone, just to illustrate one substance that has multiple metabolites.  The metabolites produced within a single substance can also very based on the molecular configuration (IE isomer) of the parent compound. The daughter compounds of the parent can actually be somewhat predicted based on the molecular structure of the parent compound.  A-ring metabolism of 1-ene and 1,4-diene steroids tend to undergo reduction at the Carbons located at positions 1 and 2.  Carbons on the B-ring will undergo different reactions than the A-ring, and the C-ring will be different yet again, as will the D-ring.  This allows a molecular chemist to analyze the metabolites found in, say, urine and then reconstruct what the parent compound was, which is an important part of metabolite discovery.  Metabolites of a molecule can also be found in different concentrations based on the route of administration - for example, oral steroids will produce the same metabolites as transdermal steroids, but the metabolites will be found in different relative amounts.  Multiple different enzymes can metabolize the same substrate (parent molecule) and produce different daughter compounds as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there any factors that cause metabolites to stick around longer, or certain groups of foods?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! One of the 'goals' of metabolizing substances is to facilitate the elimination of that substance, usually be increasing the polarity of the substance.  Metabolites with low polarities are less likely to be excreted, so they can stick around longer!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, metabolic pathways (the process of going from parent compound to final daughter compound(s)) are <em>incredibly</em> complex, and are also subject to inter-individual variability (not everyone processes things exactly the same, based on enzyme levels and things like that).  There are a variety of factors that can influence how long a metabolite remains in the body.  Some metabolites are only detectable for hours, some for months or years.  A single parent can produce both short-lasting and long-lasting metabolites (as seen in, for example, clomiphene metabolites).  Molecular configuration (cis/trans and levo/dextro isomers) can have a large influence on what metabolites are produced.</p>
