		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can mean different things. A home router is often a router and a modem combined, but the router part tends to be pretty crappy.</p>
<p>Bridge mode basically disables the router part, allowing you to use the modem to connect a second device directly to the Internet.</p>
<p>The downside is that you can only connect one device this way (usually). Hence, it is usually used to connect a second, better router. The upside is that the slow and buggy built-in router goes out of the way.</p>
<p>Then there's also bridge in the context of WiFi, which was already explained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In computer networking with the tcp/ip protocol (the one the internet uses), you have small networks linked together by routers to become a large internetwork. </p>
<p>A single network is identified by its use of a single tcp/ip addressing “subnet”. In tcp/ip, every computer on the network has an IP address, and you can use that address to figure out which of all the connected networks that computer is on. Imagine that a subnet is like the block your home is on, and if you saw the home address of another house you’d be able to tell just by looking at the address if that house is on your block or another block. </p>
<p>So routers are the things that connect subnets together, that take network “traffic” and forward it to the next subnet if it’s supposed to go that way. </p>
<p>But if you change the router to “bridge” mode, that tells the router to treat both sides, both networks, as if they’re the same subnet. Effectively it makes a transparent connection between the two networks so they become one. The ip addresses on both sides have to be in the same subnet. The “bridge mode” router now forwards ALL traffic it sees on one side to the other side automatically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So before this question can be answered I feel like an explanation of what a router does and what a bridge does in the context of networking is useful</p>
<p>In networking routers and bridges were kind of designed to do the same thing. Take two separate networks and connect them together. The major difference is how that is done. With a bridge the two networks are connected together to make 1 larger network. With a router, the two networks remain unchanged, but they still gain the ability to communicate with each other. </p>
<p>In terms of a home router, or router that is supplied by the ISP. Think about the internet as one network, and your computers and devices as another. In bridge mode, your devices are connected directly to the internet. In routed mode your devices are connected to their own network, but gain the ability to communicate with the internet. This is much more secure way to connect your devices to the internet. </p>
<p>Like any other product, routers can vary in performance, and features, so bridged mode is useful when the modem/router combo your ISP supplies you does not meet your needs and you'd like to add your own. So you place the modem/router into bridge mode, and then connect your own router. Then it's like your router has been directly connected to the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a &quot;bridge mode&quot; in all-in-one modem/router/wifi combo boxes that disables the router and wifi so you could use your own/better equipment if desired.</p>
<p>If bridge mode is disabled and you put in your own router down stream (most times) you're going to have internet issues.</p>
<p>I can get more detailed and non-eli5 if wanted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A practical example I've used: I had my phone, laptop, and another device with only wired ethernet.
My phone has 3G internet and can hotspot my laptop over wifi.
My laptop has wifi and an ethernet port.</p>
<p>I bridged my laptops wifi+ethernet port while on my phone's hotspot.</p>
