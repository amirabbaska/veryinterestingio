		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would take a lot of variables. But yes, I believe you could. Viscosity and density of both at various temperatures are already known. You'd have to specify &quot;oil&quot; of course. Olive, evoo, crude, gasoline, Castrol synthetic...</p>
<p>Shape of container? 5oz mustard and 5oz salad jars would have different times due to surface area, shape.</p>
<p>Material of container might be a factor.</p>
<p>Edit.</p>
<p>How it's shaken/stirred. Shake weight? Drill stirrer? (How they get the liquid moving matters.</p>
<p>Droplet size too. And dispersion. I'd assume a homogeneous size and spread personally, just to make it easier.</p>
<p>Still water or moving? Laminar or turbulent flow?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doing this from first principles (only using chemical/physical properties and known relationships) wouldnt really be <del>feasible</del> practical. There are too many variables. You need to make the system more specific and then test a single variable to get a sense of the behavior. Plenty of people have already done that for this problem since it's common to several industries. At that point people will develop empirical relationships for their specific system to help predict behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That industry directly deals with the separation of fats, oils, and grease from water.  It doesn't go hardcore into the math, but helps you understand what is going on.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are stable Oil/water emulsions which will not separate in any reasonable timespan.</p>
<p>The oils can form micelles or liposomes which are energetically stable. This is often used in the medical industry to encapsulate medicines to slowly release their content over the period of days or weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up spinodal decomposition. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition</a></p>
<p>Simply put, this is a problem entirely about energy. Yes it would be possible to calculate the time, but as some other folks have said, there are a number of variables... although I think it would be simpler than most people are thinking - but that may just be me fondly remembering kinetics. Oil (type?) and water are well known so many of the required variables are likely available on the Internet.</p>
<p>I can see an experiment where one could heat water up to mix with oil and then rapidly cool it to a temperature that would cause separation (based on the phase diagram ie spinodal decomposition) and then time it until the oil had visually separated. I suppose the experiment is probably easier than calculating.</p>
<p>TLDR: Yes</p>
