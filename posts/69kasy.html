		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original inspiration for holography is black hole thermodynamics. Black hole entropy (which you can obtain from Hawking's expression for the temperature) is area-intensive, and has thus holographic character. In general, <em>any</em> gravitational theory (in which it is possible to create black holes) will display an area-intensive maximum entropy (see Bekenstein bound). This does not directly imply holography, but it's very hard to fit in any other framework.</p>
<p>Holography however starts really coming together only when you find explicit examples of holographic dualities, which started popping up in string theory (AdS/CFT and co.). Not only have we come to understand that string theory implies holography, but also that holography is necessarily stringy. Nowadays, we think of holography as providing the microscopic <em>definition</em> of a string theory!</p>
<p>So I would argue the role of your &quot;logical leap&quot; is definitely to be embodied by string theory. It's not a small jump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is not my specialty, but I can relay some things I've learned in various lectures. Holography seems to come in when you try to combine gravity and quantum mechanics, even from very general considerations.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the notion of probability is inherently associated with various notions of infinity. In quantum-sensitive experiments, we tend to think of the system we're examining as &quot;quantum&quot;, whereas our instruments, measuring devices, laboratories, even our brains, are &quot;classical&quot;. This is wrong, everything is quantum. However the reason it's OK to practically think in this fashion is that our laboratories etc are macroscopic (composed of many degrees of freedom). Any probability of some weird quantum shit happening is exponentially suppressed, and thus practically negligible, but still technically there. If you want a truly &quot;classical&quot; object, it needs to have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Thus well-defined quantum probabilities require infinitely large laboratories (conceptually speaking).</p>
<p>When you add gravity, things get weird. We know that if you put enough mass into a space, eventually it will create a black hole. Thus if we want to build an infinitely large laboratory (again, conceptually speaking), we must continually enlarge the volume it encompasses. Since we are taking the infinite limit, this pushes the laboratory to the boundaries of the space you're in, possibly to infinity. Thus we say that in quantum gravity there are no &quot;local&quot; variables; all of the things that conceptually make sense, <em>from the get go</em>, are variables that exist at the boundary of your space. This implies holography, because it implies the theory must be formulated in terms of boundary variables.</p>
<p>If you now consider that the universe is expanding, and that the expansion is accelerating, we lose even those boundary variables. In that case we're totally lost; what is the theory even <em>about</em> any more? However this point I don't totally understand. Keep in mind my comment is a hand waving relay of (frankly) a hand waving (but still very good) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87lz3U4CkPU" target="_blank">technical lecture</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Afaik, the argumentation kind of goes like</p>
<p>What we know about the thermodynamics of black holes implies that the maximum entropy of a region in spacetime doesn't scale with its volume but its surface. Now because entropy is equivalent to content of information, it is principally possible that a theory describing physics in a space is equivalent to a theory on that space's surface (as the surface could in principle contain all information the space inside does due to the surface proportional maximum entropy scaling). Now because theories of quantum gravity can describe black holes, they might also tell us more about the holographic principle. </p>
<p>That's at least what I understand of it, but my knowledge on the topic is very superficial. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The holographic principle comes more naturally from information theory, which, just like other math, is playing a larger part in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>The speed of light is also called the speed of causality, and &quot;causality&quot; ties deeply into information theory.  A blackhole has gravity so intense that even light cannot escape its schwarzschild radius.  That also meant that information cannot escape, or so people thought.  Once Hawking radiation was theorized as a way for a blackhole to dissipate, a new problem was posed: can we destroy information by throwing it into a blackhole and letting it dissipate?</p>
<p>The resolution to preserve information was to let Hawking radiation carry the information from inside the black hole as it dissipates away.  For this to happen, the information of the volumetric space (spherical blackhole) had to be equal to the information of the surface area (Hawking radiation).  In fact, you can draw a sphere around the entire observable universe and imagine it collapses into a blackhole and therefore all volumetric information has to be equal to the surface information.  This is the holographic principle.</p>
<p>This has an interesting ramification due to the Planck length and Heisenberg uncertainty.   The information of the surface is at a coarse resolution (Plank squared) while the information of the volume is a higher resolution (Planck cubed).  This means the allowable information in a volumetric space is vastly less than implied by volumetric Planck scale, since it had to be equal to the surface resolution.  We don't know how the information is encoded in Hawking radiation, but we have encoded 3D wavefront information onto 2D paper called holograms and borrowed that name as an analogy when referring to dissipating blackholes and radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
