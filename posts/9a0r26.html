<p>I don't think it's a stretch to assume a present day human could  successfully reproduce with another human from that era. As far as our genetics are concerned there haven't been any major mutations that set us apart from them</p>
<p>Hell if it turns out H. erectus or H. habilis also have 23 chromosomes then it's possible we could produce offspring with them too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you were to try to breed with a human from before this mutation you would probably be unsuccessful. </p>
<p>I donâ€™t know when this happened, it must have been during Homo Erectus or earlier since we know that Sapiens bred with at least two other descendants of Erectus the Neanderthals and Denosovians.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oldest human ancestor we can produce viable offspring with is at least 300,000 years old. We have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12961#ref1" target="_blank">evidence</a> that modern humans were able to produce offspring with neanderthals and Denisovans, suggesting that our common ancestor would also produce viable offspring. The human-neanderthal(and Denisovan) common ancestor is estimated to have existed between [300-800 thousand years ago]
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution#Homo" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution#Homo</a>). </p>
<p>It's likely that we could reproduce with older ancestors due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding_between_archaic_and_modern_humans" target="_blank">how common and successful interbreeding between modern and archaic humans was.</a> Unfortunately we lack the genetic material from the older ancestral creatures to confirm this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will surprise you to know that, although the answer is most likely &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;not easily,&quot; it is an unanswered question to science whether or not it is possible for humans and Chimpanzees to interbreed. There are other animals that are similarly distantly related, and with more differing chromosome structure that <em>can</em> interbreed, though usually with infertile offspring.</p>
<p>We can for sure interbreed with our various cousins from a few hundred thousand years ago. So ultimately the answer is we just don't really know. Somewhere between 500000 and 7000000 years or so.</p>
<p>The ability to breed is actually not a perfect species definition; nothing is because of the immense complexity of genetics and evolution. Many animals that we have different species names for can interbreed successfully under the right conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a tough question to answer because the concept of a species describes a snapshot of diversity in the modern world. Do members of a population viable offspring? Okay, then they're the same species. Even species like lions and tigers, which *can* produce viable offspring, are considered different species because they *don't* reproduce in the wild. When we try to apply the species concept in the past, it falls apart a bit because we can't put populations to that same test. When discussing changes that accumulate over generations and eventually lead to a new species, we use the chronospecies concept (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronospecies" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronospecies" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronospecies</a></a>), which involves specialists making a determination based on morphological differences. This is, obviously, really tough, and is further complicated by the small sample sizes the deeper we go into the past. If we go back to 6 or 7 millions years ago, we have one or two fossils for each known species of human ancestor.</p>
<p>This is all to say that your question is *very* difficult to even guess at. Homo sapiens is generally considered to have existed for about 300,000 years, but it's probable that, given the opportunity and motivation, a modern person could produce offspring with a much older human ancestor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
