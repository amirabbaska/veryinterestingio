		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A better way to word this would be, &quot;Why <em>would</em> it be possible to imagine a hue that is completely outside one's experience, to the point where the neurological circuitry to process such a hue may not even exist?&quot;</p>
<p>Anything you can imagine or visualize is necessarily going to be informed by and at least in part based on things you've previously experienced. By the time a person is old enough to ask a question like &quot;Why can't I imagine a new color&quot; their brain has probably already been exposed to every possible color or combination of colors available to them (especially nowadays with such widespread and easy access to video games, television, and digital artistic tools like Photoshop and Paint Tool SAI) and has adjusted itself to recognize and process them.</p>
<p>You can't imagine a new color because there's nothing to build it from; it would necessarily have to be derived from a color you already know, or a combination of those colors. Where would you even start? It's as if someone asked you to build a house out of a brand new, never before seen material, but without using any currently known or even hypothetically possible substances or combination of substances whatsoever to create it. You'd need to invent new physics and chemistry before you could even begin.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to clarify that I don't necessarily think it is impossible for a person to <em>experience</em> a new color, either because they weren't exposed to it before, or because of drug use, injury, or some other phenomenon. What I don't think is possible is for a person to <em>purposefully imagine</em> a brand new color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you're a meditation master and have breached the deepest mysteries of the mind and imagined yourself a color never before seen by human eyes. Or you've dropped acid for the first time and you're lost in the 17th Celestial Realm being shown the wonders of the universe by Marley and Batman on a unicycle. In fact, you have only &quot;seen&quot; this new color with your mind's eye. How would you go about telling someone about it?</p>
<p>All you could really say for positive is that it's a new color. If asked to describe it, you could only say what it was not. &quot;It's not red... it's not blue... it's not white or black or the absence of color at all.&quot; If it were &quot;blueish&quot; or &quot;greenish&quot;, for example, it would just be some shade of blue or green. If you take away all the colors it's not, you have nothing else left. It's a limitation of the language; you can never even walk someone through your mental process to that color as nothing in nature has ever possessed it.</p>
<p>The best you could hope for is that this new color produced a strong emotional response in you or some other synesthesic experience. At least then you could say that the new color &quot;is like stepping on a vacuum cleaner in the dark, but you're worried it's actually a python&quot;. People will generally think you're a pretensions waste of time, but there'll be at least someone out there who think you're cool. If you say that the new color &quot;is the pure love felt for all living sentient beings in all temporal realms&quot; then people will definitely find you insufferable and think you're only bullshitting them because you want to sell your self-written book on success.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I don't think it's impossible to imagine a new color. It's a neat mental exercise that pairs well with doing nine impossible things before breakfast. Helpful for the budding artist. If you did succeed, I expect that it would define your artistic career trying to describe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Chimerical_colors" target="_blank">You can experience a new color</a>, but you can't imagine it because you don't know what you don't know. A &quot;new&quot; color would be one that couldn't be captured by the standard RGB palette, since (more or less) every imaginable color is some combination of those three primaries; you can imagine a particular shade of blue-green that you may never have actually seen because your brain is capable of summing known colors and traveling along the gradients. If you had seen one impossible color through some type of optical or neurological illusion, however, you might be able to imagine other colors of the same type. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: if every band of visible light is combined to form &quot;white&quot; light, what about when every band of light (gamma rays to long radio waves) is combined? Like, if you show each of those into a prism at appropriate angles for their wavelength, as opposed to scattering white light out of a prism to form a rainbow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
