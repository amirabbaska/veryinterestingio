<p>Examples: </p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure [that] Santa will bring whatever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think [that] we're ever going to escape this dungeon of sexual perversion? I'm not sure [that] I want to, personally.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the best blowjob [that] I've ever received.&quot;</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For people who are a bit more curious, here is an ELILinguisticsMajor answer:</p>
<p>The first two sentences are examples of sentences with complement clauses. A complement clause is basically a full sentence placed within a main sentence. The complement clause functions as a noun in the main sentence.</p>
<p>The last sentence is an example of a sentence with a relative clause. A relative clause is also a full sentence placed within a main sentence, but does not function like a noun; it modifies a noun in the main sentence.</p>
<p>In English, &quot;that&quot; is what is an example of a complementizer or a relativizer. It basically says, &quot;Hey! What comes after me is a complement clause or a relative clause!&quot;</p>
<p>Because English has a pretty strict word order (Subject-Verb-Object and relative clauses always follow the noun it modifies) it is not necessary to always include &quot;that&quot; in the main sentence as it is fairly obvious if there is a relative or complement clause and it is easy to tell what role (subject or object of the verb) the relativized noun (the noun modified by a relative clause) has in the relative clause.</p>
<p>Bonus:
Some languages don't even have a relativizer
Ex: Jacaltec from Guatemala
xwoche     kap                                                              camixe    xaloko
I like       (tells what class the noun is in, not important)  shirt        you bought
Translation: I like the shirt [that] you bought
(xaloko is the relative clause)</p>
<p>Kanuri from Nigeria
kam       kasuwulan           rukona      de       nongonyi
person   in the market       I saw        the      I don't know
Translation: I don't know the person [that] I saw in the market
(&quot;kasuwulan rukona&quot; is the relative clause)</p>
<p>*all credit for the examples goes to my professor this past semester</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to what everyone has said...</p>
<p>'That' has a variety of uses in English, it can be a determiner:
'That's my book'
An adverb:
'I couldn't keep my eyes open, I was that tired'
A pronoun:
'That's what I'm going to do now'</p>
<p>There are many more but it's 2am where I am right now...
'That' can also be used in a noun clause , which basically means that whatever comes after 'that' is completing the first clause of the sentence by acting as a noun, you see this a lot before words like 'think', 'know' or 'sure'. </p>
<p>Basically, try omitting 'that' from the first few examples? Doesn't work, but you can when you use 'that' in a noun clause. This is also why you can have sentences like 'I think that that's great', or 'I think that's great' but you can't have 'I think great'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It works because we understand what it means. It's much like the sentence 'Stop!',  in which the subject is 'you'. The subject is not actually included in the sentence what is understood. If memory serves, this is even called and implied subject. Your example works in the same way, relying on the understanding of The Listener or reader to fill in the Gap and make sense of the sentence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Languages evolve over time, and one of the most common forms of evolution is omitting things that are not required for the meaning. Consider this conversation:</p>
<p>A: Yo, anyone home?
B: Yeah, what about it?
A: Lookin' for Ted.
B: Haven't seen him.
A: Never?
B: Not since yesterday.</p>
<p>It's <em>so much easier</em> than the grammatically corrrect conversation:</p>
<p>A: Yo, is anyone home? B: Yeah, why do you care about it? A: I'm looking for Ted. B: I haven't seen him. A: Have you <em>never</em> seen him? B: I haven't seen him since yesterday.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I tried to remove it from my work as it seemed to make it flow better and be more concise. When I wrote my Master's thesis I ctr-f'd &quot;that&quot; and found over 120 of them. Removed almost all of them and it seemed to read a lot better. Most usage is redundant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
