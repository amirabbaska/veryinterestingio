To simplify the way it works, the device which is placed somewhere on the body where the skin is thin, in your case the finger, and it emits specific light wave lengths, and its sensors detects what waves are being absorbed through the blood, giving them a fairly accurate approximation of the oxygenation of your blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: While oximetry didn't come into common use until the 1980's, it's actually a much earlier invention...a physiologist named Millikan had an oximeter working in 1941. It used incandescent lamps instead of a laser, so it didn't have a lot of resolution, but it delivered useful data on pilot respiratory problems during WW2.</p>
<p>The Millikan instrument and its supporting electronics took up a whole wall of a lab, and you can see it in action in the 1942 film <em>Dive Bomber</em>, with Errol Flynn as a Navy flight surgeon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The tech is there and relatively easy and the (never used) patent expired in 2012.  They already do it on earlobes sometimes, so earlobe is the perfect place for it.  C'mon chinese manufacturers / kickstarter entrepreneurs!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Pulse oximetry does indeed measure blood oxygen concentration by measuring absorption of specific wavelengths of light. However, it is important to note that these devices actually measure the bound hemoglobin (Hb) inside red blood cells. This is typically fine, however CO (carbon monoxide) binds to Hb thousands of times more strongly than O2 (oxygen). For this reason people rescued from fires, and fire fighters working a blaze need their O2 testing preformed with special pulse oximeters that use an additional light source to detect CO bound Hb and subtract it from the percent of O2 bound Hb, in order to obtain the correct percentage of Oxygen in the blood.
Also of note is that since this is a percentage, it only determines relative O2 bound Hb, not absolute values. If you were anemic (or hypovolemic) with 100% O2 binding, you still might not be meeting your bodies oxygen demands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
