		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. By launching near the equator rather than the poles, you can get up to a 1,000 mph boost just from the earth's rotation. Additionally, you should launch to the <em>east</em> to get this benefit. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> In low earth orbit you need to be going 17,000 mph - it doesn't matter which direction. But at the equator the earth is rotating 1,000 mph counterclockwise, so if you launch east into a counterclockwise orbit you only need to gain 16,000 mph. If you launch to the west into a clockwise orbit you need to gain 18,000 mph. </p>
<p>By launching west, you're basically starting out with a 1,000 mph deficit that you have to overcome, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0AbkHXM.gif" target="_blank">like running the wrong way on a moving floor.</a> </p>
<p>In the US, this is why we launch missions from Florida - because it's pretty far south, and if you're launching to the east you're over ocean and not populated areas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Israel, doesn't have this advantage. They have to launch their <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/Shavit" target="_blank">Shavit</a> rockets (Hebrew for 'comet') to the west so that they pass over the Mediterranean, rather than potentially hostile neighbor states. This puts their satellites on &quot;retrograde orbits,&quot; meaning they orbit the earth opposite the direction of pretty much every other man-made satellite. While that may seem cool it comes at the expense of more fuel, limiting them to payloads 30% smaller than if they were launched eastward.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/VeryLittle has it mostly correct, but the answer is &quot;usually&quot;.  If you're trying to get into a retrograde orbit, you have to kill all that momentum.  It doesn't do much harm for polar orbit, but it doesn't help much either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually it does do harm for a polar orbit, because you still have to cancel out that eastwards velocity, or else you'll end up in an orbit that is not perfectly polar (90Â° inclanation). This is why polar launches are done from as <em>far</em> from the equator as possible (near the poles, such as Alaska or northern Russia), since the earth is spinning more slowly there because it's closer to the axis of rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The circumference of the Earth at the equator is much greater than near to the poles. This means you have more angular velocity at the equator, because it takes the same time to rotate 360 degrees at any point on Earth, but at the equator you're travelling a much greater distance in that time. Almost all launches take advantage of this effect, because the rocket needs a lower delta v (change in velocity). This means the rocket can carry a larger payload or use less fuel, therefore prograde launches are more efficient.
Retrograde launches actually have negative velocity relative to the direction of the orbit, so they not only lose out on the boost of the Earths' rotation, they actually have to burn extra fuel to counteract the Earth's rotation. A polar orbit doesn't get the boost of the Earth's rotation, but doesn't have to burn as much fuel counteracting Earth's rotation as a retrograde orbit.
A good ananlogy would be a hammer throw - someone with longer arms, rotating at the same frequency will throw an object further, so the hammer/rocket gets a bigger boost. (the person with long arms represents launching at the equator, and short arms is closer to the poles).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
