		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bad smell you are referring to comes from bacteria on the towel. Those bacteria thrive and reproduce more on a wet towel, than a dry towel. The more bacteria on the towel, the more it will smell. </p>
<p>So the difference is that a crumpled towel has less surface area exposed to the air, and therefore less water evaporating. Since there is more water, there is more bacteria, and hence more stank.</p>
<p>Edit: same goes with other clothes. The dryer a thing is, the less bacteria can thrive. Wrinkles allow moisture to stay longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mold and bacteria love wet places.</p>
<p>If a towel is wet, mold fungus and bacteria thrive. They stink.</p>
<p>Water need to escape through the air. Drying. The water trapped inside of the towel-ball, have no contact with the air and cannot escape. By hanging the towel up, The entire towel have direct contact with the air, making the water escape easily - drying faster. Less time wet, less mold, less bacteria, less smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its the speed of the drying. the faster the towel dries, the less likely it is for organisms to grow within the towel and create that musty, mildewy smell. When the towel is crumpled, the water doesn't leave as quickly and creates a nice, humid area for stinky organisms like bacteria and fungi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>worked with a guy that smelled bad enough people did not want to sit near him, and we all assumed it was lack of personal hygiene.  management finally talked to him, after months.  turned out he showered daily but his clothes smelled - he had a basement apt that was damp and his clothes never got completely dry after washing (i guess he didn't have a dryer).  anyway, he was made aware and find a way to fix it and it was never a problem again.  </p>
<p>it was unfortunate for him because he was a bit odd to begin with and the clothes smell problem set him further apart from others at work</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can give you an engineer's answer, not a biologist. When they're crumpled, it takes longer for them to dry out because there's less surface area than when they're hung, the greater the surface area to volume ratio, the quicker it'll dry. The prolonged dampness causes bacteria to proliferate faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
