		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small amount of diesel in the tank of a petrol engine is not a problem. The will preform  worse as it is harder to ignite. A large amount of diesel will result in fuel that the engine can't ignite so it will not work and you need to clean it. Normally no permanent damage is done but seals and injector might fail.</p>
<p>petrol in a diesel engine can destroy the engine. One part is that diesel lubricate but gas do not so fuelinjectors and pumps might fail. The next problem is the cylinder. A diesel engine compress the fule a lot more then a petrol engine.</p>
<p>Both diesel and petrol will ignite when compressed. Diesel will ignite when the pitons is at the top and start to move down. Petrol ignite at a lower pressure. So it will ignite before the piston reached the top and that can damage the engine</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In this case it’s a difference between <em>how</em> they burn/explode that makes a difference. In engines diesel explodes when you compress it far enough, but gasoline needs a spark to start the process off. If an engine is built one way and you try to run the other, at best your engine won’t work, and at worse your engine will be ruined forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is basically a light oil. Gasoline engines do not produce the right environment to burn it correctly - diesel requires high heat. So in a gasoline engine, the byproducts of combustion, soot, foul the spark plug, gum the valves and cylinder, and can cause the cylinder to misfire, fail to hold combustion pressure, or even spontaneously ignite if you have burning embers while you pump more fuel and air into the cylinder - which will burn all the way up the intake of the engine, causing backfire. If that spontaneous ignition happens inside the closed cylinder, then you will get odd shaped, or multiple pressure waves, which can occur at the wrong time -when there's nowhere for the pressure to go, or slap into each other, and either way, cause physical damage to the walls or piston. Diesel is also a low quality fuel, filled with contaminants, and the fuel system has to be designed with that in mind - otherwise, diesel clogs gasoline injectors.</p>
<p>Diesel is ignited by compression. Compress a gas, like air, and it gets hot. Try it with a bicycle pump - there's a reason it gets warm, and it's not from the pump parts rubbing inside. Diesel is stable and predictable, and will ignite under compression at the right time, every time. Gasoline, on the other hand, is unstable, and will ignite at the wrong time, every time, in a diesel engine. Then you get ping or knock like I described above inside the cylinder, and you cause physical damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>What would happen if you were baking a cake but instead of using eggs you used ground beef. They both have calories, right? They’re both animal products with protein and fat? So it should still make a cake?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
