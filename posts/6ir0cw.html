<p>Also what do you count as coastline, is London on the coast because the river is tidal there, and if not, how long low does the sea need to be for Dover to be considered &quot;not on the coast&quot; but on a big arse river (as it has been historically)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting problem. Since the length of possible coastline can be specified within an interval where both left and right endpoints have the same value (zero) we can apply Rolles theorem (also the interval is defined as continous, f'(x) exists, etc..). This tells us that there is at least one point on the interval where the length of coastline is maximized. </p>
<p>So we know there is definitly at least one solution.</p>
<p>But I have no idea how to find it..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that the coastlines of landmasses if they were submerged to different depths would have similar fractal dimension (basically if they were equivalently crinkly), then you would maximise the coastline when the earth's surface was half land, half water (meaning we'd have to subtract water from the current arrangement).</p>
<p>But this assumption is probably not good because processes of erosion near the current surface of the water make the current coastline longer than it &quot;should&quot; be (essentially it is more crinkly because of the effects of variable water level, waves and wind). If you use a long enough ruler to measure coastlines, this effect would become negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average sea level is around 3700 meters above the sea floor.
The sea floor is (for this purpose) flat, so the continents are essentially like huge mesas on the sea floor.
This means we can reduce the sea level and get more and more coastline as we go.
Until we get to the point where sea floor topography starts to affect coastline length.
Looking at maps it seems that we can go down to around 2500 meters below sea level before we have to start doing a more detailed analysis.
So maximum coastline will occur somewhere under (3700 - 2500) = 1200 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to go out on a limb here, as assume maximum coastline approximately correlates to maximum land exposure in proportion to depth below current sea level; therefore, lowering the sea level to the bottom of the continental shelf (150 m, 490 ft), but no further is my conjecture for producing maximum coastline.</p>
