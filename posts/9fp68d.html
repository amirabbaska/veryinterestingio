		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring air resistance and assuming the earth is a homogenous sphere,</p>
<p>The force F acting on the ball while within the earth is described by:</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> = -GMm/R^(3)<strong>r</strong> where r is the distance from the centre of the earth to the ball. </p>
<p>For those that have studied springs, this equation is of the form:</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> = -k<strong>r</strong> where k = GMm/R^(3)</p>
<p>Or equivalently:</p>
<p><strong>a</strong> = -ω^(2)<strong>r</strong> where ω^2 = k/m = GM/R^3</p>
<p>ω is the angular frequency of such a system, and is also given by ω = 2π/T where T is the period of oscillation. </p>
<p>Given those equations, we can calculate T to be:</p>
<p>T = 2π(R^(3)/GM)^(1/2) ~= 84 minutes. </p>
<p>That's the time it takes to fall right through the earth and come back to its starting position. Coincidentally, that's also the time it takes to make a full orbit at the surface of the earth (it's not exactly a coincidence, since simple harmonic motion along one axis is simply circular motion projected onto that axis).</p>
<p>Since there is no air resistance, the ball will fall right through to the other side, reverse direction, then fall back to its starting point indefinitely in simple harmonic motion. </p>
<p>If there is air resistance, the amplitude of this oscillation will decay exponentially and eventually the ball will come to a rest at the centre of the earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprise answer: if there is air in the pipe, the ball will not make it to the center of the Earth because at some point (probably in the mantle) it will float on the increasingly dense air in the pipe! The air will not just provide resistance; it will provide buoyancy as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First, our assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The air in the pipe is open to the free atmosphere and is therefore at 1 bar at sea level, and follows the ideal gas law at the depths that we're looking at.</li>
<li>The pipe is strong enough to withstand the crushing pressures of the deep Earth (which will be higher than the air pressure, at least in the depths we're looking at).</li>
<li>The air in the pipe is somewhere between atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the rock right next to it. Let's be generous and say that the air is at the temperature of the rock. Most importantly, the air can't be way, way hotter than the surrounding rock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like ordinary holes in the ground like mines or caves, air pressure will increase exponentially the farther down you go according to p = 101 kPa * e^(z/H), where z is the depth and H is the &quot;scale height&quot; of the atmosphere. H is proportional to absolute temperature (H = R_air*T/g); in the atmosphere H is around 8 km, but in the mantle T might be around 2500 K, so H would be around 73 km. <em>(R_air is the gas constant for air that shows up in the ideal gas law, about 287 J/(kg*K).)</em> Let's be generous and assume H = 73 km everywhere. g, the gravitational acceleration, varies with depth within the Earth, but we're looking at relatively shallow depths (around 10%) so let's assume g is constant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, p = 101 kPa * e\^(z/70 km), and from the ideal gas law, <em>density</em> <em>= p/(R_air*T)</em> = 101 kPa/(R_air * 2500 K) * e^(z/70 km)= 0.14 kg/m^(3) * e^(z/70 km). This means that the air becomes denser than a baseball (\~650 kg/m^(3)) around 600 km depth, and denser than a bowling ball (\~1300 kg/m^(3)) around 650 km depth (for reference, the outer core is at about 2900 km and the center of the Earth is at \~6370 km) (which quite shallow in the mantle). At this depth, the ball will be of neutral buoyancy; it will sink a little beyond that depth due to its momentum but then rebound to its equilibrium position, just like a piece of wood tossed into a pond.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you somehow managed to keep the air temperature at a normal surface temperature (say, 17 deg C), the air would be way denser all the way down the pipe and the ball would start floating between 50-60 km depth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we really want to dig into this question (pun absolutely intended) more than other answers, we need to start thinking about how and why this pipe exists. The pressure on the pipe would be extreme, not to mention it would have to survive the heat of Earth's core. If the pipe conducts heat, the air in the tunnel would get extremely warm and flow outwards while at the same time cold air would try to get in. Would we get a wind blowing in a single direction (say from north to south) or would wind fly in two &quot;lanes&quot;? Probably depends on the size of the tunnel, but I'm not too familiar with the physics here.</p>
<p>Another question I have is, depending on the width of the pipe, a large amount of air would go into the tunnel, reducing the amount of air in the atmosphere. Would this have a noticeable effect if for example the pipe was 1 m in diameter?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
