		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The NYSE started all the way back in the 18th century, and the Nasdaq only started up in the 1970s. The Nasdaq was originally just for information purposes, and only later became a stock exchange. Because of this, the Nasdaq is where more cutting-edge companies chose to list themselves, while old stalwarts still join the NYSE.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to already be some good answers here, but if you need more and have Netflix, there’s a series called ‘Explained,’ and the stock market episode (which is only like 15 minutes long, so it’s not a huge commitment) is easy to follow, goes into this, and may be helpful if you’re a more visual learner! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your company has to do $5 million annually to be listed on the Nasdaq. Your company has to do $50 million annually to be listed on the NYSE. That's why it's called the &quot;Big Board&quot;. Also, Nasdaq lists companies in &quot;North America&quot;, thereby allowing Canadian companies to be listed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The New York Stock Exchange is the oldest and largest exchange in America used to buy and sell stock. The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations has only been around for roughly 50 years and has grown to be the second largest exchange in the US by introducing a level of technology that was not previously Incorporated in stock trading at the time, namely the ability to process trades electronically, get the most up-to-date quotes on stock prices, and minimize the gap between the bid and ask prices (this didn't go over well with brokerage firms who depended on a larger spread for their commissions but obviously investors liked this change).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
