When you're exercising and burning fat and all that, does your body take energy from around the areas being worked or is it taken evenly from all over your body? A really simple way of stating it I guess is if I work out 1 leg and only 1 leg will I have 1 skinny leg or will it take it burn fat evenly throughout my body.</p>
<p>Edit: for those conversations below, I misspoke. My goal isn't to lose weight. It's simply to get stronger. Thank you all for your well thought out responses and advice! Pour out some liquor for my inbox.</p>
<p>Edit: ignoring everyone who can't shut up about how much I can't leg press.</p></div></div>

<p>Significant spot reduction of fat isn't a thing.</p>
<p>There was a 2007 study by University of Connecticut that had people exercise one arm for 12 weeks and measured the fat on both arms before and after the 12 weeks, and showed the fat loss was general over the body. There was also a 1971 study that looked at tennis players (who use one arm a lot more than the other) that found both arms had similar thicknesses of fat.</p>
<p>There has been another study from 2007 that suggest a slight link between heavier exercise and minimal spot reduction, but I haven't read that paper or seen it reported in a scientific magazine so I don't have much confidence in that study as evidence spot reduction works.</p>

<p>More often than not, a 30-year old is bigger than a 20-year old because they've been lifting longer. Simple as that. Even working as a certified personal trainer for years it took me a loooong time to be patient with my results. Stay consistent and think in terms of months, not weeks or days when it comes to your results. In pure strength AND in the mirror.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of really good answers and this will probably end up buried, but for the couple of redditors that do read this. </p>
<p>The geist of everything that's been written is, don't bother with spot reduction, your body loses fast all around at the same time. This is a good enough ELI5.</p>
<p>Bringing the explanation up a notch.</p>
<p>When fat it's first stored, it will go to specific parts of your body first. This will depend on 2 things: Your DNA and your Sex Hormones at that moment.</p>
<p>This makes it possible, for example, if a man gains fat at a period when his estrogen is high ( puberty, environmental factor, medication, disease, etc ) he can put fat in places where woman usually put on fat, on the hips, ass and breast areas.  </p>
<p>A general tendency it's that male sex Hormones creates a tendency towards belly fat and female sex Hormones creates a tendency towards hips, ass and breast. Low on both gives more tendency for evenly distributed fat all around including arms and chin.</p>
<p>Now knowing that there is an order in which your body puts on fat, there is also an order in which the body metabolises the fat. This is the reverse of when you put on.</p>
<p>So here's a practical example.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a man put on some fat when he is 13 years old and got fat is his breast area, because his estrogen was high during puberty. Then at 22 he put on more fat on his belly. </p>
<p>At 25 he wants to lose the fat is his breast because he is self conscious about it. Doing chest exercise will not help. For him to lose the fat in his breast he will have to first lose the fat in his belly and only then he will lose it in his breast.</p>
<p>The order is Last fat In First fat Out ( LIFO ).</p>
<p>Of course keep in mind that rarely does the body put on fat in just one spot, usually it puts on in one place more than all the rest, but we are keeping it simple for the sake of the explanation.</p>
<p>As far as we know right now, there is no way to change the order in which we lose fat. We also don't know how the body identifies which fat cells put on fat last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are either in anabolic state or catabolic state.  That is to say, your body is absorbing and or storing what you just ate OR you are catabolic and your body is taking from its stores.</p>
<p>These two states are regulated by little messengers in your body called hormones. Certain ones tell fat cells to release energy, others tell them to store. </p>
<p>Thing is, those hormones are released in the blood stream and travel all over the body. You can't really pick and choose where they go.</p>
<p>When you are anabolic, those hormones tell fat cells &quot;hey bro, we have more energy floating around than we need, store this up for later.&quot;</p>
<p>When you are catabolic, those hormones say &quot;hey we need more energy, hook us up fat cells.&quot;</p>
<p>This is also why it's hard to gain lean muscle but not fat. You have to be anabolic, your muscle cells need to be all like &quot;we are swole bro, we need protein.&quot;</p>
<p>So your anabolic hormones will be running around storing up anything, proteins in muscle cells AND energy in fat cells. </p>
<p>It becomes a tricky but not impossible line to walk.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood circulates everywhere all at once, only definitely passing through the heart and lungs in a particular order (edit: and the gut to the liver). Different areas of fat can have different quantities of receptors for different hormones. Some cells are more sensitive to testosterone or estrogen or cortisol or insulin or adrenalin or whatnot than others. This is why your ass gets fat but your forehead doesn't. Which receptors go where is determined by both genetics and environment/lifestyle.</p>
<p>How fat you get is determined by how many excess calories you eat. How many excess calories you eat is determined by your hunger. Your hunger is determined by a lot of things, but the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which turn off and on hunger, respectively, are the big two. Leptin sensitivity seems to be closely related to insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity seems to be closely related to viceral fat, particularly liver fat. Liver fat is mostly a function of fructose and polyunsaturated fats, but alcohol contributes, too. The fructose and alcohol because they're processed there, the fat because unsaturated fats are unstable and oxidize readily and the liver holds on to those rancid fats until it can decontaminate them, which it's not that great at.</p>
<p>It gets more complicated from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
