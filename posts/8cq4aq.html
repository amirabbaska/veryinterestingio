		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your muscles aren't &quot;whole&quot; - they're made of individual fibers that run in parallel. A simple muscular contraction, such as bending your arm, actually requires the precise coordination of countless muscle fibers. And for each muscle there are many distinct neurons, each of which controls multiple clumps of muscle fibers within a muscle.</p>
<p>Muscle memory is practicing a specific motion so frequently and/or with so much conscious effort that the proper chain of neuronal firing to achieve the exact desired movement is essentially automatic.</p>
<p>It's not all that different from writing a computer script to execute a bunch of commands in a perfectly timed order rather than doing it all manually and perhaps forgetting an operator or pressing a button late.</p>
<p>Edit: this is very ELI5. Try /r/askscience for a better answer from someone more qualified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are implicit or procedural memories, and explicit or declarative memories.</p>
<p>As the name implies, declarative memories are memories that you need to recall with conscious effort. These are &quot;stored&quot; in your brain, it's just you need to consciously allow the correct sequence of neurons to fire for you to be able to recall. These kinds of memories are always about facts or events, something vocally tangible.</p>
<p>Implicit, or procedural memories however, are stored in automatic sensorimotor neurons. These memories are types of behaviors or actions that you've repeated so many times, that when a situation comes for you to perform them, the neurons fire unconsciously. This is not to say that you will start trying to ride a bike unbeknownst to your consciousness randomly. It'll happen with you trying to, but the actual action will not require you to take into account about how to balance yourself, or how to make sure each foot presses down on the pedal at the right time.</p>
<p>Your muscles don't store these memories, your brain does. Not having to think about how to walk or run is important because having a consciousness means we are curious beings with the ability to create and recall memories at will. So when you need to walk and reconsider your life choices, your brain has come prepared to make sure none of your conscious thinking needs to waste time figuring out how to walk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually done in the brain not the muscles. This is called the procedural action selection system. Essentially, you practice an action or action chain so many times that it can all be released at once. From then, releasing that action chain is just a matter of situation recognition.
As far as where the learning is done/is stored the action chain itself is likely stored in parts in the cerebellum and motor cortex and the coordination and release of it heavily involves the basal ganglia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter took ballet through high school, and I was always amazed at how she could perform routines so perfectly. I asked her about this once and her reply was that she practices enough so that there is no thinking about what comes next. I wasn’t convinced, but I have been doing a 21 form tai chi for about five years. I experience “watching myself” go through the sequence without conciously directing my movements. It is a very odd phenomenon, I sometimes have the distinct feeling of not knowing the next step, but I just keep moving and that seems to generate the next move. It is a hackneyed term but “flow” is what comes to mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of muscle memory:</p>
<p>One is something that most people think of: you train some fine motor skill up (say, playing an instrument) and you eventually can just do it without thinking about it.</p>
<p>This isn't actually something that's stored in your muscles, but really just something that you've done so often that you don't have to actually think about it (think walking, for another example); it's stored like any other memory, through connections in your brain.</p>
<p>Then there is the bodybuilding type that is an actual muscle phenomenon: that someone who used to have muscle but has fallen off of training will get back to where they used to be much easier than someone who has never been that fit before. </p>
<p>This has to do with how difficult it is to actually create new muscle cells for your body, so it is very reluctant to actually reduce the cell count unless it absolutely has to. So when your muscles get smaller, what typically happens is that each cell in your muscle tissue gets smaller, and this usually coincides with an increase in body fat so the muscle gets hidden.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
