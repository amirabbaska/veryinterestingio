		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were a few options.</p>
<p>Foraging what they could find was common for armies that were traveling and not really near settlements</p>
<p>Raiding conquered settlements was always a popular one.  They had enough food to feed their army(who is now dead) so they've got enough food to feed you!</p>
<p>Buying from surrounding settlements.  Farmers would generally stock up in good years to help get through bad years, they might take some of what they made to a nearby city to sell for gold to get other things they needed.  Instead of them going to a city, an army representative would stop by, buy their granary, then cart it back to the army</p>
<p>Central supply.  Rome fed a lot of people from Sardinia, and later Egypt.  They would ship food from Sardinia to Legions stationed in Gaul and Italy, maintaining this supply line was critical to the survival of the legions</p>
<p>Big ass wagon trains were a common occurrence and problem.  Some came from the farming villages, some were sent from the homeland, but all were great targets!  When an army moved it could have a wagon train a few miles long following it, this was very slow and very vulnerable.  If the supply line could be cut while an army was in hostile and barren territory they were doomed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did a whole lot of foraging. Armies generally didn't travel in one mass, because they'd be impossible to feed. They spread out across the countryside and bought, begged, or robbed what they needed. Soldiers were largely expected to provide for themselves. Armies generally only amassed in one place to fight a battle. This is why catching your enemy &quot;on the march&quot; was such a tactical feat. If you could smash your massed forces into their spread and disorganized forces they'd be crushed.</p>
<p>Armies were often followed by a horde of camp followers that was sometimes as large or larger than the army. Families, traders, prostitutes, lenders, gamblers, you name it. They trailed the army along the baggage train and formed a sort of pre-modern logistics network.</p>
<p>Generally though armies moved around a lot, simply because if they stayed put too long they'd starve. It was common to suffer more casualties from malnourishment and disease than from the enemy right up until the 20th century.</p>
<p>Pre-modern armies were not a popular sight. They were like a swarm of heavily armed locusts. There are records in Europe of towns and cities simply bribing nominally friendly armies and mercenary companies to keep moving rather than stop because they were so much trouble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were three basic ways of doing this: keep up a supply train, forage, or take it from the local population.</p>
<p>Armies of well-organized states often had supply trains providing food. For example, during Roman times governors were often required to send food and other supplies to an army's operational base. From there, it could be sent out to smaller forward bases and soldiers would go on missions from there. This is a very basic overview since the actual details could change depending on the exact period and campaign.</p>
<p>Armies could also forage on the move. This would be less likely when actually at war and trying to get somewhere quickly and likely couldn't sustain an army on its own, but troops could always supplement with what the found/hunted.</p>
<p>Armies would also often take food from the local population after intimidating or murdering them. Most people lived on farms in the countryside and not in walled settlements, so they would have had little protection. This would usually happen in enemy territory, but not always. </p>
<p>The latter two methods were more common since most ancient states weren't organized enough to keep steady supply trains running. You also have to keep on the move to make those two methods work, which is one reason standing armies or large dedicated garrisons were rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
