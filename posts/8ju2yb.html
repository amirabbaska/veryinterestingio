<p>Some of it's state land, so I hiked out there to see what it was. There's no trails (new or old distinguishable) to any of these. They're a section of land, about 300-400 feet round, with...20-30 feet of water, like a moat, around it. There's no markings or telling of equipment that I could see that made these. I've asked people who know about the CCC, local historians, soil testing people, and a few logging gurus, and none of them can tell me what it is.</p>
<p>As best as I can tell, the trees are 70-135 years old on these patches of land.</p>
<p>Here's a picture from Imgur <a href="https://imgur.com/a/aRt3C0N" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/aRt3C0N</a></p>
<p>And I found it originally from here: <a href="https://www.tuscolacounty.org/gis/" target="_blank">https://www.tuscolacounty.org/gis/</a></p>
<p>You can see a view on Google Maps, but it must have to do with leaves covering it or what not. On the GIS map, there's 20+ of these.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering the location, I would suspect they are collapsed pingos from the era when the land was tundra at the end of the last glacial era. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingo" target="_blank">Pingos</a> are hills that rise in permafrost zones when a pocket of underground water freezes and heaves the land up in to a small conic shaped hill. If/when the area warms, the ice melts and the hill subsides into small round ponds (illustration of one in the netherlands is shown in the wiki link above)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool question! I see few commenters are trying to explain why the &quot;bullseye&quot; feature occurs. Say you want to build a mound, maybe because you want a dry platform above the swamp, maybe for spiritual reasons, maybe because you just think mounds are cool. What's the easiest way to build that mound? Simple- go around the mound site in a circle, digging up dirt and shoveling it into the center. When you're done, you have a raised area in the center with a depressed ring all around the outside. Since the water table is so close to the surface here, that ring floods and becomes a moat.</p>
<p>Although I think it's most likely that humans were the &quot;mound builders&quot; in this instance, other animals are responsible for a similar phenomenon. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mima_mounds" target="_blank">Mima mounds</a> are (much smaller) mounds created by prairie dogs or other burrowers when the water table is close to the surface. Unlike /u/shiningPate 's suggested pingos, a single mima mound shares the ring moat feature from your picture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably from native americans before michigan was settled by Europeans.</p>
<p>Michigan used to be covered in earthworks made by the native americans.  Much of these earthworks have been obliterated by farming/development.  It looks like this area hasn't because it is too swampy.  </p>
<p>Here's an old, but very detailed, book describing Native American artifacts and earthworks in Michigan, &quot;Primitive Man in Michigan&quot;
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015015368973;view=1up;seq=7" target="_blank">https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015015368973;view=1up;seq=7</a></p>
<p>Here's an image from that book <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qODkanR" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/qODkanR</a> it shows the number of authenticated mounds in each county.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I just noticed there are petroglyphs over in Sanilac.  That's like 30 miles down the Cass river.  Native americans were in the area for thousands of years, it's not surprising some signs are left after a few hundred years of the white people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
