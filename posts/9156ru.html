		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think in terms of photons.</p>
<p>To see a dinosaur light would have to reflect off of that dinosaur and travel to your telescope. Light spreads out, so the further away you are, the fewer photons will reach you.</p>
<p>At 60 million light years away the number of photons reaching you from that particular dinosaur are basically zero. If the dinosaur were very well lit, and didn't move, and the earth didn't move, and you took a photo over several millenia, it would still be a very dark picture. </p>
<p>Although then you'd have worry about other light sources (like stars and galaxies in the way), space dust, and the fact your telescope would need to be the size of a galaxy to bring the dinosaur into focus.</p>
<p>So I'm going with... No. Not really possible, even with a big telescope (and a well behaved dinosaur). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Not even theoretically. </p>
<p>Ever wondered why the telescopes they use to see far away objects are the size of an actual building? You need to capture enough light, and focus it to see something. </p>
<p>The further away you want to look, the bigger lens you need.</p>
<p>Here's a formula:</p>
<p><code>Earth Radius/Distance = 1.22 × Wavelength / Lens Diameter</code></p>
<p>Trex was greenish (at least in cartoons), so lets use the wavelength of green - about 500nm.</p>
<p>To see earth from 66 million years away, your lens needs a diameter of 6*10^10 meters. That's 6 with 10 zeroes, or about 1/3 of the way to the sun - imagine that, a lens so big, light needs 3 minutes just to get from one end to the other. </p>
<p>And this wouldnt show you any dinosaurs - you would only see earth as a speck of dust. Dinosaurs are, on average, smaller than the Earth. To see a dinosaur, replace earth's radius with the size of a dinosaur; lets just assume 10 meters. That gives you a <strong>lens size of about 4 light years in diameter</strong> - the distance between sun and the closest other star. If at this point your lens doesnt turn into a black hole (which it will), you would see a very confused looking dino.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If we were 66 million light years away from earth and had the technology to see earth clearly, what would we witness on earth? Would it be present day time or would we see dinosaurs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is, light spreads as it travels. You can test this yourself with a flashlight; shine it on something very close and it creates a small circle of light, but aim it at the other side of the room and it spreads into a much bigger circle.<br />
The same thing happens on a cosmic scale.<br />
Hypothetically, you could capture all of the photons that were emitted from a dinosaur, but you would need a telescope of galactic proportions to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the comments are saying you'd need a super good telescope, but in theory you're correct. The light would have been traveling for 66 million years to get to that point. It's also kinda funny to think that if the sun randomly blew up we would have no way of knowing for 9 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
