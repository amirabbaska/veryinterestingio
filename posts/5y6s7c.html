<p><a href="http://web.williams.edu/Astronomy/IAU_eclipses/eye_pressure.html" target="_blank"><strong>DO NOT PUT PRESSURE ON YOUR EYES</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most are familiar with closing the eye lids and pressing on the eye to see 'phosphenes', the constructs of our cortex in response to signals from the retina, but stimulated by pressure not light. Such pressure, if from a blow to the head, produces the 'seeing stars' effect commonly referred to. However, it is not recommended that this be done often or with any significant pressure. <strong><strong>Clearly applying sustained pressure on the eye is the same as the risk from Glaucoma, and often an exterior pressure is greatly in excess of that which might be internally generated. Non repairable damage is likely to result from any significant increase of pressure on the eye.</strong></strong> The rate of damage and extent of vision loss will be governed by eye health and age for the most part. When young the eye is resilient and pressures are absorbed more easily in other structures. With age tissues become more rigid, there is less natural protection, and the risk is increased.</p>
<p><strong>It is for these reasons that any situation that brings pressure on the eye, especially for extended periods, be avoided.</strong> </p>

<p>What's happening is that there is fluid in your eye. Increasing pressure on these fluids triggers your rods and cones in the back of the eye to send signals back to your brain, randomly. The fuzziness you see is random noise.</p>
<p>The pressure triggers channels that are usually triggered by light energy, and act like little gates turning on and off when they encounter certain types of light. Enough pressure overwhelms these gates, and causes them to &quot;break open&quot; creating fuzziness. The reason you don't see pure white is because each rod and cone needs time to &quot;reset&quot; before it can send another message. So instead of seeing pure white, you see white and black fuzzy dots. </p>
<p>Your brain likes patterns, though, and it's always looking for patterns in anything you see (trying to find edges, shapes, etc, so you can understand what you're seeing) </p>
<p>So when the brain sees random &quot;static&quot; noise, it starts to find shapes in it. Like, if I threw a bunch of marbles onto the ground, I bet you could start connecting dots and making shapes out of them.</p>
<p>So that's why you see geometric patterns and images, out of random static fuzz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not sure if that contributed to what I have now but it sure was fun seeing those colorful shapes and cloudy things when I press my eyes. </p>
