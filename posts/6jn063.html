		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't <em>want</em> to go without food, and unlike animals that comfortably go long periods of time without eating (like reptiles), going without food is merely possible, not normal.  Your body starts to show signs of not having eaten way before it completely kills you.  So that's your body telling you &quot;I'd really rather be eating right now: if you can find food, you should.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so to the amount of energy we use as a species, specifically our super intelligent brains are the core reason. Feeding that intelligence requires upwards of 20 percent of the total energy used by our bodies per day. As you can imagine, some other mammals do not feed this same requirement. It's best to imagine your brain as a raging campfire, and as soon as you toss a log on the fire, you get more heat, but it burns quickly due to the amount of heat it's producing.....so you toss another log on the fire. You could have a small smoldering fire of only coals that would last you days, but it wouldn't provide you with very much warmth.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if hunter gatherers feel hunger like modern humans do and actually are able to go much longer without even wanting to eat. Maybe discomfort is just from an addiction that stems from regular meals?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think of it in terms of a warning system akin to pain. When we get hurt, our body warns us through pain that something is wrong and that we should maybe address it. Pain isn't a useless reaction that we should wish away if we could. </p>
<p>Similarly, hunger is a warning from the body that it might be a good idea to eat something. Last thing you would want is to compromise your ability to think when trying to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a complete answer but I just want to note that if you talk to people who have undergone long term fasts or who practice intermittent fasting, the hunger is supposed to largely disappear after a period of acclimation. ~2 days for a full on no energy giving foods fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
