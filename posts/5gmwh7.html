		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lawyer here:</p>
<p>People often cite the First Amendment with the understanding that it gives you carte blanche to say 1) whatever you want 2) in any situation 3) without consequence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>In fact, you very much want certain types of speech to be forbidden.  Good examples include &quot;fighting words&quot; (intended to incite an immediate breach of the peace), obscenity, and child pornography.  What you have to understand in those examples is that &quot;speech&quot; in the context of the First Amendment more closely resembles the plain English definition of &quot;expression&quot;.</p>
<p>Protest is an enumerated right of &quot;expression&quot; for citizens, but you will notice that it is almost always preceded by the adjective &quot;peaceful&quot;.  By the very nature of protest generally, participants can very quickly enter the realm of hate speech or fighting words which, if not suppressed quickly, can lead to injury or loss of life.  No matter the protestors' declared intentions or the messages they wish to convey, this threat is very real.  Therefore, governments will often confine and monitor protests to prevent escalation, sometimes going so far as to forbid anything that isn't scheduled, approved, or confined.  Spontaneous protests often lead to arrests of the participants, who will cite the First Amendment as their shield.  They can expect little traction on such a legal defense since public safety is deemed paramount to unfettered expression of one's thoughts/emotions.  And rightfully so, if I may editorialize.</p>
<p>EDIT: Removed &quot;hate speech&quot; from examples of First Amendment exceptions.  Added obscenity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freedom of speech merely means you can't be persecuted based on speaking your opinions.  However, you are still obligated to follow the many other laws there are. </p>
<p>A designated protest area is merely meant to give you a place where you can practice your free speech without causing other disturbances.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to protest, but you do it in the middle of a major highway, you are breaking the law and causing potential public safety issues.  You won't be arrested for your speech, but you will be arrested for your acts.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that certain types of things are illegal and they involve speech.  You cannot hide behind the first amendment in those situations.  (i.e. you can't goto a bank and say, 'gimme all your money or I'll shoot you' and claim that you have the right to do so because of freedom of speech, regardless of whether you intend to follow through or not).</p>
<p>What freedom of speech does protect you from is things like going on the internet and posting on twitter saying &quot;our president is a complete douchebag and a liar.&quot;  This is something you can get arrested for in certain countries that don't give you this protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a hotly debated legal argument.  The justification is for keeping the peace or public safety, which is another requirement of government.</p>
<p>Under Bush, the idea of &quot;free speech zones&quot; was expanded and there are many allegations that protesters are given less access than supporters.  This is obviously problematic because if you are going to have zones you have to be consistent.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obama took it even further in 2012 when he signed a bill that granted the Secret Service to restrict speech and even make arrests of people exercising their freedom of speech rights.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen several answers about why you want some speech to be disallowed, but nothing specifically about why &quot;protest areas&quot; work under the Constitution.</p>
<p>The ELI5 answer is that the Supreme Court has said that while the government can't restrict the <em>content</em> of your speech, they're allowed to make reasonable restrictions to the <em>time, place, and manner</em> of that speech when there is a good reason to do so.</p>
<p>So the designated protest areas are allowed because they don't force you to change what you're going to say; they just make sure that you aren't being too disruptive or unsafe when you're saying it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see lots of comments about the US, but I know here there is mostly the requirement to notify the council about your protest beforehand primarily to avoid six different groups all trying to do a protest in the same place (yes this happened in the past). Also, if two groups who are known to start fighting when they see each other it better if they are far away from each other, and make sure the police know about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
