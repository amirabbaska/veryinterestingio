		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prof. Dr. Max Welling is a research chair in Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam and a VP Technologies at Qualcomm. He has a secondary appointment as a senior fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). He is co-founder of &quot;Scyfer BV&quot; a university spin-off in deep learning which got acquired by Qualcomm in summer 2017. In the past he held postdoctoral positions at Caltech ('98-'00), UCL ('00-'01) and the U. Toronto ('01-'03). He received his PhD in '98 under supervision of Nobel laureate Prof. G. 't Hooft. Max Welling has served as associate editor in chief of IEEE TPAMI from 2011-2015 (impact factor 4.8). He serves on the board of the NIPS foundation since 2015 (the largest conference in machine learning) and has been program chair and general chair of NIPS in 2013 and 2014 respectively. He was also program chair of AISTATS in 2009 and ECCV in 2016 and general chair of MIDL 2018. He has served on the editorial boards of JMLR and JML and was an associate editor for Neurocomputing, JCGS and TPAMI. He received multiple grants from Google, Facebook, Yahoo, NSF, NIH, NWO and ONR-MURI among which an NSF career grant in 2005. He is recipient of the ECCV Koenderink Prize in 2010. Welling is in the board of the Data Science Research Center in Amsterdam, he directs the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLAB), and co-directs the Qualcomm-UvA deep learning lab (QUVA) and the Bosch-UvA Deep Learning lab (DELTA). </p>
<p>He will be with us at 12:30 ET (ET, 17:30 UT) to answer your questions!</p></div></div>

What is your reaction to a comment by Noam Chomsky that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Artificial Intelligence] is doing very little from a scientific point of view. It is achieving things from an engineering point of view. Which is OK -- nobody should be opposed to bigger bulldozers if they work. But we shouldn't be misled about the insight it is supposed to be providing into the nature of intelligence.</p>

<p>What is your opinion on adversarial attacks? Comments: your group has been doing many research in Bayesian machine learning. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08244.pdf" target="_blank">Early results</a> show that adversarial attacks are less successful for neural nets learned with Bayesian inference. Can you comment?</p>
</li>
<li>Favorite learning algorithm for neural networks: variational inference or MCMC? You are known for comparing VI/MCMC to the bias/variance trade-off. MCMC: low bias, high variance; VI: low variance, high bias. What do you view as the benefit of being unbiased? It seems that neural networks have millions of parameters and the model does not resemble a physical process at all, so what value would we get from being unbiased?</li>
