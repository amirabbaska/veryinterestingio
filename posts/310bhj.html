		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi /u/TheKertMA,</p>
<p>There are many confusing answers to this question, mostly because people are conflating two separate things.</p>
<p>There is MWI, or the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" target="_blank">many-worlds interpretation</a>&quot; of quantum mechanics. This interpretation is favored by some physicists because it purportedly avoids the clunkiness of &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" target="_blank">wavefunction collapse</a>,&quot; a postulate of quantum mechanics many physicists consider unnecessary (or downright wrong). At this point, there is no empirical reason for preferring this interpretation of quantum mechanics over the assortment of other interpretations. The motivations are mostly philosophical (but that doesn't make them <em>bad</em>). For transparency, I find wavefunction collapse to be a contrivance. It's mostly a way of saying &quot;we don't know what happens, but it looks like this.&quot; I think more deterministic theories, such as MWI, or ensemble interpretations, or decoherence, are more appealing and self-consistent. But many people will disagree with me.</p>
<p>There is also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse" target="_blank">multiverse</a> theory, which is motivated entirely separately from MWI. The multiverse theory is seen as a consequence of theories like eternal inflation and/or string theory. We have many good reasons to believe inflation is true, such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_%28cosmology%29#Observational_status" target="_blank">near-scale invariant power spectrum</a>. However, we don't know which theory of inflation is an accurate description of what happened in the early universe (and in fact we don't <em>really</em> know if inflation is what happened at all), and we certainly don't know if string theory is true. However, as we obtain evidence at higher energy scales, we'll be able to get a better handle on which theories of inflation/string theory are consistent with the data, and we could <em>in principle</em> corroborate models of inflation/string theory that predict a multiverse. In practice, it's going to be very difficult.</p>
<p>To reiterate: MWI and the multiverse are motivated differently. Perhaps they can be made to agree, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1105/1105.3796v1.pdf" target="_blank">attempts by folks like Leonard Susskind</a> have been made (with dubious success). But the abstract alone is enough to illustrate that, if you don't believe some random /r/askscience panelist, you can trust that Leonard Susskind appreciates that these two things are not necessarily identical <em>a priori</em>: &quot;We argue that the many-worlds of quantum mechanics and the many
worlds of the multiverse are the same thing...&quot;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is intended to explain some of the weird effects of quantum mechanics, most famously, the results of double-slit experiment. In the quantum version of this experiment, a single photon of light was sent at two slits and the scientists did not observe which slit it went through. After several photons were sent through one at a time, the scientists expected to see a projection of the slits on a screen behind the slits. However, they instead saw an interference pattern, the same that appears if many photons are sent through the slits together.</p>
<p>Multiverse theory is one of two major proposed explanations for this. It suggests that in cases of probability such as which slit the photon travels through, the universe splits into two universes for each option. Furthermore, on very small scales such as those of single photons, the universes can interact with each other, and the photon can interfere with its counterpart in the other universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watch the &quot;Universe or Multiverse&quot; lecture, by Andrei Linde:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlHvQLxb4cw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlHvQLxb4cw</a></p>
<p>It explains that multiverses would account for why the laws of physics are the way they are and not something else by saying that other universes could have different laws and the only reason why our universe has our laws is that otherwise we wouldn't be here to ask that question (this is called the Anthropic Principle), so if other universes exist, you could make that argument.</p>
<p>Multiverse theory is NOT the same as Everett's Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics (also known as the No Collapse interpretation). This interpretation of quantum mechanics &quot;resolves&quot; the problem of wavefunction collapse by saying that the wavefunction does not collapse at all but our observations are only in a specific component of the universal wavefunction so to us it seems like the wavefunction has collapsed, when in actuality all the other possibilities are contained in other components of the wavefunction that are now inaccesible to our measurement instruments. This interpretation makes no statements about other universes, as strictly speaking, all these other possibilities are still happening in our universe, with the same physical laws, just that the observers in the other branches of the universal wavefunction see different outcomes to their measurement.</p>
<p>Note that both multiverses and the Many Worlds interpretation have not been experimentally detected. Take that as you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are talking about the Many-World's interpretation of quantum mechanics. The idea of the multiverse is a much broader subject. Did you mean to ask about the Many-Worlds interpretation? Also adding to the double slit experiment, the interference pattern for light was expected because it was known to be electromagnetic waves. It wasn't till later that they discovered light sometimes acts as particles (photons) and then they did it one photon at a time. These photons are still waves though and we know what's waving. The really weird part is then DeBroglie suggested maybe particles of matter might act like waves. Eventually they tested it with the double slit experiment, but instead of light they used electrons. Actual particles of matter, and they got an interference pattern. Now that is crazy. Matter acts like waves at very small scales, and that's what a big part of the debate with all the different interpretations is about. What's waving? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum systems exist in an overlap of states until a measurement is made, at which point they suddenly pick a state.  It is theorized at that moment something happens like a choosing a fork in the road.  The experiment, you, and that quantum system tick together into a specific future, as opposed to all the other possible outcomes of measuring the system.  This was mainly thought up to explain the double slit experiment which proved one particle can take separate paths, unless it is measured, at which point it takes one path, which sounds impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
