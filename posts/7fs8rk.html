		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question.</p>
<p>The reality that we've discovered in the past couple decades is that identical twins <em>won't</em> have identical DNA as they age. To clarify, the order of their DNA will be the same, but they'll have unique &quot;markings&quot; on their DNA that differ. Imagine if you gave the same news article to two people and asked them to highlight the important parts. This phenomenon is what we call &quot;epigenetics.&quot;</p>
<p>These markings are actually small additions to the structure of our DNA that control how active and inactive certain sections/genes are. What we've discovered is that these extra markers are acquired during life, and in certain cases can be passed down to our offspring. Some are added and removed constantly based on environmental factors, ensuring that identical twins will never really be identical. Others are more &quot;permanent&quot; and offer an avenue for distinction.</p>
<p>In one of the first studies on this, we essentially starved parent mice (but not to death), and then looked at both their DNA and that off their offspring. The parents adapted to low food environments by adding these on/off markers to certain metabolism genes, and that was passed to the offspring. The offspring survived on low food availability without the adjustment period of their parents.</p>
<p>I'm sure a forensics expert can tell you precisely what's tested, but this is where we're at right now in the field of genetics. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: My apologies that most of my follow-up answers to questions below this have been &quot;we really don't know,&quot; but honestly we really don't know a whole lot about epigenetics yet.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ID twins and I’ve asked doctors questions like this before, especially my genetic specialist. ID twins have enough difference in their DNA for experts to tell them apart, even when they’re born. Just like they don’t have identical fingerprints, their DNA differs. However most paternity tests aren’t 100% conclusive either — they usually give a 97% probability outcome at best. Even between regular siblings, paternity tests aren’t always conclusive. So the short answer is yes, but it would be expensive to drill down to get your answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to epigenetics, the twins would have slightly different histone packing and modifications to the DNA.  But I don't feel this would result in a usable system for paternity testing.  Whilst in labs the methylation of DNA can have readouts, but even with the inheritance of methylation patterns these can change, and in addition, anything more 'permanent' would have likely also been inherited from the twins parents, therefore they would share similar unlikely to change patterns.  I don't feel that with our with current technology of investigating epigenetics, it could offer a viable option for paternity testing.<br />
Alternatively, I propose that DNA sequencing would be far more viable - traditionally, paternity tests look at the length of specific genes to give a readout.  However, in our case, we would need to look at the actual genes coding regions (A,C,G,T).  The DNA repair and copying machinery are not infallible, and often makes small mistakes when you consider the size of the genome and the number of cells we have.  These are called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (switching a C to a T for example).  You would need to look at a longer strand of DNA, and then read what the code is AAGGCATACTGA etc and possibly multiple genes but then any errors generated in one of the twins during conception will likely also have been inherited by the child.  I feel this is a method that would offer answers with our current technology, and it would not be prohibitively expensive.  Basically, you're comparing errors within the genome, because identical twins will still have errors between them, however rare they may be.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> I want to point out, I am not referring to NEW accumulative errors within somatics (adult) cells, these would not be inherited unless these are found in the sperm and meiotic progenitor cells (although still an option!) - I an proposing screening for mutations that were generated during the period when the father was an embryo which will have manifested throughout his system and gametes, these would still be evident when the father was any age and then inherited within the child.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
