<p>My buddy likes to broadcast his favorite music, pirate style, but he does it from a truck and gets away with it.  probably not enough range to ruffle any government feathers, just a few confused commuters from time to time ..trying to figure out why Rush Limbaugh suddenly dropped the bass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If amateurs can do it for weekend fun, a government law enforcement agency is gonna be more than capable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So here is a true story. I was on a military exercise in nirthern california. I am electronics technician and responsible for the operation and maintenance of RF (radio frequency) equipment. We were operating in the VHF portuon of the spectrum and had a single channel plain text (unencrypted) net set up using 89.7 mhz as the transmission frequency. At one point our primary net went down due to equipment failure and switched to the 89.7 mhz frequency. After operating on thatvnet for about 4 hours a helicopter was circling our position and 3 federal agents in government vehicles arrived at the entry control point of our basebin the field. We were told that we were interfering with a public broadcast and needed to cease operations on thay frequency immediately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is &quot;pirate radio&quot;. And nothing really stops someone from doing it, other than the fact that you'll get found and get in trouble with the FCC fairly quickly. Well, that and the initial cost of building a transmitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
