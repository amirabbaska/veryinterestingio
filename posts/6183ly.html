We just irrigate with saline. Studies show tap water is just as good. Antiseptic solutions like chlorhexidine or betadine have been shown to both irritate the subcutaneous tissue and inhibit wound healing, so we don't use them except around the wound edges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is right, but nobody is giving you a particularly relatable answer.</p>
<p>Take 3 of the most common antiseptics, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, and iodine. </p>
<p>On their own they work great.  But hydrogen peroxide is a strong &quot;oxidizer&quot;, a term in chemistry that means it has free oxygen that reacts with other chemicals.  (It's H2O2, meaning one oxygen splits off to create h2o and o and the o is reactive).</p>
<p>The Hydrogen peroxide will oxidize the alcohol, making it less effective, and it will oxidize the iodine and create a different chemical all together.</p>
<p>Edit:  just tried this so I wasn't a hypocrite in case it didn't work.  If you have dry hands, pour alcohol on them.  It will burn. Now pour peroxide on your hand, it will fizz. Now mix equal parts alcohol and peroxide in a bottle or cup and shake it vigorously for a few seconds, then let stand for a few seconds.  Now pour it on your hand.  It won't fizz, and it won't burn, and it won't smell that strongly of alcohol either.  And oddly enough, it'll feel a little slippery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any time that you're dealing with chemicals, there is an opportunity for those chemicals to interact in a undesired way if you mix them. As an example, <del>chlorine</del> ammonia and bleach are both excellent cleaning chemicals, when used by themselves. But if you mix them, they are going to chemically combine to form a horribly corrosive gas. </p>
<p>That's an extreme example, but it's possible that mixing different antiseptics could produce some type of result which reduces the effectiveness of the antiseptics or creates a dangerous situation.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456300_1" target="_blank">a lot of debate</a> about whether you should put any antiseptic at all on an open wound.  Many believe it impairs healing.  I took a wilderness first aid class in which the instructor taught that it's best to just irrigate the wound with clean water and bandage it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh dear, please don't apply antiseptics to open wounds. Clean around, flush debris with clean water (ideally sterile, but potable is good enough), and dress to prevent more debris getting in.</p>
<p>If the wound is open, microbial infiltration is already a forgone conclusion. Superficially treating the wound isn't going to help with infection (antibiotics, instead) and will screw you up in all sorts of other ways, depending on substance. </p>
<p>EDIT: and, dear parents, for every well-intended time you subjected my skinned knees or other abrasions to hydrogen peroxide: thaaaanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
