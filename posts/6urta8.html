		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Such an effect exists, it is called nocebo. Many experiments have been conducted to demonstrate this effect. For example:</p>
<p>People were randomly splited into two groups. For participants from the first group were shown a film that wireless WiFi networks are dangerous to health. For participants from the second group showed a film about the fact that there is no proven danger of wireless networks with WiFi. After that, participants were subjected to 15 minutes of fake irradiation (that is, they were told that they were irradiated with WiFi, but in fact there was no radiation). From non-existent exposure to some participants, it became so bad that they asked for an interruption of the experiment. Most participants noted the symptoms that they associated with non-existent WiFi irradiation and among those who watched the film about the dangers of WiFi, there was a greater proportion of participants who indicated the presence of symptoms caused by irradiation. Thus, the media reports about the horrors of the phenomena faced by the inhabitants can have a negative impact on the state of health of the audience of these materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about whether awareness of a medical intervention taking place affects the efficacy of that interventions.</p>
<p>For example would there be a difference between someone who knows they are taking an antihypertensive versus someone who is being secretly given the same medication, assuming that both have the same lifestyle.</p>
<p>I don't see such a study ever occurring due to the requirement for informed consent.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The great thing about real medicine is that it will always inherently do what it's really supposed to do, no matter what you believe.  However what you're asking about is just a form of the placebo effect.</p>
<p>As people are also mentioning the nocebo effect, let's define the 2 terms:  placebo effect is when you believe you're taking an action that will create an effect, and that effect manifests itself, even though the action has no inherent link to the effect .  Nocebo effect is when you know you're taking a fake action that will create an effect, and that effect manifests itself.  So placebo you don't know that the pill is a sugarpill and it works anyway, and nocebo you know it's a sugarpill and it works anyway.</p>
<p>Why do I say &quot;action&quot; and not &quot;take a pill&quot;?  Because this can be any action you deem helpful, pill-taking has become synominous with something healthy, but seeing a &quot;doctor&quot; can also be viewed medicinally, or doing any action and I mean <em>any</em> action that either has an association or with which you create an association, like walking, or putting on cream, or going to a masseuse.</p>
<p>What you're describing is taking a real drug and then because of belief you suppress the effect the drug has on your body, this is within the placebo parameters, and belief really is that strong.  There is a study that was made where people were given pills and told that they would make them hyper and really stressed.  The pills were a relaxant, which meant people could really feel a real effect coming over them, they associated it with what they were told and became hyper and stressed although the opposite should have occurred.</p>
<p>So your expectations about what is going to happen are as important as what is really happening.  And all the studies regarding nocebo effect should tell you to create small inexpensive healthy habits and associate positivity and healthfulness to them as much as you can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
