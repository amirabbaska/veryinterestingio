		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical engineer here (some material engineer might come around and give a better explanation):</p>
<p>It all has to do with the crystalline composition of your Stainless Steel. Most of the Stainless steel is made of Ferritic SS, which is cheap to fabricate and can be transform quite easily. Austenitic SS is the most corrosion resistant steel and is mostly used for specific application. The 304 series are usually used for Food grade purpose for example. Both of them are non magnetic.</p>
<p>Mastensitic SS is highly durable, very hard and easy to machine. Those 3 properties makes it very good for kitchen knives. It is also (almost?) the only type of SS that is magnetic.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stainless steel used for knives uses an alloy with less chromium to allow for heat treatment which will make the skin of the knife harder so that it keeps an edge better. -given the right circumstances, these knives will rust. </p>
<p>Countertops don't need that hardenability, but benefit from the increased corrosion resistance that a higher chromium alloy offers.
The breakover point for magnetism is 20% chromium. Above that, no magnetism, below that, magnets stick. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's talking about what makes a steel ferromagnetic or not, so I'll talk about the other side of the question: countertops in particular.</p>
<p>If you have a <em>private</em> countertop that's not ferromagnetic, that's probably because a higher chromium content makes it easier to polish, and if you're choosing stainless steel for the home instead of granite or marble, it's probably because you want the look of shiny, polished metal.</p>
<p>Commercial kitchens have work surfaces intended to be durable, easily cleaned, and cheap. (It's really expensive to start a restaurant, and they don't tend to last very long, so you get cheap prep tables.) A variety of steel alloys work for that purpose, some of them ferromagnetic and some not.</p>
<p>If you went to a restaurant kitchen and found that it had a stainless steel countertop that was not ferromagnetic, it was probably because the manufacturer found a source of reasonably priced metal that fit their requirements that happened not to be ferromagnetic.</p>
<p>Conversely, I have a stainless steel countertop from a restaurant supply store. It was cheap. I have a bunch of magnets attached to it right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have mentioned the different alloys and which ones are/aren't magnetic, but no one has mentioned the reason. I'll take a stab at it but it's been a while since I learned the theory. Maybe someone else can go into more technical detail. </p>
<p>The molecules of different materials have different resistance to realigning their poles in the presence of a magnetic field. In pure iron, the domains move more freely, and in stainless, the extra metals added interfere with that temporary realignment. Think of the magnetic field as water flow, and the metal as a bunch of tiny tubes all jumbled up and not connected. Iron allows the tubes to realign into a flow path for the field, whereas stainless can't realign as easily. Once there's a path for flow, the field holds on to the metal it has realigned, creating the force that you feel when you try to remove the magnet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
