		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it's a bit off topic but those machines are extremely sensitive and can detect the tiniest amounts of anything they are looking for. My local airport uses 2 machines, one to just identify <em>if</em> there's anything on your hands. If that one picks anything up they bring you to a small holding area and test your hands again this machine figures out exactly what's on your hands. How do I know this? Well...</p>
<p>I worked on F-15's for the air force. My grandmother passed away so I flew home for a week to visit my family. A full week of washing my hands and showering daily (I shoild mention Im always very thorough ti wash the backs of mya hands). On my return trip I went to go through airport security and accidentally forgot a foil wrapper in my back pocket. They had to swab my hands as a precaution. It dinged positive. Talking to the TSA agent he was former air force and we chatted casually while he ran my hands through the bigger machine. After a minute or 2 he gets a print off from the machine and chuckles &quot;You said you work on airplanes? That explains why you have jet fuel on your hands.&quot; So yeah, even after all that time, washing my hands frequently (funeral lots of hand shaking etc.) And showering daily. Some how that machine was still able to pick up the JP-8 on my hands. I don't even work directly with the stuff it just leaks all over the place from tiny leaks in the jet's skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These machines are mostly ion-mobility spectrometers (IMS). The swab sample (solid or liquid) is ionized, coming up off the swab and into the air (as a gas). Ions are electrostatically pulled down a drift tube, which has an electric field (mobility source pulling the ions) and a detector. </p>
<p>The detector records the time it took for each ion to travel down the drift tube, which can be compared to lookup tables for common chemical warfare agents/explosives, drugs, etc. The operator gets a red light if any dangerous matches are found.</p>
<p>TSA can reuse a swab dozens of times as long as no positive result has been triggered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to how the machines work aside from this example (very rudimentary).</p>
<p>Let's say you have gun powder, or TATP or some other homemade explosive(HME) residue on your hands, clothes etc.  The swabs pick that up, and they're ran through the machine.  The machine throws in ions, or whatever else that react to the ions or bonds that are on the swab and then that mixture is sucked out and interpreted based on the bonds.  Results come out in a graph and the machine displays the results.  It is possible that some other compounds will pop positive for HMEs, sanitizer, lotions, grease etc.</p>
<p>False positives can be common based on the machine and when it was calibrated last.</p>
<p>Source: I'm an EOD tech that responds to positive results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been explained in detail already, but my side note is I worked as a nanny for a pilot and a flight attendant, every Fourth of July we'd have fireworks outside, and I was tasked with picking up &amp; cleaning up the mess after because if they touched them &amp; gunpowder transferred onto their skin it would flag them at these checks as it does not easily wash off. </p>
<p>Unrelated but the pilot also tested positive for opium one morning after eating a poppy seed muffin. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The machine checks for explosives residue. False positives are fairly common and usually caused by handling explosives or chemicals that can form explosive compounds. There are lots of fairly common agricultural/industrial chemicals that can be used to cook up explosives but also have other totally legitimate uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
