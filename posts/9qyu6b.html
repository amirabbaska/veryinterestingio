		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's assume that everyone picks their numbers at random. We know that's not true, but it simplifies things. Suppose we've sold <em>t</em> tickets, with <em>n</em> possible combinations of numbers. For this draw, <em>n</em> is about 302 million and <em>t</em> will be around 378 million (there were 15.8 million winners, and there's a 1 in 24 chance of a prize).</p>
<p>The probability that no one picked the winning numbers is ((<em>n</em>-1)/<em>n</em>)^(<em>t</em>), which gives us around 29%.</p>
<p>The probability that a particular ticket is the sole winner is<br />
(1/<em>n</em>)((<em>n</em>-1)/<em>n</em>)^(<em>t</em>-1), which is about 1 in a billion. Multiply that by the 378 million tickets, and the probability of a single winner is about 36%.</p>
<p>That leaves about a 35% chance of multiple winners. Given that there was a winner, it's about a 50/50 chance that the prize would be shared. Since real players tend to prefer certain combinations of numbers, a single winner should be a bit less likely than that. There'll be more unsold combinations than we expect, and the sold combinations will on average be more likely to have multiple tickets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the previous drawing, they sold 52% of all the possible combinations of numbers, and there was no winner.  The stats aren't out yet, but they estimated they would sell 65% of all the numbers.  That means there is a 2/3 chance of a winner.  Most people play random draws, and while there are no doubt many duplicates, the odds of a duplicate winning aren't very good, and by that I mean much less good than the extremely unlikely chance of winning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I've stole that 378 million tickets were sold. </p>
<p>You're asking two separate questions here. Also, just for pedagogical reasons, this isn't a statistics problems, this is a probability problem. Anyways,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can ask what the probability is that exactly 1 person wins the jackpot (tl;dr 35%)</p>
</li>
<li>You can ask what the probability is that at least 1 person wins the jackpot. (tl;dr 71.32%)</li>
</ol>
<p>Calculating the probability that at least 1 person wins is much easier. I don't know how many people played, but since the probability of winning is 1/(302 575 350), the probability of losing is (302 575 349)/ (302 575 350). So the probability that zero people win is the probability that EVERYONE fails, which is just </p>
<pre><code>                    [(302 575 349)/ (302 575 350)]^x </code></pre>
<p>where x is the number of people playing. But we're not looking for the probability everyone fails, we're looking for the probability that at least 1 person succeeds. But that's easily shown to be just 1 - probability that everyone fails.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, the probability that at least 1 person wins is</strong></p>
<pre><code>             **1-[(302 575 349)/ (302 575 350)]^x, where x is the number of valid tickets**.</code></pre>
<h2>Edit: So the probability that at least 1 person wins, if x= 378 million, is 71.32%</h2>
<p>Calculating the probability that exactly 1 person wins is a bit harder. The probability distribution of winning the lottery is actually what is known as a binomial distribution. </p>
<p>A binomial distribution is one where you have n trials, with each trial only having two possible outcomes, either a &quot;success&quot; or a failure&quot;. In this case, each person playing the lottery is a trial, so n=total number of tickets, and a &quot;success&quot; or a &quot;failure&quot; is obvious-- whether they win the jackpot or not.</p>
<p>In a binomial distribution, each trial needs to have the same probability of success. Let p= the probability of success on any given trial. In this case, p= 1/302 575 350. Then you can say</p>
<p><em>p(exactly k successes)= (n Choose k)(p^k )(1-p)^n-k , where n Choose k= n!/[k!(n-k)!)].</em></p>
<p>Thus, the probability that exactly 1 ticket wins is</p>
<p>p( 1 success)= n!/[1!(n-1)!] <em> (1/302 575 350)^1 </em> (1- 1/302 575 350)^n-1 , where n is the total number of people who bought tickets. This simplifies to</p>
<p><strong>n (1/302 575 350) (302 575 349 / 302 575 350)^n-1</strong>, where n is the number of valid
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Thus the probability that exactly 1 person wins is 35%</strong></p>
<p>P.S These formulas all actually have fairly simple (ELI10) derivations. If anyone is particularly interested in why the odds of winning the jackpot are 1/302575350, or how the binomial formula comes about, I'm more than happy to explain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you have two stats here.</p>
<p>One. The simple one, chance of winning a jackpot is 1:x where x is the total number of combinations that can be produced.</p>
<p>Two. The less simple one. y:x where why is the number of tickets purchased assuming the possibility that each ticket has a unique number until you reach the total number combinations. If you end up with a 1:1 ratio it's impossible to be the sole jackpot winner.</p>
<p>Then you combine the two stats which I don't recall the fourmula.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is impossible to say if you do not defines the rules of the lottery and how many people play is. If the jackpot accumulate overt time the probability that is is not won depend on the number of sold tickets each round.</p>
<p>The answer also depend of the question the probability when a jackport of $1.6 billion have accumulated or if you include the the probability that is accumulate. If is is including the accumulation is the probability to win exactly $1.6 billion or at least $1.6 billion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
