		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is your body's attempt at regulating internal heat and avoiding hyperthermia (heat stroke).  Lethargic, slow, and confused behavior is an important sign of heat stroke, so be careful when you feel this way.</p>
<p>The more active you are, the more oxygen your cells burn and you generate more internal heat.  This heat MUST be radiated away from your body or you will die.
Normally it is not a problem, but when it is very hot the air cannot draw heat from you fast enough.  Also high humidity can make sweating useless.  Sweating cools you via evaporation, and if it is very humid your sweat cannot evaporate to cool you.  The mere act of producing sweat also requires yet more energy that adds to the fatigue.</p>
<p>By forcing you to &quot;chill&quot; out and relax, your body drastically cuts down on the amount of heat it produces, giving extra time for heat to radiate away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how you feel after playing kickball? All hot and sweaty and you don't wanna do anything except watch Teen Titans? and how that one time I spritzed you with a water bottle and the mist felt good on your skin and after a few minutes you finished your juice box and you were better?</p>
<p>Your body is like a little motor, but if it gets too hot it can get damaged (like that one time your sister sally's birthday balloons went over the top of her birthday cake candles and popped! they got too hot and KaPOOF!)</p>
<p>So your body has to work hard to keep itself cool...it will sweat and get all drippy wet. And it takes a lot of energy to do that. The energy you COULD be using to run around and play fetch with Scooter...(because he is the HECKIN best doggo...)...but instead you have to use that energy to stay cool so your heart and brains and stuff still work. </p>
<p>That's why. So next time just help your body by cooling off yourself and chilling, and you'll be fine. </p>
<p>Then we can go watch Teen Titans together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, the human body can only tolerate a narrow range of internal temperatures (~35-40C). And physiological behaviors associated with higher/lower end of that temperature is incredibly predictable. On the lower end, people shiver in an attempt to get muscular activity that will produce more heat. On the higher end of the temperature, people sweat, more blood is distributed to the skin (to help heat escape), and they generally fatigue in an attempt to reduce further heat production via musculoskeletal movement. Of course, reality is much much more complicated. But long story short, I'd imagine its an evolutionary adaptation for preventing hyperthermia by reducing production of more heat. </p>
<p>As a scientist, I used to make people play jump-rope around 35.5 and 39.5C line for a whole host of reasons. I've put myself through those temperatures as well. Feel free to ask more probing questions/PM me if you're interested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
