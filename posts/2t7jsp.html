		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I read months ago about this issue, the rule has a loophole that says that it is acceptable as long as an adapter to micro-USB is included in the box. The speculation was that Apple would simply include the adapter with European iPhones.</p>
<p>Since then, more interesting developments have occurred. The USB group is promoting a new connecter standard called &quot;USB C&quot; that, like Apple's proprietary Lightning cable, is reversible. <em>Further</em>, while Lightning cable is not thought to be able to support full USB 3 transfer speeds (5Gbps) to to a deficiency of pins, the USB C connector standard supports USB 3.1 (10Gbps) <em>and</em> a new USB-based standard for carrying power that allowed USB C to carry up to <em>100 watts</em>. To put 100 watts in perspective, Apple currently produces 3 different power supply adapters for their laptops: 45 watt for MacBook Airs, 60 watt for 13&quot; Macbook Pros, and 85 watt for 15&quot; MacBook Pros. That means that 100 watts is easily enough to power and charge Apple's most powerful laptops.</p>
<p><strong>Most interestingly</strong>, rumors abound about a new ultra thin and portable Mac laptop that is so thin that it eschews all connectors besides a single headphone port and a single USB C port. As in, you will be using that USB C plug as the primary means of charging the laptop. So if you need to charge your laptop and plug in to USB devices and external displays simultaneously, there will probably be port(s) on the new power supply to allow that.</p>
<p>With Apple promoting USB C as a major new connector, my bet is that they eventually replace their Lightening ports with USB C, which will be compatible with Euro regulations.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I dug up some articles</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/retina-macbook-air/" target="_blank">Overview and history of the 12&quot; MacBook rumor</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2015/01/11/rumored-12-inch-macbook-9to5macs-mark-gurman-talks-new-connector/" target="_blank">Article about the USB C port on the rumored 12&quot; MacBook</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced" target="_blank">Technical details of the 100 watt power supply and DisplayPort over USB C specifications</a></p>
<p>So it looks like you are able to get up to up to 10Gbps data transfer, 4K video feed, HD surround sound audio feed, and 100 watts of power simultaneously through 1 USB type C cord if I am understanding the technical details.</p>
<p>To extrapolate the way Apple has productized in the past, it looks like Apple will be able to make cheap passive adapters to convert the USB C port into: a standard USB connector, a gigabit ethernet connector, a thunderbolt/DisplayPort connector, HDMI, DVI, and VGA connectors, maybe firewire if they feel like continuing to support it.</p>
<p>There has got to be a way to plug in displays and peripherals when you're charging the thing. Maybe the standard power supply will include at least a pass through USB C connector or 2 that can be adapted to whatever ports you need. Maybe more ports than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the council did not specify that it has to be micro USB. Just that it should be a common charger. Second, many here seem to be under the misconception that this is a law. It's a directive, which does work differently.</p>
<p>So to your question:</p>
<p>The directive will be effective 2017, so Apple still has nearly two full years to work something out. There has been a voluntary agreement between smartphone producers to use microUSB in 2011, but that has run out since and some firms are already implementing their own solutions, again. Apple simply never signed this 2011 agreement.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone ELI5 why this is even going to be a law? Most phones already have a micro usb connection, and what does it matter if Apple uses lighting? The regulation should be that all cables end with a USB so that you don't have to buy new bricks/car adapters. </p>
<p>Edit: Yes I remember how phones used to be, I thought this law was proposed after the rise of android when most phones were smartphones and either had micro usb or Apple's connectors. I'll mark this comment as explained. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
