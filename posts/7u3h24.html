		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While you are running, the contracting muscles in your legs help the heart circulate blood through your body. Once you stop, that assistance is no longer available. That makes the blood pressure drop as blood begins to pool in the legs and feet.  That's why some people get dizzy after an abrupt stop. Unless you keep moving to help the heart circulate the blood, blood pressure may get so low you can actually pass out.  Although there doesn't seem to be any medical evidence that a cool-down walk will help your heart rate recover faster, it's still a good idea to do so to keep from passing out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cardiac rhythm is a complicated process governed by both your parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. There are many different factors to consider.
High intensity exercise causes blood pH to decrease (build-up of lactic acid from anaerobic respiration and production of CO2) and blood oxygen concentrations to drop. This change is detected by central chemoreceptors in the hypothalamus, and peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies increasing pulmonary ventilation.
Walking would allow for muscular massaging of deep veins increasing venous return to the heart, which in turn would increase cardiac output (Bainbridge effect and Frank-Sterling effect).
Greater pulmonary ventilation (from exercise) with a greater cardiac output (from walking) would facilitate the normalisation of blood conditions (homeostasis).
This would allow for a more gradual return to resting heart rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
