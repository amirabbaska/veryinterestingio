		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your brain wants you to do something, it releases <strong>dopamine</strong> to force you to do it. The more dopamine your brain releases, the more you feel compelled to do whatever it is your brain wants you to do.</p>
<p>In other words, dopamine is your brain's &quot;gotta have it&quot; chemical. It is what makes you crave things to varying degrees. And the more dopamine your brain is outputting, the more uneasy and uncomfortable you feel until you act on its urges.</p>
<p>Then when you finally complete that task that dopamine has forced you to act on... and you've gotten whatever &quot;prize&quot; was waiting at the end of that task... your brain releases a rush of <strong>serotonin</strong> to match the dopamine it just outputted.</p>
<p>Serotonin is your brain's &quot;got it&quot; chemical, shutting off the fountain of dopamine that was compelling you to seek out whatever you wanted.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, the <strong>brief combination of high dopamine and high serotonin in your brain</strong> acts as a reward mechanism. It gives you a feeling of immense pleasure.</p>
<p>It's nature's way of rewarding you for taking a specific behavior.</p>
<p>Think about a time when you were a little hungry... then really hungry... then completely starved. It was dopamine being released in varying quantities in your brain that caused to feel those growing levels of hunger.</p>
<p>And think about how relieving it felt when you finally ate. You likely gorged yourself and you felt INCREDIBLE. That was the combo of high dopamine and high serotonin in your brain.</p>
<p>You experience the same thing when you build up the nerve to ask a girl out... and then she says yes. Or when you go on a long run and then make it home, safe and sound. And when you jump out of an airplane (followed by landing safely on the ground). And when you watch scary movies (then go back to &quot;safe&quot; reality).</p>
<p>It's all dopamine making you feel uneasy (escape! eat that food! make it to safety! get out of this awful situation!)... followed by serotonin when you'd achieved your mission... followed by pure unadulterated bliss in the brief moment when your brain was flooded with both chemicals at once.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>nicotine &quot;artificially&quot; creates this rush of serotonin in your brain</strong>. So if you're stressed (i.e. you have extremely high dopamine levels from something being incomplete or scary in your life), cigarettes temporarily create the surge of serotonin that turns off dopamine -- and leaves you feeling extreme pleasure.</p>
<p>But, since they're not <em>actually</em> solving the issues causing high dopamine for you, the dopamine just comes back... but eventually comes back at higher, and higher, and higher levels. It acclimates to your &quot;artificial&quot; serotonin source.</p>
<p>So the pleasure and calm you get from cigarettes (and their &quot;artificial&quot; serotonin hit) increases with time -- but your addiction (and stress) also grows.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to see what part of the nervous system it stimulates. There's sympathetic (which is fight or flight) and parasympathetic (which is rest and relax). It stimulates the parasympathetic part which gives the relaxing effect. Apart from that it increases blood flow leading to more blood to the brain making you more alert and focused. Hence why people smoke when they are anxious, to be more focused and calm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I started taking Wellbutrin for depression a while ago and the doctor told me that one of the side effects is that it could severely curtail your desire to smoke. He said that Wellbutrin was developed years ago to help people quit smoking but they also found that it could help people with depression, so that became the primary focus of the drug - I still smoked for several months before I decided to quit, but it was like forcing myself to smoke because I lost the desire to do it, the drug is so strong and so good at stopping the urge to smoke (at least for me it was) - In January, 2016 I stopped smoking after over 40 years (and many frustrating years of trying to stop on my own) and I have not had any urge at all to smoke since then and I am very grateful - I feel fantastic now just like everybody said I would. Quitting smoking completely changed my life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of crazy unsubstantiated nonsense posted so far. This is complicated so I'll try to give you a thorough yet layman explanation. Nicotine has different affinities for receptors in the brain versus the peripheral nervous system. It also does not bind all nicotinic receptors equally. What the result of this is: is that nicotine produces both a sympathetic type of effect, due to the actions of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucose released from liver, and also parasympathetic type actions that improve cognition and decrease stress through the actions in the central nervous system, chief among these being the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>In a nutshell it puts your body in fight or flight Mode, while putting your brain in a relaxed state that is better suited to cognition. There is also a weird pharmacokinetic property that the stimulant versus sedative effects reverse based on the level of nicotine in your blood. At a low concentration in your blood it will act as a stimulant, but at a high concentration like a sedative. This effect plays out not only due to the amount of nicotine ingested, but also the distribution of nicotine throughout your different body fluid compartments due to their varying permeability to the molecule.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nicotine acts on different receptors in the brain than the stimulants you're probably thinking of. A chemical's effect on the body can't be adequately explained in one word such as &quot;stimulant&quot; so you're bound to get nuanced effects that require greater understanding to differentiate rather than lumping everything into one category</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
