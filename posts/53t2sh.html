How long would i have to cycle for to charge them?, to heat my room for how many hours? basically is it worth doing, or would i be exhausted for little result?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll find that the actual cycling heats the room more than five times as much as the power that ends up in the batteries.</p>
<p>Humans are (roughly, and it varies from person to person) 20% efficient.  So if you're putting 120 watts into the pedals, your body will be dumping 480 watts of heat into the room just to begin with.</p>
<p>Of the 120 watts (a reasonable goal for a fit normal person for an hour) at the pedals, some will be lost to drivetrain friction, and then a much larger fraction will be lost at the alternator, and finally another fraction will be lost during the battery charging process.</p>
<p>The convenient thing, though, is that those by products are <em>usually</em> considered waste-- but when you're trying to heat a room, the fact that you're making hundreds of watts of waste heat so that you can run a heater briefly is a huge help.  The disparity between amount of &quot;waste heat&quot; and the amount you'd capture in the battery is so large, that it's almost not worth the effort of capturing it-- just put your bike on a trainer and ride, and it will be like running a 500-watt space heater in the room until you're done.</p>
<p>And yeah, you'll be exhausted, unless you're already used to endurance cycling.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The biking itself will heat the room much better than the little battery will.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The voltage of the battery is only one piece of the puzzle and on its own doesn't say much about how much energy it contains. The second component is the amount of charge in the battery. This is often measured in Ampere-hour (short: Ah) or milli-Ampere-hour (mAh). 1 Ampere-hour is simply the amount of charge that allows a 1 Ampere current to flow for 1 hour.</p>
<p>The energy content of a battery can be calculated by multiplying the voltage with the charge content. The outcome is expressed in Watt-hour, Wh. 1 Wh is the amount of energy used in 1 hour with a power of 1 Watt. 1 Wh is equal to 3600 J (Joule).</p>
<p>So a 12 V battery with 10 Ah of charge (which through quick googling seems to be a decent amount for a rechargable 12 V batterypack) will be able to provide 120 Wh of energy (or 432 kilo-Joule (kJ)). What can you do with this? Well, a 60 W lightbulb uses 60 Wh over the course of 1 hour. So you could run a 60 W bulb for 2 hours.</p>
<p>Small electric heaters that are intended to heat an entire room (as opposed to those that just blow hot air at a single person) use between 1 and 2 kW of power. That means that you're 12 V, 10 Ah battery would be depleted in about 4 to 8 minutes. Twice that if you use two batteries. This is not counting any losses due to inefficiencies in power conversion (which will be turned into heat, so they're not actually losses when heating up the place is the goal).</p>
<p>Suppose you use a heater that is designed to only heat you as a person rather than the room. You can find these at around 500 W. The 12 V / 10 Ah pack could power this for about 15 minutes in the ideal scenario. How long would you have to cycle to charge it?</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, the best bike dynamos will provide about 6 W of useful power output. Ignoring any losses while charging, this means that you need to bike for just 20 hours to charge up 120 Wh of battery capacity.</p>
<p>So 20 hours of biking for 15 minutes of heating. Not really worth it.</p>
<p>A somewhat related point of interest is that you have a more effective long term space heater available. You typically fuel it with various forms of biomatter (most models take plant and animal remains, though some shun the latter) and averaged over the day, this heater produces about 100 W of heat.</p>
<p>That's right. The average daily energy consumption of a human adult is somewhere around the 2000 KCal, which is 8.4 MJ. That boils down to around 100 W. Of course, in periods where you're active this'll be higher than in the passive moments. But even in passive moments it's a non-trivial amount. Which is why poorly ventilated rooms can heat up noticably when people stay in them for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>That means that you can still heat up your room by cycling, without having to mess around with batteries and space heaters. As long as you do the cycling inside your room. Your own heat production will heat the room much more than any battery-based solution ever could.</p>
<p>edit: Several people have correctly pointed out that a bike dynamo is meant for powering a small light while the bike still has to move. If you don't have to move, you can of course generate considerably more power. Ultimately though, you won't be able to power a very moderate space heater (1 kW) directly yourself with a 1:1 charge:use time ratio. Even a personal heater at 500 W will take an extremely good physical condition to reach 1:1 charge:use time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>alternatively, insulating your room (or building, or body i.e. with clothes) often turns out to be more economical than &quot;auxiliary&quot; heating. </p>
<p>your body's thermal output at rest could in some cases compensate your room's thermal losses if the insulation is good enough. </p>
<p>if the insulation is slightly not enough, increase your thermal output by riding a stationary bike or doing anything else, and/or light a candle (or burn anything in a safe way).</p>
<p>or run a heat pump with your stationary bike instead of your proposed resistive heating system. i.e. figuratively place a fridge in a wall-opening, open it towards the outside and have the &quot;condenser&quot; (the thing behind that gets dusty with time) inside your room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're trying to be thrifty... Then get better insulation in the room as a whole. Cover windows very well as these are generally the least insulated part of a building.</p>
<p>You can use a infrared lamp at your desk to heat you and not the room. </p>
<p>Get a sleeping bag to sleep in. A nice cold weather one from Amazon, they're pretty inexpensive, and will keep you warm even if it's 45 deg f in your room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>car batteries have different capacities but 70 Ah is average. So 2 car batteries will give you 2x12x70=about 1500 Wh of energy fully charged. A small electric heater uses 500-1500 Watts. So the batteries be enough to run the heater for 1-3 hours max.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
