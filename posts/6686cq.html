		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here are focusing on the US, citing US-specific reasons as if this is a US-specific phenomenon when it isn't. Things are exactly the same here in the UK and Europe in general, so whilst I'm sure the reasons cited are contributing factors I think they omit to mention a major factor that is common to the entire developed world: the reduced value of labour. This is long so I'll make a TL;DR at the end.</p>
<p>Pre-ww1 as you have observed, for most families the husband worked for money whilst the wife was primarily concerned with keeping the house in order and caring for their children. The wife may help out with garden or farmwork in some capacity and she may even have some paid employment as a cook or a cleaner on some limited basis if there were older children at home who could care for their siblings but <em>in general</em> the vast majority of the family income was provided by the husband such that the wife didn't <em>have</em> to work. Lots of women did work of course, particularly in areas like service, but not <em>married</em> women. For most the choice was marriage <em>or</em> employment, not both.</p>
<p>This began to change in the interwar years since it had become acceptable for women to enter many professions. Nursing and teaching are perhaps the best examples of this; the reason we consider these as 'female' professions today is because they were among the first where women really came into the foreground and were allowed to do so because it fit with the gender role of caring and childrearing. Women still didn't <em>have</em> to work however, the war and the push for universal suffrage had simply made it both more necessary (due to the reduced workforce) and acceptable (due to changing attitudes) for them to do so. Ultimately however many women did just go back to being housewives for their husbands and that remained economically feasible since few women really had a 'career' still, more an occupation that could be engaged in if they were single or needed less at home due to having no children to care for.</p>
<p>WW2 brought another profound shift for all the same reasons: even further reductions to the workforce of a world which had still not recovered from the previous 'war to end all wars' (bear in mind some poor bastards fought in both) and a realisation of the fact that women actually <em>could</em> do all the same jobs as men saw them really enter the workforce proper for the first time. When the men came home, it was no longer simply a case of them going back to their old lives since many did not wish to, and even if they did the economics of the time made that challenging as decreased supply of goods (Europe continued rationing well into the 1950s) increased their value and thus more work was required to maintain standard of living.</p>
<p>Rather than adjusting back to the old economy which was calibrated for only 50% of the population working though, things were recalibrated to assume everyone was. Thus, once populations recovered in the 1960s you suddenly had 2 people for every job there had been initially. GDP was increased of course and more jobs were created but fundamentally the value of labour had been reduced - all of which was excellent for business but (as others have explained in their criticism of Raeganomics on this point) not so good for the population at large. This effect was only exacerbated then from the 1960s onwards with the push for gender equality, since for the first time women really started to have careers rather than just jobs and began to equal or even overtake men in many fields - so it wasn't even safe for men in highly technical fields anymore where previously they had largely escaped this effect and had continued to be able to act as sole provider as a result of women being unable to enter their sectors of the workforce. By the 1980s the effect was largely complete, with women not only <em>able</em> to have a career but actually <em>expected</em> and all but <em>required</em> to do so - the societal values had shifted but also the economics.</p>
<p>Over the same time period, we also had a massive increase in automation. Whereas you once needed hundreds of men to work a field, you could suddenly buy a machine to do their work for you. The wars brought huge technological advances on top of those of the late 1800s leading up to 1914, further reducing the value of labour before you even consider the effective doubling in supply. Everything is only worth what its purchaser is willing to pay, and this includes labour - it stands to reason if the value of a mans work is reduced because he must compete with a machine <em>and</em> suddenly twice as many other people are available to do the job instead of him then he will be forced to accept lower pay whilst his employer reaps the benefits of both a mechanised workforce <em>and</em> cheap human labour. This effect of automation is only likely to increase, as computers and AI continue to encroach on jobs which people currently occupy today - driving wages down and profits for companies up.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Machines and women entering the workforce increased the supply of labour and thus reduced its value, reducing wages and requiring everyone to work in order to maintain standard of living at pace with technological advancement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got out of the Navy in Wash. D.C. in 1971 after 7 years as an electronics tech. Did a couple temp jobs in the Wash. DC area for a year and then went to San Jose (now called Silicon Valley) with a wife and a kid. No problem getting a decent high paid technician job paying $14K in 1973. Used the GI bill to buy a house for $28K with a mortgage less than rent on an apartment. Wife never worked (but is extremely frugal). I changed jobs whenever I heard about something more interesting that also paid more and we always seemed to have enough money even to buy a new car and motorcycle every few years. In 1985, sold the first house for $120K and bought new house for $150K keeping the same monthly payment making my cost of housing much lower than renters or first time buyers. Later I cashed in some stock options and bought a rental house with a small negative cashflow, sold it three years later for a profit and bought another house that had a positive cashflow. Finished college getting an EE using the GI bill. Career advanced, taking the most interesting and best paying job. I even took months off between jobs traveling in Asia. Eventually I aged out of the market and sold everything and retired living on social security and investments. </p>
<p>Nothing like that could happen today. I lived in the golden age of employment in technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WARNING: long historical analysis in broad strokes, that will rile people up with reactionary emotional responses and down-votes follows...</p>
<p>Wages and costs were once in parity. The line on the graphs for worst, median, and best salary were basically the same shape as the line for cost to buy a home, cost to buy a car, cost to raise a kid, and so on.</p>
<p>Then a particular and peculiar force took over the economy. People who'd read Ayn Rand (and similar nonsense) in the sixties became the makers of policy in the eighties. This brought us &quot;trickle down economics&quot; and corporate raiding and some other stuff. (Continued after aside...)</p>
<p>{deleted}</p>
<p>So the other key thing that happened is that the racists switched from the Democratic party to the Republican party in the sixties and seventies.</p>
<p>See &quot;Democrat&quot; used to to be the party of &quot;institutions&quot;, so business etc. these &quot;institutions&quot; included big business and racism was institutional before the Civil Rights Movement. This was an accident. If your government and business and your churches are all racist and you are in support of government and church and business, you got racist indoctrination as an underlayment.</p>
<p>The &quot;Republican&quot; was the party of &quot;individuals&quot; which <em>included</em> the Unions and Workers Rights and the Civil Rights Movement itself.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that business interests and workers rights were on opposite sides. </p>
<p>But then the Civil Rights Act passed. Institutions, particularly government and business <em>banished</em> racism.</p>
<p>So what's a racist to do? Well they switched sides.</p>
<p>So racism, my right to tell a ***** to (whatever) became an &quot;individual rights issue&quot;. People switched parties in droves. The fine &quot;Democrat&quot; institution of the KKK etc, wanted to continue on, so the message of the Republican party sounded like what they wanted.</p>
<p>The thing is that a lot of business and social (church) power was carried across the divide because those people <em>owned</em> those institutions and interests.</p>
<p>You have to look at the now-dead politicians of the age, the last to leave office or die being Strom Thurmond, who did the former by doing the latter. The pattern of defection from Democrat to Republican is historically obvious.</p>
<p>Even today, some GOP partisans point out that the KKK was a Democrat institution, but they lack the sense of history to understand why they should be suspicious that the KKK is now on their side.</p>
<p>See the Civil Rights Movement was revolutionary instead of evolutionary, so the structures of power didn't properly realign properly. Basically a lot of people moved &quot;right&quot; all at once, while nobody was moving left.</p>
<p>With the business owners and the unions now in the same party one had to lose status. Businesses had the money. A union couldn't shut down a business without losing the union, but a business could shut down a union and benefit.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that a lot of people just plain old <em>didn't</em> <em>notice</em> that the sides had switched up. The less educated you were, the less likely you were to read the papers, the easier it was to miss the fact that you might now be voting for the wrong side.</p>
<p>Unionists had just <em>nobody</em> to vote for because they &quot;knew&quot; &quot;Democrats were bad for unions&quot;, and largely they <em>were</em>, having had no reason to change their tune. They still had a lot of business interest and whatnot, with no worker base.</p>
<p>So with the individual rights people, the unions, and the businesses all in the same pile the Republicans started dismantling what they'd built for the individuals. Their social support agenda, their actual pro-worker mandate, and their successful Social Security and Welfare programs were not in the interests of their new business buddies.</p>
<p>So the eighties were an orgasm of deregulation and &quot;corporate raiding&quot;.</p>
<p>See the Objectivists came of age but landed in charge of the side that is supposed to protect workers interests. So they just let go of their side of the rope and started pushing it towards the right, and the Democrats were pulling to the right out of habit.</p>
<p>Basically the Republicans leapfrogged over the Democrats so that the entire political spectrum was just slewing to the side we now call &quot;right&quot;.</p>
<p>The democrats eventually realized that someone needed to be on the left, but by then the damage had been done.</p>
<p>At this point, with nobody protecting individual incomes of the working middle class, and even the working upper class, the wage growth lines basically flatten out for everybody who isn't a business <em>owner</em>.</p>
<p>The Objectivists and the business men dismantle regulation.</p>
<p>The Savings and Loan system collapses, and the barriers between the three types of banks (commercial, investment, and <del>housing</del> consumer) disappear. Now banks that are supposed to anchor commercial and individual (worker) interest are free to gamble, which creates a series of bubbles and bursts that the workers and government interests have to support because the firewall around risky investment is <em>gone</em> and investment banks can no longer be allowed to fail because they'll take business and personal interests down in the blast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, medical care has become for profit. Kaiser-Perminante (if memory serves) was the first non not-for-profit hospital, but once that barrier was pierced the HMOs and the for-profit hospitals took over in a tide.</p>
<p>The private institution of higher education has always been a thing, but with deregulation of student loans and the really broad application of the GI bill - and with the lack of political champions for education - tuition became a gold mine for schools. This happened right as the lust-for-advancement of the fifties was dying off. The dream of the twenties, thirties, and forties that science was going to solve everything died during a duck-and-cover exercise somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>Another regulation limited how many media companies any one business interest could control. With the death of that just a few businesses, a few <em>huge</em> businesses, can now &quot;set the message&quot;. &quot;Greed is good&quot;, &quot;they're poor because they are lazy&quot;, &quot;more deregulation will solve the problems of deregulation&quot;, &quot;free markets now&quot; (which is great for business but hell on workers). An endless series of messages that somehow just never understand that working people create value.</p>
<p>Democrats are slowly taking up the interests of the individual workers, the unions, the environment, and all the things that the Republicans dropped.</p>
<p>But terrific damage has been done. The economy and deregulation have left the vast majority of people far, far away from where they are supposed to be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile lots of people are one issue voters, voting for gun rights and electing people who want to remove every other law in their favor as a consequence.</p>
<p>Further still, there are people who've just got a formula for god-and-country or all-democrats-are-thieves (a leftover from when all democrats were businessmen).</p>
<p>And still further the &quot;big government is bad&quot; meme and the &quot;tax and spend&quot; meme that sits like a turd, ignoring the fact that the alternative is &quot;borrow and spend&quot;.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that someone &quot;scrambled the teams&quot; and orphaned the interests of the moderate worker who just wants a <em>fair</em> wage for <em>everybody</em>. Poor people vote republican because they think of Democrats as &quot;elitists&quot; because in the forties they <em>were</em>; that vote being totally blind to electing people who literally own elite country clubs. Rich people vote republican because it's good for their bank accounts. But then the republicans vote to dismantle <em>their</em> <em>own</em> prior policies that made our workforce so amazing and egalitarian. Meanwhile the Democrats are in a three-decades-long shell-shock identity crisis and our economy is slowly deflating as the money pours into the pockets of the ultra-rich.</p>
<p>QUICK UPDATE:</p>

<li>
<p>Thanks for the gold!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, this is USA-Centric. That's where I grew up. But if you look at our history of treaties and our role in the cold war, which was contemporary with this whole thing, and our control of two of the big-four world stock markets, it's pretty easy to see how we <em>exported</em> our worst ideas to the rest of &quot;the western world&quot;. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was alive for lots of this. I was born in 1964. I remember desegregation. I was initially republican. I am democrat now, but for lack of choice. As long as the U.S. has &quot;simple majority rule&quot;, as in you need 50% plus one guy to win, the math just gives any three-way split to the dominant party in the House, so we can't have nice things like a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I didn't &quot;forget about women entering the workforce&quot;, nor the &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;... nor automation. The continuous boogey-man of new workers is a role that has gone to Blacks, Irishmen, Scottsmen, Chinamen, and every other racist label you can think of. By always having some people forced to take slave-labor wages you can drive down the labor market artificially. Whenever fair labor laws change this for the current out-group we've seen economic booms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Kaiser Permanente&quot; is not-for-profit, but &quot;Kaiser Perminante Medical Group&quot; is a wholly owned for-profit entity. These sorts of distinctions are important. Sorry for confusing you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I am not a &quot;Communist&quot;, if you think everybody who references &quot;workers&quot; is a communist then you need to study the history of labor over the last 3 thousand years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, this is &quot;biased&quot;. Facts tend to be biased for having only one actual, factual condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I didn't include <em>your</em> pet theory, write your own post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character cap limits specificity in some areas.</p>
</li>
<li>No, this was not for literal five year old children. Read the rules in the side bar. 8-)</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<ul>
<li>look up &quot;Republican Southern Strategy&quot; it was that deliberate and done in plain sight.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US had post WW2 economic boom of orgasmic levels between 1950s-80s.  Some of the world was hurt from war, and a lot of it wasn't even developed yet.</p>
<p>The US was untouched, and had a massive manufacturing base.  This was a time when an unskilled guy could go out into his community, stand next to a conveyor belt, and make a sold middle class salary.  The coal mines, auto plants and factories were all up and running.</p>
<p>Then things changed.  Other countries started to catch up.  Business owners realized they could ship jobs to other countries and slash payroll in half.  Now that there's less jobs, wages are being driven down because workers are getting desperate.</p>
<p>So that's kind of where we're at now.  An economy with fewer jobs at lower wages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 good but not great salaries, jobs with all the benefits so health ins was free (really, free for the employee and only an added cost for family members but we each had our own) with a large company that people often stayed with their entire career. My husband had about $2,000 in student loans left and I didn't go to college so we knocked that out ASAP. The plan was a house before pets or kids and we bought one 2 years after we married, in 1984. for $99k with 10% down. Very small (1000sq ft) but cute. That house nearly doubled in value in 8 years and because my husband started and finished his MBA during that time he got promotions and raises and a company car, while I quit to stay home with the kids. Sold that place and bought another smallish place (1350sq ft) with a second bath in a better community for for $235k.</p>
<p>We rode the SF Bay Area real estate boom after that and added a family room but never moved again. It was nothing we did special, we just played by the rules that were in place at the time, and they made sense. These days there are no rules and nothing makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
