		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because they are polyphonic instruments, as compared to most instruments which can only play one note.    They can play chords, a pianist can play a chord and a melody.  Much more versatility.   If you are a bass player, sax player, drummer, it is a lot of fun, but to really do anything, you need a band to play with.   Keyboard or guitar can play solo or with a group.   </p>
<p>As a professional drummer, if I had to do it over again, I would have picked up piano. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Range is a reason, especially piano. Other reasons have to do with the evolution of western music, its pedagogy and social and musical trends throughout the (relatively short) history of these instruments that have meant that these instruments are now so popular. I am not an expert on this, just a music graduate, but I hope these make sense and help. I gather you're talking about their use in popular music, not 'classical' music, but I think they're both linked!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As other people have said, one of the big reasons for these two being so popular has to do with the fact that you can sing while playing. Obviously in contemporary music culture this is really prevalent but it is just as important to social norms surrounding music in previous centuries. I'm thinking in terms of parlour music in the 18th and 19th centuries, where it was really popular in middle class houses to learn to play and sing songs for entertainment (think Mary Bennett in Pride and Prejudice if you've read or seen it). Guitars and their related musical instruments (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lute" target="_blank">lutes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud" target="_blank">ouds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cittern" target="_blank">citterns</a>) are much much older than keyboard instruments. Instruments like these were favoured by medieval minstrels for a couple of hundred years, partly because they were very portable, but also probably because they meant a musician could accompany themselves when they were singing their compositions. The one-man-show singer-songwriter style of music has been popular for a long time.</p>
</li>
<li>Piano in particular has been a really stock-standard instrument for musicians for a long time. Many famous composers were extremely competent at the piano, because of the emphasis placed on learning the instrument in their musical education. This has to do with the piano's ability to play harmony and chords. In an era when 'classical' music had lots of harmonic rules that determined what was good composition and what was bad, boring or theoretically incorrect composition it was often important for a composer to be able to demonstrate their understanding at a harmonic instrument like the piano (with a big range, like you said) in short compositional exercises that they could play themselves, or by improvising. Mozart, Beethoven and Liszt are examples of composers who were said to be prodigious piano improvisors. The prevalence of composers who were amazing at piano also means it has a huge amount of great repertoire that pianists of lots of different skill levels can learn.
Being able to play harmony and chords on the piano make it a great instrument for beginners. It also has a much greater visual element to it than something like the violin or clarinet, as you can see every note in front of you and can count the relationship between notes of a chord and correlate that to harmonic theory. The guitar is sort of similar, as modern guitars are fretted in semitones, or half steps, and you can easily see the relationship between placing a finger down and the note going up or down. Therefore, piano and guitar are both widely taught instruments and it makes sense that people who perform and write music know how to play them- maybe they started out on them, or maybe they picked it up as an 'easy' accompaniment instrument (in lots of popular music contexts).</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a couple of reasons why the popularity of guitar and piano has developed from a long history of both popular and art music traditions. I hope this answer isn't overkill!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose it's 1850, you're hanging out with friends and family, and you want to hear some music. Of course, you can sing, but you'd like to have some accompaniment.</p>
<p>The piano and guitar are ideally suited to this situation. They can play complete songs with many parts or simple chord accompaniment, and they don't keep you from singing along. And in addition to that, they have a low learning curve — it's relatively easy for a novice to learn the piano well enough to provide simple accompaniment at an amateur level compared to, say, a flute or a bassoon (or even a violin).</p>
<p>In a time before radio or phonographs, the piano was a fixture in countless middle-class households. The guitar has the added advantage of portability — it's no coincidence that the guitar is the foundation of modern popular music.</p>
<p>The fiddle (violin) is less ubiquitous because it's tougher to start learning and you can't sing while playing, but it's very portable, <em>very</em> versatile, and capable of playing two or even three notes at once. This last feature is of critical importance for folk fiddlers. And while you can't sing while playing, you can alternate with ease.</p>
<p>The whistle (e.g. Irish tin whistle) is pretty common as well. It has a low learning curve and it's cheap and portable. Like the violin, you can switch off playing and singing.</p>
<p>These instruments, along with the drums, form the backbone of folk music around the world, and most music is folk music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other responses in this thread are great, but I'd like to also emphasize on the difficulty in playing these instruments. When you press on a key in piano, a note comes out the other end perfectly in tune (ideally). It's easy for somebody to see how going left/right on the keyboard translates to going up and down a scale. Compare it to a trumpet, where even if you press the correct valves, there is no guarantee that you'll even play the correct note let alone in tune or in tone without proper embouchure technique. On top of that, the fingering for trumpet may be confusing for beginners to grasp as they do not predictably follow any scale like in piano.</p>
<p>Guitar, like piano is easy to learn. The frets on a guitar will perfectly tune (again, ideally) any note even if your finger placement is not super precise. Strumming a guitar is easy for beginners to grasp and will almost always produce your desired sound assuming you have the correct finger placement. Compare it to violin, which has no frets and relies almost entirely on precision hearing and finger placement to play in tune. Good bow technique can make the difference between beautifully singing notes and the sound of pigs being slaughtered.</p>
<p>Both piano and guitar let people play relatively nice sounding music at a very low level especially with the abundance of online tutorials. With a lot of other instruments, they are hard to learn, and hard to master and some of those instruments, even at a master level still need another instrument to accompany them in order to play a full song.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional touring keyboardist/guitarist here. There are lots of reasons. One is polyphony, or the ability to play more than one note simultaneously, which allows for an undefinable array of styles and genres.</p>
<p>Also the piano is traditionally a household staple. Before radio or records, the upper middle class and higher would likely have had a piano in their home. How else would you be able to enjoy some music? I grew up in a house in the 90s where all the kids were forced to take piano lessons, which is not uncommon (I hated it, but obviously I'm grateful to my parents now). The piano also has the advantage of being a full-range instrument, which means it can cover almost the entire frequency spectrum that humans can hear.  </p>
<p>For example, are you recording or performing a song that seems to be missing something in a narrow range? A piano-based instrument can almost certainly fill that gap one way or another.</p>
<p>The guitar has the advantage of quick and easy basics. Just about anyone can pick up a guitar for the first time and within a half-hour be able to play at least one, but probably two, open chords. Learn two more, add a capo and you have the ability to play those four chords in just about any key, which is great if the song is say too high or too low for the singer. Many famous and talented singer/songwriters never learn much beyond that (and that's cool!). The electric guitar also defines rock and roll, which is totally and completely badass.</p>
<p>There's also a heavy pop culture element. Again, rock and roll makes everyone want to play a Gibson SG like Angus Young or slam the piano like Bob Seger. </p>
<p>Now go get yourself an instrument and kick ass.</p>
