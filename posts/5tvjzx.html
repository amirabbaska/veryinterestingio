I have a friend who just started it and it didn't work for them. Why do certain SSRIs work for some people but not others? Aren't our brains wired similarly enough?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that many of these drugs can take weeks to start taking effect. Every body reacts differently, so it's impossible to say if a drug will be effective in someone.</p>
<p>SSRIs stand for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. Basically, when your brain sends a signal to certain nerves, it releases serotonin. They float a little bit, and run into the next nerve, which has serotonin receptors. These molecules activate the receptors, and the next nerve continues the signal. <strong>(Think of it like the lighting the beacons of Gondor in LOTR. Each beacon is lit, and then the next beacon sees it, and lights their own)</strong>. </p>
<p>After some time, the nerve that released the serotonin will break it down, and retake the serotonin. This is normal, and the reason is that the nerve has serotonin ready to go the next time that it's fired. <strong>(In the LOTR analogy, this would be the equivalent of saying okay the next beacon should be lit. Let me put out my fire and rebuild the haystacks)</strong></p>
<p>However, if the next nerve didn't get the signal, then breaking down the serotonin will be a bad thing. So, we give SSRIs, which let the serotonin hang out by its receptors for a longer period of time. <strong>(Keep adding hay to the burning fire and hoping that the next guy will finally turn around and light his beacon)</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SSRI's work by blocking the 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) in the CNS. Examples include Prosac (Fluoxetine), Zoloft (Sertraline), and Lexapro (Escitalopram). According to the monoamine hypothesis, mood disorders/depression are caused by decreased 5-HT (aka serotonin) and norepinephrine in the CNS. SSRI's selectively inhibit serotonin reuptake in the synaptic cleft by the presynaptic neuron (opposed to SNRI's which inhibit the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE). By blocking reuptake, more 5-HT will be available in the cleft to transmit the signal.
I believe the reason it take ~4-6 weeks to take full effect has something to do with the 5-HT1B presynaptic autoreceptors becoming desensitized(?).
SSRI's are considered the first-line therapy for depression, anxiety, and OCD.</p>
<p>Not everyone responds the same to these drugs. For some people one SSRI works better than another SSRI. Sometimes an individual does not respond to SSRI's, but rather SNRI's or tricyclics amines (TCAs). Although the drugs work similarly, each person can respond differently. It takes time and often can take trying different versions of these drugs to find the therapeutic effect you desire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin is released from one brain cell to the next, the current belief is that more serotonin equals happier outlook.</p>
<p>After the serotonin is released it is absorbed back into the brain cell that released it to be used again. </p>
<p>SSRI's stop the serotonin from being absorbed back, meaning the brain cell receiving keeps receiving the same serotonin over and over. This means happier outlook.</p>
<p>Selective really just means the drug affects serotonin releasers more than it affects dopamine or various other transmitters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
