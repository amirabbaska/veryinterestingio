<p>EDIT: I'm going to make a TL/DR so you can get a sum of the thread in one spot without reading all the comments. <strong>HOWEVER</strong> please take the time to read if you can, especially if you want more information. Shoutout to /u/bbrhuft, /u/urbanek2525, /u/tea_and_biology, /u/genius_retard, and anyone else who I may have forgotten. </p>
<p>Thread TL/DR: There are two different paths that a plant can take to photosynthesize: C3 and <strong>C4</strong>. C4 is more efficient at doing this, so the best plants for getting that carbon out of the atmosphere would be something that goes through this pathway. A good common example is a <strong>grass</strong> or <strong>bamboo</strong>.</p>
<p>A fast-growing plant like grass (bamboo) or algae will go through this process the fastest, but to keep the carbon locked away, it requires a fair amount of upkeep. You can't just bury the freshly cut plant because it will create methane. You will have to essentially &quot;burn&quot; it in an oxygen-free environment, creating charcoal, and then bury it away to keep that carbon out of the atmosphere (Shockingly, I didn't think of this before. Reverse the use of charcoal by... creating charcoal and burying it). The alternative to this would be planting a tree. As long as the tree is not burned, it will keep the carbon stored for a long time, with very little human input. </p>
<p>This will do nothing for pollution because they aren't exactly related. One is air quality and the particles in it, one is CO2. For air quality, NASA has done a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study" target="_blank">study</a> on that topic, and has a chart of good plants to keep in your house. Top two are the peace lily and chrysanthemums, but both of them are toxic to pets. If you have a furry friend, bamboo palm is a good option. </p></div></div>

Grass is one of a minority of plant species that use the C4 photosynthesis pathway, it is a relatively recently evolved photosynthesis pathway that is particularly efficient at extracting CO2 under drought conditions and in soil lacking nitrogen.</p>
<p>Grasses fixate 23% of Carbon despite representing just 5% of total plant biomass on Earth; they're almost 5 times better at carbon sequestration than most other, non-C4, plants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, C4 plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant biomass and 3% of its known plant species.[11][17] Despite this scarcity, they account for about 23% of terrestrial carbon fixation.[14][18]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, scientists have proposed that the rise of grasses was aided by a drastic drop atmospheric CO2 over the last 35 million years, and increased aridity and drought, the same drop in CO2 that helped usher in the last Ice Age. But did grass sequester CO2? Did it's expansion contribute to the drop in CO2? Interesting questions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Focus on what the plant is doing with the carbon it is liberating from CO2. It's using that to make more plant mass.</p>
<p>So, a faster growing plant that creates mass quickly (say Kudzu) will suck up a lot of carbon quickly. If sucking up carbon quickly is your aim, that's a good way to go.</p>
<p>Or you can just go for sheer volume of biomass. Phytoplankton has lots of room and is spread out across vast spaces, so it starts out with a huge mass. It will suck up huge volumes. Protecting phytoplankton should be a definite goal.</p>
<p>Big trees suck up a lot of carbon and hold onto it for decades to centuries, so they're a good way to keep it our of the atmosphere for a long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, to start, plants don't convert CO2 into O2. Instead, the O2 comes from H2O during the first step of the two-step process that is photosynthesis. The energy that's generated by this first step is then used in a second step to convert CO2 into carbohydrates. If you're curious how we know this, a famous study published in the 1940s (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01848a512?journalCode=jacsat&amp;quickLinkVolume=63&amp;quickLinkPage=877&amp;volume=63" target="_blank">here</a>) demonstrated you can introduce O2^18 isotopes into plants, either as CO2 or H2O, and see which one produces gaseous O2^18 at the end.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's all an aside. Another thing to mention is that the interchange of CO2 and O2 is pretty constant across all plants, with a near 1:1 efficiency ratio (one goes in, one comes out).</p>
<p>If you're looking instead for the efficiency of light to biomass (and consequently, most CO2 absorbed / O2 released per unit light), known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency" target="_blank">photosynthetic efficiency</a>, the most photosynthetically efficient plants are those which undergo something called C4 photosynthesis, which only 3% of land plants do. So probably one of those (caveat: as long as they're in their own environment; C4 plants like hot n' dry. Move 'em elsewhere and C3 outcompete 'em). </p>
<p>Of those plants whose conversion efficiency (that is, % of sunlight converted into biomass) has been thoroughly studied in the field, C4 plants hit as high as 3.7% across an entire growing season (or 4.3% at peak season; <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2417832?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">source #1</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1995.tb00565.x/full" target="_blank">source #2</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1941118?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">source #3</a>. Theoretical calculated efficiencies sit at around 6-7%), belonging to a few C4 grasses. Algae (such as cyanobacteria, which aren't actually plants) are actually fairly similar in their conversion rates, unless genetically engineered  - which they usually are when studied for efficiency; biofuel reactors n' all. </p>
<p>So, yup, the 'most effective' photosynthesisers seem to be C4 grasses. <a href="http://sippe.ac.cn/gh/2008%20Annual%20Report/Zhu%20X-G.pdf" target="_blank">This review</a> is pretty thorough, if you want more nitty gritty details!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
