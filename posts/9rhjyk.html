		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really, really great question, to which I’m seeing some real great answers here. The max number of electrons per orbital is always equal to two, and as others have stated, this is in fact due to the exclusion principle. </p>
<p>But, there’s a bit more that I think could be added here, about how we get the number of electrons corresponding to different subshells. That is to say: Yes, we know that orbitals are given by s, p, d, and f subshells, and we know that each of these can hold 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons, respectively. But where do <em>those</em> numbers come from?</p>
<p>To understand this, we need to understand two primary things: </p>
<p>One, is that electrons exhibit <em>wave-particle duality</em>—that is, they can behave simultaneously as a particle as well as a wave, depending on what you’re measuring. The reasons for this are outside the scope of this explanation, but are also a fascinating discussion on their own (see: Young’s double slit experiment)</p>
<p>Two, is the idea of a <em>standing wave</em>. A standing wave is a wave that appears to be standing still, rather than moving—<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Harmonic_Standing_Wave.gif" target="_blank">like the blue one in this gif</a>. In the gif, what you’re looking at is a <em>standing wave in one dimension</em>, i.e. a wave in a line.
The more energy a standing wave has, the more <a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/PHWZkAZfvIlrO/giphy.gif" target="_blank">nodes (points that don’t move, and stay at the x-axis)</a> it has; you can think of these as the “energy levels” of the wave (the lowest level having one peak/trough, the next up having two, and so on).</p>
<p>You can also have <a href="https://youtu.be/jhaTULO2Zkc" target="_blank">standing waves in two dimensions</a>(that is, a standing wave in a <em>plane</em>), which, you must admit, is a really pretty sight.
What’s of interest to us, however, is a <a href="https://youtu.be/EcKgJhFdtEY" target="_blank">three-dimensional standing wave</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you know all this, we can go on. Think of the electron as a 3-dimensional standing wave that surrounds the nucleus. As you increase this wave in energy, these 3D standing waves take on different shapes, which we call the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Spherical_Harmonics.png/800px-Spherical_Harmonics.png" target="_blank">spherical harmonics</a> (this is actually my desktop wallpaper!). As you might notice, each increasing energy level here gives us two more possible shapes; we start at 1, then 3, then 5, then 7, and so on. These are the shapes that the orbitals of electrons, which are really just 3D standing waves, will take; they correspond to the s, p, d, and f (and, I guess theoretically, g, and so on) orbitals.</p>
<p>Since we know that there can actually be <em>two</em> electrons with the same energy in a given atom (one spin up, and the other spin down) via the Pauli Exclusion Principle, we get that the s, p, d and f orbitals can contain 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons, respectively.</p>
<p>Note that this is still a vast oversimplification of the topic and there is still lots to talk about; however, I think this should suffice at a base level. In reality, the different shapes of 3D standing waves come from increasing the electron’s <em>angular</em> energy, but there are also <em>radial</em> energy levels that give us different types of s/p/d/f orbitals (such as 1s, 2s, 3s... and so on).</p>
<p>By the way, this is essentially where the idea of quantum mechanics originates from; that energy does not increase smoothly, but rather, can only take on specific energy levels or <em>quanta</em> (think the word <em>quantity</em>; it divides energy into individual, “countable” packets)</p>
<p>Edit: fixed some broken links. Also, thanks for the Au!</p>
<p>Edit 2: here’s a real good animation if you want a further visual understanding of what exactly is meant by a “standing wave”. <a href="https://youtu.be/ieheeeKTbac" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ieheeeKTbac</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Keep in mind that electrons behave as waves and their energies are associated with their wavelength. Each energy level can hold a limited set of energy &quot;modes&quot; defined by 4 quantum numbers. There isn't room for two electrons to have the same energy so they just won't fit in that state.</p>
<p>Edit: I have had some great questions that have already been answered by MagiMas and Hapankaali that you will see if you expand this post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
