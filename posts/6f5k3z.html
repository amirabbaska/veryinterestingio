		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Changing shirts is an issue of hygiene. Shirts get dirty faster. Food can fall on them. Bodily fluids. etc, etc get on your nice cotton shirts. If you wear the same shirt for 3 days straight it will start to smell and get gross.</p>
<p>A pair of jeans on the other hand, if you measure bacteria and dirt when you start wearing them, and then measure a month later very little has changed. Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat.</p>
<p>You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.</p>
<p>You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. </p>
<p>Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. </p>
<p>tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Armpit sweat tends to get to your shirts. And undergarments tend to protect your pants better from that sort of thing. So it's a bit less gross to repeat pants. Also depending on who you are pants tend to be more similar than shirts (you probably have a few not so different pairs  a of jeans) so people aren't as likely to notice repeated pants anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People can't tell if you're wearing the same pants because all pants usually look the same, whether it's jeans or trousers or whatever. People own multiple jeans, or multiple leggings. But people will know if you wear the same palm tree printed button up everyday </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much everyone wears some sort of underwear on their lower half, so your pants are pretty much guaranteed to have some shielding from personal filth.  Upper body on the other hand is relatively un-shielded, so you're dumping pit sweat into your shirt pretty much constantly.  </p>
<p>As an extra way to fuck with people, I literally own a few dozen pairs of the same pants. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
