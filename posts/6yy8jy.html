		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has something to do with R.E.M. Sleep Cycles. Essentially, you're waking up during the lighter stage of your sleep cycle, which means you don't feel the groggy effects of waking during deep sleep. </p>
<p>I'm sure someone smarter can expand on hormone release during the cycle that also has an effect. </p>
<p>TLDR: You're not in as much of a deep sleep as you would be following a full nights sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes through sleep cycles that last average around 90 minutes each. More or less depending on how long you've been asleep. I started setting my alarm to wake me up at exactly the end of a cycle and you'd be surprised to see hoe much easier it is to get up. Besides lack of sleep, most people feel froggy in the morning because they wake up in the middle of a cycle. </p>
<p>So for example if you go to bed at 10 (if you are a person tbat normally falls asleep within a few minutes) you would have to get up at either 5:30, 7 or 8:30. Waking up at 6 would interrupt a cycle and disrupt your morning.</p>
<p>I use a sleep app that tells me when is the best time to wake up based on what time Im going to bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I don't have access to the specifics . I remember that power napping business executive craze of the 1980s was no less than 16 minutes and no more than 19 minutes.  Less was not enough to produce results and more committed you to the sleep.   The problem with the morning sleeping was phrased as the possibility of &quot;sleep inertia&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
