		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has been answered accurately already so I'm gonna try to do a better job of explaining it to a 5 year old. </p>
<p>When you talk, there are &quot;strings&quot; (not actual strings, more like folds) in your neck called vocal cords that make the talking sound. The faster they move (or vibrate), the higher the sound they make. Children's voices sound higher than adult voices because children's vocal cords aren't as big, so they're able to vibrate faster and make a higher pitched sound.</p>
<p>The same thing happens if you take that sound and play it even faster. You're artificially making the vibrations of the sound move faster so it sounds higher pitched. </p>
<p>This is true of any sound, not just voices. </p>
<p><strong><em>Edit</em></strong>: In case I simplified too much... here's a longer answer for anyone who wants to go a bit deeper, or who wants to complain about slight technical misunderstandings of what my simplified explanation meant:</p>
<p>When vocal cords are smaller they naturally vibrate faster when air is pushed by them, which means the frequency of the audiowave pattern they produced gets repeated quicker. That's the frequency, which determines how high we hear its sound. The faster something vibrates, the higher pitched it is. </p>
<p>You do the same thing when you take a recording and run it faster. You increase the frequency of the audiowave pattern, so the pitch gets shifted up. </p>
<p>So the &quot;Explain it like I'm 18 and just haven't taken physics for some reason&quot; answer is that in audio, pitch = frequency, and frequency = wavespeed / wavelength. If you speed up the wavespeed without changing the wavelength, you get a higher frequency, which equals higher pitch. </p>
<p>But that answer had already been given when I wrote this, so I went for something a little more illustrative, and a lot of people seemed to find it more helpful.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final edit</em></strong> For accuracy I adjusted some words and added some notes in parentheses. I originally talked about the length of the vocal cords instead of just overall size, which, while accurate, is not AS accurate, and just seemed to confuse the issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has explained frequency and /u/AssaultedCracker even brought up vocal cords, but nobody has explained why bringing up the frequency makes things sound <em>unnaturally</em> high pitched (not just as if a singer were singing higher), so let me cover that.</p>
<p>When we talk or sing, the sound we produce is made by two things: first, the vocal cords make a pitch, or a basic tone. Then the rest of the inside of the mouth and throat <em>filter</em> that sound, emphasizing some parts (frequencies) and getting rid of others. This is how we can tell vowels like &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; apart: the basic pitch may be the same, but by moving our mouth and tongue we change the resulting sound that comes out. If you've ever brought a glass or cup to your ear and listened as you move it closer and closer and eventually seal it off, you've experienced filtering. The cup changes which frequencies are emphasized or removed and things sound strange.</p>
<p>In general, males have larger &quot;filters&quot; (mouth and throat) than females and kids have smaller ones. The larger the filter, the lower the general frequencies. This is why male voices sound deeper and kids' voices sound higher pitched. The range of the vocal cords also changes, but a guy and a girl may be singing the same note and yet the guy will still sound deeper on average.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that when we sing higher or lower the basic pitch changes (the note our vocal cords make), but the rest stays the same: the filter still filters the same frequencies. But when we speed up a recording, we're not only changing the base pitch but also everything else, including the effects of the filter. And so, slowing down a recording of a woman makes her sound more like a man, and speeding it up makes her sound more like a kid. And if you go high enough, it'll start sounding like a Smurf, which is what we've come to associate with unnaturally sped up human voices.</p>
<p>This component of speech besides the base pitch is called the <em>formants</em>. Speeding up audio shifts the formants up higher in frequency. And that's why speeding up a voice makes it sound funny and high pitched. Specialized software (like Melodyne) can be used to edit this, changing the pitch of a voice without altering the formants or the tempo, or any other combination of those. For example, GlaDOS from the Portal games is a female voice that was edited to &quot;autotune&quot; the pitch but also with the formants shifted higher to make her sound oddly childish and robotic. Similarly, the stereotypical &quot;bad guy voice&quot; in games is often just a voice with the formants brought way lower with digital editing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound waves. When you speed up a playback, it shortens the duration between the sound waves, resulting in a higher frequency and thus a higher pitched sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Pitch, noun: the degree of inclination or slope; angle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in &quot;pitched roof&quot;.  When you have waves like this:</p>
<pre><code>    _       _
  _/ \_   _/ \_
_/     \_/     \_</code></pre>
<p>with time along the bottom axis, and you squeeze the time, you get this:</p>
<pre><code>  /\    /\
 /  \  /  \
/    \/    \</code></pre>
<p>So you've <strong>literally</strong>, by the above definition, increased the pitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
