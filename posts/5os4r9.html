<p>If the US stops paying its debts as planned, folks are going to stop buying their bonds.  Should they ever want to raise cash through debt again, nobody's going to buy their bonds again without some kind of (expensive) garauntee.  </p>
<p>A large-scale example is Dubai in the UAE.  Seeing their oil reserves drying up, the royal family started converting their largest city into THE Muslim tourist destination.  Turns out after certain world events Muslim folks don't always feel welcome in Paris or Disneyworld.  They set out to build 7-star resorts, rediculous luxury activities, some of the tallest towers in the world, and even fabricated whole designer islands.  </p>
<p>At first this was all financed by the royal family, but as that cash dried up they sought out foreign investors.  When they started having cash flow issues due to a lack of tourists, they simply stopped paying debts.  Tons of people got hosed, but as you said nobody can really repossess a whole country, and invading a small non-militant country is really bad mojo on the world stage.  So almost overnight Dubai's construction progress virtually halted, as nobody was lending to fund further development.  </p>
<p>Another consideration is that world debt brings world peace.  The US famously owes China trillions. That means we're paying trillions worth of interest payments each year in debt service.  Should we go to war with China, you can pretty much garauntee that we'd cut those payments off the first day and zero the debt in our books.  That's a massive blow to Chinese income, so whatever they're willing to go to literal war over would have to be worth the hit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>They pay to bondholders, who bought US treasury bonds. Every once in awhile, the US (or other country) essentially hold an auction, and people who want to buy bonds, do so. After buying them, they'll get paid back according to the return on the bond</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whom do they owe to?
It depends on the country, but most owe it to citizens, and some foreigners. If i recall, ~60-70% of the U.S debt is owed by US citizens. </p>
<p>Most important, whats the need for US to be paying back its not that someone is going to come and foreclose.</p>

<p>Mainly in order to be able to borrow in the future. As a sovereign nation, they can basically tell creditors they're screwed, and there's not much anyone can do to stop that. However, this would obviously hurt people's trust in the countries' ability to pay in the future, and they'll have a harder time selling bonds in the future (usually they can still sell bonds, but they have to offer nicer terms to make up for the chance they're going to screw creditors again).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whom do i pay?
While you can't buy out the bonds directly * , there is a form on your taxes where you can pay more than you owe to the Treasury.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>technically it depends on the bond. Some have buyout clauses, though you would have to pay extra for the privilege. but especially in the U.S. case, they don't <em>want</em> to be paid back early. It's safe, free profit for them (although the return is rather low. iirc Treasuries right now are going for something like .5-1.5% . better than nothing though)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bondholders, which means you technically can't pay the debt off early.  </p>
<p>When the US borrows money, they hold an auction, in which people give them 10,000 (usually in large multiples of $10,000) for the right to receive a few interest payments per year and $10,000 when the bond matures.  These bondholders can be almost anyone (it's likely tough for Cubans to collect) and the bonds can be resold on the secondary markets.  The US collectively owes whomever owns the bonds at any given moment (which includes almost everyone via mutual funds that own at least a few bonds).  </p>
<p>The US pays its debts because it wishes to maintain it's stellar credit rating (the US has never defaulted on a debt in it's entire history).  That means when the US wants to borrow money, nearly everyone in the world is interested in lending money to the US.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, who owns the national debt? A pretty large part of it, about 20% is actually just one department of the government owing money to other departments. It's not unusual for one department to borrow money from other departments in order to fill in budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>The next 40% or so is held by US citizens and companies. These are in the form of US Treasury Bonds, which are a type of savings bonds that anyone can buy. If you own the bond, the government owed you that amount of money with interest, due on the date the bond matures.</p>
<p>The remaining 40% or so is owned by a mix of foreign governments, companies, and individuals. This is also in the form of Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>In theory, you could go out and buy $10 Trillion dollars worth of these bonds from anyone willing to sell them and then formally forgive the debt. I'm not sure what this process would entail, but it might be as simple as destroying the bonds. It could be much more complicated though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can just pay the US treasury, <a href="https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/23779454" target="_blank">they have Pay.gov</a> to let you do it, they accept credit, debit, ACH, paypal and check via mail.</p>
<p>In practice, as others said, it's not instant, they technically put it into a fund reserved for paying off bond holders, and the treasury pays out as they come due, if it was $10 trillion I'm sure lawmakers would find a way to withdraw it before the treasury pays down that debt.</p>
<p>As for forclosure, not possible, a bond is something that says &quot;I owe you $x on this date&quot;, if you say you want it back early, they don't really have to pay. And if the US did default, there isn't really anything anyone can do about it, the US government controls their bonds, and there isn't any higher authority they answer to (unless you count the rest of the world going to war over it). In practice, it's bad for the US if it happens, if they failed to pay it, the mutual funds owning the bonds would simply end up zeroing out the bonds that went unpaid, vaporizing money out of the fund, and everyone with a retirement account would be upset about losing money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
