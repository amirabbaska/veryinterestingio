		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaving the lid on increases the humidity in the space above the liquid. The increased humidity slows the evaporation of the water, which allows bubbles to grow larger before the liquid in the bubble thins out sufficiently for the bubble to burst. The collection of large bubbles appear as a foam layer.</p>
<p>When you take the lid out, the humidity in the space above the liquid falls. Evaporation becomes faster, and the bubbles burst before it gets large, leading to a thinner foam layer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the first questions you have to answer are what causes the bubbles and why do they pop?  The bubbles are formed by the water vapor that's boiling up through the water in your pot.  The water's surface tension doesn't break right away so you get a bubble.  It grows as more steam enters through the bottom surface and pops when the pressure inside the bubble becomes too great for the bubble to contain.  Except it's not just the pressure inside the bubble that counts; the pressure outside the bubble matters too.  It's the <em>difference</em> between the inner and outer pressures that is limited by the strength of the bubble.</p>
<p>The other commenters are correct that the starch from the pasta increases the surface tension of the water, so right away you have bubbles that will naturally grow bigger and take longer to pop.  But what, specifically, changes when you put the lid on?  The lid actually does a pretty good job of sealing the opening of the pot so it is difficult for the rising steam to escape.  With the steam unable to escape easily the space between the water and the lid starts to pressurize.  In this pressurized space the bubbles experience a much higher &quot;outer&quot; pressure than they did with the lid off, so the inner pressure of each bubble has to grow that much greater for the bubbles to pop.  Thus you start to get very large and long-lasting bubbles forming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're heating the water, it will soon get off a lot of the starch that is in the pasta or potatoes you're cooking. Now, the starch will make the bubbles that nucleate in the water much more resilient once they surface. Normally, bubbles are quite weak and pop immediatly in the open air.<br />
However, once touching the cool air on the top, the hot air would like to take in a little more space then its cool counterpart. Hot air does this everywhere in the world, thats actually why we have weather. But thats for another question.<br />
Now, when the bubble expands it will break. But if you put a lid on the pot, there is no reason why this should happen, the surrounding air is just as hot as the air in the bubbles. So now, the old bubbles get pushed up by new bubbles from below until they finally reach the top of the pot and push the lid up temporarily for small amounts of time, enough so that some pressure/bubbles/hot air can be released until the lid comes down again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
