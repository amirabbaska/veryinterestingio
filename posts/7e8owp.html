		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand why solar-powered stirling engines are not used in the power station size, but why aren't solar-powered turbines used in homes? The concept of using the sun to build up pressure and turn something with enough mechanical work to turn a motor seems pretty simple.</p>
<p>So why aren't these seemingly simple devices used in homes? Even though a solar-powered stirling engine has limitations, it could technically work too, right? </p>
<p>I apologize for my question format. I am tired, am very confused, and my Google-fu is proving weak.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: Thank you for the awesome responses!</p>
<p><strong>edit 2</strong>: To sum it up for anyone finding this post in the future: Maintenance, part complexity, noise, and price.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a solar engineer, but here's a physics-based argument:</p>
<p><strong>You can't get a solar heat absorbing panel hot enough to match the efficiency of photovoltaic solar panels, unless you use lenses and mirrors which track the sun.</strong></p>
<p>Math: the efficiency of any engine that converts heat into useful power is limited by the &quot;Carnot efficiency&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>   max eff = (T_hot - T_cold) / T_hot</code></pre>
<p>where T_hot and T_cold are the temperatures of the heat source and heat sink, in <em>Kelvin</em>.  Real-world devices can come close, but can't exceed this limit: <a href="http://www.brighthubengineering.com/power-plants/72369-compare-the-efficiency-of-different-power-plants/" target="_blank">typical large-scale power plants</a> can get to within 2/3 of it.</p>
<p>Typical photovoltaic solar panels operate at about <a href="https://sciencing.com/average-photovoltaic-system-efficiency-7092.html" target="_blank">15% efficiency</a>.  To match that with a heat engine running at 2/3 of the Carnot efficiency, and a cooling system running at 27°C (typical outside air temperature), you'd need the &quot;hot side&quot; of your engine running at 115°C.  That's right around the boiling point of water.</p>
<p>The problem is, you can't get a container of water that hot just by putting it out in the sun.  Even in a vacuum-sealed black-painted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_collector" target="_blank">solar thermal collector</a>, when you get up to these temperatures, the amount of infrared light radiated away from the hot collector equals the amount of sunlight coming in, so very little or no heat is left to send to the engine.</p>
<p>To get up to an efficiency that beats photovoltaics, you'd need to dramatically increase the ratio of solar absorbing area to infrared-emitting area, which means lenses or mirrrors to capture and concentrate sunlight.  These devices would have to move to track the sun...</p>
<p>So now you're looking at running a turbine (about as mechanically complicated, noisy, and high-maintenance as a car engine), in a system with boiling water (noisy, safety hazard), with a complicated optical tracking system on the roof (prone to break down, needs to be kept clean of leaves and bird poop).... even if you could make it cheap, it'd be a homeowner's nightmare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all comes down to return on investment and cost of maintenance. The best way to limit maintenance is to eliminate moving parts. Moving parts vibrate and wear. PV panels can be installed and besides cleaning go untouched for 30 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the short answer is that regular solar panels are efficient and simple enough that many more people are investing in them which is driving down cost. Even a simple solar turbine would have moving parts which could fail and would require some maintenance from time to time. I haven’t done any research into whether the turbine would be more efficient, but they are obviously not efficient enough to justify further development. At least not yet. Another factor could be investment cost, and size of the equipment. Panels are easy to scale in size, and don’t cost a lot of money upfront to get power straight out. I’m guessing a solar turbine that could power your house would be more expensive up front.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There used to be a company called Infinia Corporation that made solar Stirling engines that looked like satellite dishes, with about 24% efficiency. They're gone now, as far as I can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ekSS8C_vvSs" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to a video about them. They looked cool but unfortunately they're no longer in business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
