		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider your feeling of a persons &quot;attractiveness&quot; as a unconscious evaluation of that persons health, success, ability to take care of him/her self, potential as a mate etc etc. </p>
<p>These are really only relevant in the initial stages of a relationship. As you get to know them further you get more information from other sources than looks and your relationship (whatever it is) becomes more established. The relevancy of your attractiveness rating becomes diminished and it is therefore no longer benificial for you to judge them as harsly in either direction. </p>
<p>For example: &quot;Attractiveness&quot; can be a good tool for figuring out which potential mate it is best to invest time &amp; resources in on limited information. But once you're in a commited relationship judging the attractiveness of your partner as harsly is less relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you meet a really really good looking person for the first time, the only thing you know about them is their looks. Since that's all you know about them, you will first think, &quot;Wow, they're really really good looking. Every other part of them must be just as good looking.&quot; But, after a while, you start talking to them and getting to know who they are. And maybe from those interactions, you begin to find out, &quot;Oh, maybe they're not as great after all.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you meet a very ugly person for the first time, you will first think, &quot;Ew, this person is ugly! Gross! Every other part of them must be ugly too!&quot; But, after a while, you might start talking to them and getting to know them too. And maybe from those interactions, you begin to find out, &quot;I was wrong, this person is actually pretty cool!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if you weren't five, I'd say it's all about first impressions and either holding high or low expectations of a person purely based on looks. Getting to know people over time changes those impressions and depending where you first hold them, it's easier to go to the opposite side.</p>
<p>However, this phenomenon isn't always true. You'll meet people in life who can be both attractive on the outside and inside as well as ugly on the outside and inside. Everyone's different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the ugly people it's called mere-exposure effect. Things you often see seem to be prettier over time.
I think attractive people are kind of intimidating and you are to shy to see their flaws in the beginning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people are people. The more you get to know them, the more you empathize with them. </p>
<p>I dunno if there's a scientific answer, but guess and personal experience has been, that really beautiful people have a &quot;glass shattering&quot; moment when they do something gross/awkward like fart, or have a high-pitched voice, or can't get it up. Y'know, beautiful people problems. </p>
<p>If someone is ugly but you spend more time with them, you bond. And that bond may make you feel closer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also when you first meet someone a particular part may really impress our repulse you but mere enclosure desensitizes you to that part. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
