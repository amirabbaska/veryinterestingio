		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. “UVA radiation is what makes people tan. UVA rays penetrate to the lower layers of the epidermis, where they trigger cells called melanocytes (pronounced: mel-an-oh-sites) to produce melanin. Melanin is the brown pigment that causes tanning. Melanin is the body's way of protecting skin from burning.” </p>
<p>Your cells bee to be active in order to create a tan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Melanin is a pigment that is secreted in response to UV radiation by a type of cell in the body called a melanocyte. Once a person dies and blood flow ceases, all cells will soon die without nutrients, oxygen, and waste removal, including melanocytes. If a dead person were to &quot;change color&quot; after being exposed to the elements, I'd imagine its due to decomposition and necrosis, or even being physically burnt by the sun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So UV light damages your cells in pretty specific ways. The most detrimental effect is by damaging DNA.</p>
<p>DNA is just a giant molecule and many molecules absorb light at specific wavelengths. You can think of this similar to a tuning fork or guitar string. If you play a note that matches its tuning next to it, the guitar string or tuning fork will start to vibrate itself.</p>
<p>For DNA, this magic not is the UV wavelengths (within 200-300nm). This in a sense causes the DNA molecule to &quot;vibrate&quot; itself as it absorbs the energy. This in turn can cause it to break in specific areas which are not always repaired correctly.</p>
<p>This damage is how UV light can cause mutations that lead to cancer and the damage also is recognized by the immune system which has to clear out cells that are too damaged to be repaired. This redirects blood flow to the skin which is why you turn red, etc.</p>
<p>Specific cells within the skin called melanocytes can also sense UV radiation and respond by producing a variety of melanins which are pigments that also absorb UV light and appear brown in color to the eye. They work by helping absorb the excess energy from UV radiation so that DNA isn't taking the brunt of the blow.</p>
<p>All of these processes are very specifically and purposefully executed by living cells. If a person was dead, none of them would occur. Being exposed to UV light would just further damage already dead cells and not produce many of the reactions we commonly associate with sunburn and tanning.</p>
<p>Hopefully this answers some of the other questions that arose in the comments section. Disclaimer: this is a bit of an oversimplification </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. All that will happen is it will dry out faster, and if it's hot enough it may just cook.
once the person dies any and all bodily functions will stop. This includes the function that causes the inflamation in a sun burn. tanning is just a reaction to that inflamation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
