		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As explained by several here there were numerous contraceptive methods. Abortions existed in various forms, though their risk and effectiveness was rather varied. Taken early many herbal concoctions (read; poisons) could induce a miscarriage, assuming the pregnancy had not in itself already miscarried anyways (the most common form of 'abortion' is a nonviable embryo or fetus being flushed out; often perceived as little more than a late period)</p>
<p>There was also, of course, temples. Virgin Births have always been a staple of religions (as has resurrection for anything demideity or above). The common claim to avoid any stigma from young unwed mothers was that Zeus did it. These children would be left to the temple, and while everyone understood what's really going on (except for some of the more naive) given the circumstances often involved it was extremely uncouth to not at least pretend.</p>
<p>Later on this was replaced to a degree by convents. Girls caught &quot;embarrassing&quot; their families would be sent to the nunnery, where many would presumably discover a poor orphaned baby a few months down the road after a miracle diet. My own grandmother had extensive experience as a midwife for the nearby convent in 1930s canada: Many nuns would come to her small town for a 'spiritual retreat' from the larger cities and return after they'd lost some weight, discovering a poor abandoned child alongside the road. While it was more often first-time nuns visiting, she had some rather dedicated regulars. In some cases that was a bit of a problem; there historically has been much abuse of nuns by the clergy. Yes, that kind of abuse (estimated 40% of nuns)</p>
<p>It was ... impolite to point out simple facts among the congregation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pennyroyal tea was used in England. Also the prostitutes developed a technique where they would butter up their thighs and &quot;trick&quot; the man into using their legs while not penetrating the vagina. This was touched on in the book/movie &quot;From Hell&quot; about Jack the Ripper.</p>
<p>Edit: source </p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Alan Moore's notes for his own From Hell:</p>
<p>The trick by which a prostitute would hold the penis between her thighs to simulate intercourse without penetration was allegedly a common one during the period (and unfortunately recorded in a source that I am presently unable to trace) stated that during twenty years working as a prostitute in the East End of London, she had only been penetrated twice the rest of the time fobbing the customer with the trick...'

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Victorian England, sex outside would often take the place standing up (to prevent clothing becoming dirty) with the man behind the woman (known as a &quot;thruppenny upright&quot;* - &quot;thruppenny&quot; meaning &quot;three pennnies&quot; which is what it cost). The woman could (ideally if the man was drunk) hold is penis between her thighs rather than actually entering her to avoid pregnancy.</p>
<p>*On a related note there was some coded language when soliciting sex. A man may explain to a women that he &quot;wished to get to hairyfordshire, but only had thruppence (i.e. three pence) for the fare... For a prostitute this would obviously be a request for sex, but could otherwise (if necessary) be innocently explained as a request for money to pay for the fare to get to the county of Herefordshire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Abortions have always been a thing, they were just pretty unsafe and could either kill you or lead to sterility. Different herbs have been used as birth control or to induce miscarriage. Sometimes animal intestines or treated linen were used as condoms until rubber condoms were made in the 1850s. You can still buy lambskin condoms if you have a latex allergy. Some cultures used different things to block semen, like sponges, citrus peels, crocodile poop, etc.  </p>
<p>Edit: Yes people, crocodile poop. Form a little cup, let it dry, you've got yourself a proto-diaphragm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know in the 19th century here in America, in the Five Points area of New York specifically, women would put pennies up their vaginas. It sounds strange until you realize that the modern day Paragard IUD is copper and copper is effective at creating an abortifacient environment.</p>
<p>That being said: the modern day Paragard works in the uterus and I don't believe they could shove a penny past their cervix so I don't know the efficacy of said penny method.</p>
<p>In brothels, at least, there were indeed children, though normally kept in the private living areas, not in the...erm... Business areas. Prostitutes did get pregnant. And I believe there were herbal remedies (not good for you ones) that they'd use to try to induce miscarriage or abortion... I don't know too much about that, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
