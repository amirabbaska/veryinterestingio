		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is one big muscle. The entire tube that is your GI tract has smooth muscle around it from your esophagus all the way to your anus. Once food gets into your intestines (large or small) there is something known as peristalsis (this happens elsewhere too, but let's focus on just the intestines). Wikipedia has a great <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Peristalsis.gif" target="_blank">simplified image</a> of what it looks like. Basically a point in the tube contracts while the point ahead of it relaxes which allows material inside the tube to move forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While similar to peristalsis, the large intestine (colon) does not propagate contents the same way as the small intestine.  It uses what are termed &quot;mass movements&quot;, or bulk flow.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peristalsis. There are different layers of epithelium and muscles in our large intestinal wall and the two particular layers are the longitudinal and circular muscle. Within them there are two different neuron plexus: submucosal and myenteric plexus, one help with secretion and one help with movement.
When the food bolus/chyme reaches your large intestine, that mechanical triggering (having food brush up your LI) the neuronal plexus to send signals your brain and your GI, the brain and your GI then tells your muscles to move. Brain: PNS, GI: ENS (That itself is a whole another lecture)
Remember the two layer of muscles I talked about (longitudinal and circular)? Circular muscle is closer to the bolus than longitudinal muscle (don't forget they're layers). So Circular muscle contract and longitudinal relaxes to push the food forward near the oral surface while circular relaxes and longitudinal contract to hold the LI open on the aboral side. It is through these that generate the peristalsis movement which propel the food forward!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/3.082/www/team1_f02/pictures/serosa.jpg" target="_blank">Check out a cross section of the intestine</a>.  That pink layer is smooth muscle, mostly under involuntary control.  Both the small and large intestine have this layer.  </p>
<p>This is similar to how blood is shuttled through arteries.  <a href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4fqoeB57m1rq3lp6o1_500.jpg" target="_blank">Notice the media layer, which is made up of smooth muscle.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your GI tract has a nervous system all of its own! It probably predates the enlarged ganglion we call a &quot;brain&quot; by a considerable period of geologic time. Stuff that is ingested is pushed along the tube within your middle from mouth to anus by a neural plexus and ganglia that rhythmically squeeze the contents in a pattern that moves things along from mouth to anus. You are not aware of this process unless something goes wrong, we call it &quot;autonomic&quot; but it is independent of the 'brain' and predates the brain in an evolutionary sense. Some unfortunate persons have a GI tract that does not perform the action of peristalsis normally, and they will suffer from symptoms that vary from mild to fatal. </p>
<p>So bow down to the ancient gut nervous system, it serves you every time you eat or drink and expect to get a benefit from that action -- but if it is nonfunctional in some way, may the Lord have Mercy upon your suffering soul!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
