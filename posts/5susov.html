		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A more aerodynamic shape would help fuel efficiency some, but not that much for two reasons. First, buses don't travel that fast and drag (air resistance in this case) becomes a bigger deal at higher velocity. </p>
<p>Second, there are two different types of drag: drag from pushing air out of the way and drag from air passing over the surface of the vehicle. For a short car, there isn't much surface for air to pass over so pretty much all of the drag comes from pushing air out of the way. That's also the sort of drag an aerodynamic shape helps with. For a long vehicle like a bus, drag from air passing over its surface area is a bigger deal. There's still more overall drag on a bus from having to push air out of the way, but skin drag is a much bigger component than it is for cars. This makes the drag from having to push air out of the way in the front less important for buses.</p>
<p>Those are just reasons why an aerodynamic shape won't help a bus as much, though; they're not reasons to not do it. The reason buses are designed with a flat front is that it maximizes volume and a flat front and window allow the driver to see better, especially when turning. The increased space and visibility are more important than any small increase in efficiency from a more aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Buses benefit less from aerodynamics because of their long shape and they would be hurt by a more aerodynamic shape because a flat front maximizes space and driver visibility.</p>
<p>Edit: In response to the multiple comments saying that some buses go fast, we know that. But most buses do not and when buses are designed it's usually not clear exactly how they'll be used. And even for the ones that get on the freeway, the flat front is better for volume and for turning once the bus inevitably leaves the freeway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interior space efficiency is more important than exterior aerodynamic profile in busses as they generally travel at low speed. Aerodynamic drag increases as the square of velocity, so at low speeds it is less important. A more aerodynamic nose shape generally requires an overall &quot;pointier&quot; shape, which means you can generally fit less into it inside. This space could be used to fit more seats, so the bus can haul more people in the same foorprint. So at a low speed where aerodynamic drag is almost negligible, interior packaging profile is prioritized. It's also a maintenance issue. Flat parts are also easy and cheap to both make and replace, much more so than contoured aerodynamic shapes. Busses hit things and get hit fairly often, so having cheap exterior panels is a big plus. Long haul and tour busses that travel for extended times at speed make more of an effort at aerodynamics, by adding some rake angle to the forward face and having more contoured panels. But the lower the speed the bus operates at, the higher the priority of packaging and ease of construction/maintenance, hence simple flat faced city busses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamics took a back seat to maneuverability on downtown streets where corners tend to be more square and congested. If transit buses were built like school buses the nose would swing way into oncoming traffic when making turns. Flat front buses have the front wheels behind the driver and closer to the rear axle so the turning radius is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Source: drove city bus for five years, like flat fronts more.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and front wheel tweak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All vehicles have a maximum design length, width, and height. </p>
<p>A bus's primary purpose is to transport as many people as possible, fuel efficiency is much further down the list. </p>
<p>Buses are designed to have the largest volume you can drive safely on most roads without special consideration.  That's why they're low-riding boxes on wheels.  </p>
<p>Designers do their best on fuel efficiency through the motor, but aerodynamics at sub-40mph are really negligible anyway.  Carving out triangles to gain aerodynamic efficiency is taking away from storage, seating, or engine space, which is the whole reason your customer bought the bus in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
