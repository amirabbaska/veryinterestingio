<p>Is my laundry soap markedly different from what my mother used? Or what her mother used? Have there been revolutionary steps forward? What were they?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Worked at major FMCG producing Laundry Detergents, calculating costs of various formulas. Some considerations: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are ingredients that add absolutely nothing to cleaning e.g. green / blue speckles, perfumes (if you follow up with fabric enhancer with its own scent).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the same brand powder formula is stronger than liquid which is stronger than spray. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional products (marketed for hotels, restaurants) will typically be stronger, contain a lot of whitener (that's why hotel bedsheets look so fresh) and no perfume. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies are pushing liquids mostly for marketing (nice transparent bottles with colorful liquid) or ease of
use (powder tend to convert to granules in high moisture environment, leaving white &quot;stains&quot; on fabric) purposes </p>
</li>
<li>There were four major innovations in last 50 years:
a) Compaction - either liquid concentrates or pouches.
b) Long lasting scent - small chemical compounds releasing scent after fabric is physically touched.
c) Optical brighteners  - enhance color contrast (which can also reveal old stains you wouldn't see otherwise)
d) Addition of large variety of enzymes - enzyme deals with particular type of stain (blood, grass, chocolate etc.)</li>
<li>Formulas can be different per country. Some local formulas contain enzymes dealing with stains coming from local food (e.g. beetroot). </li>
<li>
<p>Germany has the strongest formulas in Europe because:
a) Germans do not overdose - typical behavior of Eastern European consumers
b) Germans have strong, highly regarded consumer research companies.
Also a lot of products are initially launched in Germany. If they succeed there they will succeed elsewhere as well. </p>
</li>
<li>All major market players reverse engineer formulas of competitors, knowing exactly what's inside. If they want to make a claim they have the best formula on the market, they will improve it just slightly (say, 5%) and go ahead with advertising.</li>
<li>A lot of laundry detergents or stain removers have &quot;sensitive&quot; formulas, meaning nothing else than dilution of cleaning power.  </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If anything, they have gotten worse from a cleaning perspective. With the elimination of phosphates out of detergent, the cleaning power of the various detergents has dropped dramatically. </p>
<p>On the flip side, our waterways and the effluent from our sewage treatment plants is a lot less damaging. If you don't care about that kind of thing, toss a teaspoon of Tri Sodium Phospahte into your laundry and see the difference it makes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They changed a lot. For example most detergents do have an enzyme compound and therefore work best at temperatures below 40C.  A typical error in cleaning is using the wrong water temperature. But it depends. The real question should be if you need a much better detergent if the old one works fine ;-).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Washing machines and laundry detergent have co-evolved and so have dish washers and their cleaners. Less energy, less water, cleaner outcome. Formulated products are complex and so provide many opportunities for 'tweaking'. Most are incremental, some are large as in the examples I offered. Today's products no longer rely on phosphates which are banned due to water pollution and yet work just as well using newly developed equivalents. Some old-fashioned products help too. Consider adding borax to hot water to get chlorine-free bleaching or washing soda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
