		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dominant&quot; and &quot;recessive&quot; simply describe how two <em>alleles</em> interact with each other. A dominant allele may be <em>disadvantageous</em>- in which case it would slowly die out. It might simply be rarer- when most of the population has recessive alleles, the dominant allele doesn't increase in number as quickly.</p>
<p>That's the simple description- let's look at it closely!</p>
<h2>Alleles</h2>
<p>The DNA of humans (like most animals) is paired up. We have two copies of each gene. Each copy doesn't have to be the same, too, and we can have two different versions of the same gene.</p>
<p>Each version of a gene is called an <em>allele</em>.</p>
<h2>Dominance</h2>
<p>When an allele is <em>dominant</em>, the organism takes on that trait even if it has another <em>recessive</em> allele. For example, there are 3 alleles that determine your ABO blood group: A, B, and O. A and B are co-dominant, and O is recessive.</p>
<p>So if you have one A allele and one O allele, your blood type would be A. A is dominant over O. Similarly, B is dominant over O, and having one B and one O allele would give you a B blood type.</p>
<h2>Frequency</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, the O blood type- two O alleles- is much more common in human populations. Why?</p>
<p>In this case, having A/B/AB/O blood types doesn't really affect your life. You wouldn't expect someone with an AB blood type to be more successful in life than someone with O, for example.</p>
<p>Thus over the generations, there isn't any pressure that makes people with O blood less successful. So if a population starts out with a lot of O blood people, chances are that two people meeting and having kids will both be O type- and all their kids will be O type.</p>
<p>So it just happened that we started out with relatively lots of O type people, and the proportion stayed that way!</p>
<p>The same goes for having many fingers on each hand. It's simply much more common to find 5-fingered people, even though having 6 fingers is a dominant trait.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose a mom flower is red and if bred with other red flowers produces only red offspring.  This is called 'true breeding' because no other colors pop out of these pairings.</p>
<p>Suppose a dad flower is yellow and if bred with other yellow flowers produces only yellow offspring.</p>
<p>Imagine an offspring flower that inherits one color gene variant from its true breeding red mom parent and one color gene variant from its true beeding yellow dad parent.</p>
<p>A flower cannot be both pure red and pure yellow, so this situation has to resolve somehow.  If the offspring turn out red, we say red is dominant to yellow.</p>
<p>The offspring has a yellow gene variant, but it is not expressed because the dominant red variant overrides it.</p>
<p>Now, to answer your question:</p>
<p>Dominance has nothing to do with the frequency of the gene.  Suppose there are 7 billion flowers on the earth, but only 10 of them have the red variant.  Well those 10 will certainly be red, but it's not common.</p>
<p>What happens in the next generation?</p>
<p>The offspring of the red flowers will also be red.  But if the red flowers bred with yellow partners (likely), they will also carry the yellow allele.  When they have offspring of their own, there is a 50% chance that they will pass on the yellow gene variant rather than the red.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't the red allele slowly increase in frequency and become fixed in the population?</p>
<p>Well, what if yellow flowers prefer yellow mates to red mates?</p>
<p>What if a predator (a bird, say) can see red flowers more easily than yellow?</p>
<p>What if the red gene variant also causes failure to thrive?</p>
<p>Or, what if there is nothing giving one a particular advantage over the other?  In that case which becomes more common than it was in previous generations  is more or less a matter of chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
