Many On- and Off- premise chains are asking for this information before bringing in any beers.  The brewery I work for has nutrition facts on our core, year round beers.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because historically as a country/society we decided that non-hard alcohol is neither a food (which would require at least a calorie listing) nor a drug (which would require a dosage listing). </p>
<p>Meanwhile we do enforce things like the following:
&quot;Battle has rejected a beer label for the King of Hearts, which had a playing card image on it, because the heart implied that the beer would have a health benefit.&quot;</p>

However non-alcoholic beverages and other food products are all regulated by a different part of the US government called the FDA (Food and drug administration) and products regulated by them must adhere to a different set of rules like posting ingredients and nutritional information on the packaging. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grant also took on the Federal Government. As he —and we fellow maltworms— knew, beer is liquid bread. So, he asked, in 1992, why shouldn't there be nutritional information on beer labels? In answer, he put nutritional specifications on six-pack carriers of his Scottish Ale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the government didn't agree with his assessment. </p>
<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) determined that putting nutritional information on a beer label might confuse consumers into thinking that beer actually had nutritional value, just as, say, a Twinkie might, which is required to have a nutritional label. Specifically: &quot;any reference to vitamin content in the advertising of malt beverages would mislead a substantial number of persons to believe that consumption of the product would produce curative or therapeutic effects.&quot; The Bureau ordered him to cease and desist forthwith. </p>
