If it had hit me, I would likely have been seriously injured, but since it missed me, I just started laughing. I then realized that a lot of people seem to react in such a way when they escape from something potentially dangerous and harmful. Why is that? Why do humans respond to threat by laughing? </p></div></div>

<p>—especially the part about how the scientist &quot;believes that laughter developed as an instinctual way to signal that a threat is actually a false alarm.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some theorize that laughter evolved from group calls our early ancestors had. For instance, primates have group calls for snakes, hawks, etc. The theory is that laughter was the signal for &quot;something that at first seems bad, turns out to be okay.&quot; Someone tripping and falling has the potential to be bad. They could have broken a bone. If it turns out they're okay, then laughter usually follows. Naturally laughter feels good. It releases the tension of that possibly bad outcome.</p>
<p>If you analyze the core of most comedy, it can be reduced to &quot;This would be bad, but because of the circumstances, it's okay this time.&quot; Making a silly face at your baby is funny because you make it appear you're disfigured, but you're really not. If you're face <em>is</em> actually like that, it's not funny. Even someone who would laugh at a disfigured person is probably thinking to themselves &quot;That would be bad if it was me, but it's not.&quot;</p>
<p>Your example fits rather nicely into this theory. You almost had a serious injury, but it turns out you're okay. You release that tension with laughter. Everyone who happened to witnessed your accident might have been very concerned until you signaled with your laugh that everything's fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because laughter is an evolved response to indicate “all clear”</p>
<p>There are only 2 expressions that are common throughout human cultures:</p>
<p>Screaming in fear, and laughter.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, laughter is not a response to something being funny, it is the response to the release of tension.</p>
<p>This is how a joke works, it creates tension with the setup, then the punchline releases that tension and causes the laughter response.</p>
<p>This is why being “funny” is such a powerful tool for being considered charismatic. When you see a group of people, and one of them has the rest gathered around, paying attention, and laughing.. this person is perceived as the leader, and they are seen as “safe” because they can make you laugh.</p>
<p>So TL;DR: laughter occurs because you were experiencing tension or unease, and the release of that tension, or the end of the sense of danger, causes the response of laughter to let everyone else around you know that it’s safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
