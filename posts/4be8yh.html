		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone so far has been close, but not quite accurate. There are three main limiting factors with today's technology: cryoprotectant distribution, the rate of freezing in complex tissues, and the interactions of multiple systems/the recovery time from freezing in a complex organism. I apologize for the large wall of text, I'll try to get it as ELI5 and cut down as I can make it! </p>
<p>First off, the concept of freezing an entire human (even a single organ!) is much much much harder than freezing one cell type! When one type of cell (whether it be sperm, epithelial cells, cardiac cells, etc etc) is frozen, we use what is called a cryoprotectant (literally &quot;protects from severe cold&quot;). A cryoprotectant prevents the water within the cells from freezing into dangerous sharp and pokey shapes that can literally shred the cell from the inside out, killing it. Think of putting a bunch of needles inside of a balloon; it wouldn't end well! One such chemical that I use daily for freezing human tissue cultures is dimethyl sulfoxide, aka DMSO. DMSO is added to about a 10% concentration when freezing cells, which is easy to do when it is one cell type freely floating in media. Think of it as a bowl of cereal. If you add chocolate milk to your white milk already in the bowl, the chocolate milk will be able to &quot;interact with&quot; each piece of cereal because it gets diluted into the milk and all of the cereal pieces are equally accessible. This is like cryoprotectants in cell suspensions. Each cell can easily &quot;suck up&quot; the cryoprotectant, making it easy to protect many cells.
In solid tissues and entire organisms, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get an even distribution of cryoprotectant through all tissues, at the same concentration, at the same time. It'd then be incredibly hard to keep it there while we tried to do a controlled-rate freeze of the organism (more on that later). We'd have to put cryoprotectants into many different carrier vehicles (think liposomes and DNA carriers, which are basically little suitcases that only open at their specific destination) in order to get the chemicals to their locations in the correct amounts at the correct times. It's just incredibly challenging.
These cryoprotectants are also cytotoxic (means &quot;toxic to cells&quot;) at anything more than minimal concentrations, so having it in tissues for any longer than necessary will lead to increased cell death. This means you have to quickly freeze the cells as soon as the cryoprotectant is added, and then wash out the cryoprotectant after the cells are thawed. It would be virtually impossible to efficiently remove all of the cryoprotectant from every single different cell type within the body simultaneously. The logistics are just insane! Some cryoprotectants are also incredibly cytotoxic to specific cell types, so those types would die nearly instantly. </p>
<p>The second point is the rate of freezing. When freezing in vitro (test tube) tissue cell lines, you ideally want them to freeze at a controlled rate of 1 degree Celsius per minute down to -80C, then place them in liquid nitrogen (which is at -196C). This controlled and even rate of freezing keeps the cells from exploding and dying. Again, this is easy to accomplish when you have a whole bunch of individual cells floating about in a solution, as they all cool at relatively the same rate. When you try to freeze entire sections of tissue though, it doesn't go as smoothly. The outsides will freeze very very quickly, while the inside of the tissue section will remain warm. Think of putting a thick, juicy steak in the freezer for an hour, then taking it out and cutting it open. The outside will be frozen, but the centre will still be warm and raw. This is the main issue, as the not-yet frozen cells are cut off from all outside supply (oxygen and food!) and waste removal (reactive oxygen species, cellular debris). This makes them stressed and die. The same issue also arises when the tissue is thawed, as the outer parts of the tissue will thaw very quickly (which is good, fast thaw=healthy cells!) while the inside of the tissue will thaw slowly (slow thaw = stressed cells that die). This makes it very hard to get a good, consistent freeze and temperature with complex tissues. The different rates in freezing and thawing also mean that certain parts of complex tissues (which contain many many many different systems, such as blood, lymph, immune system, inflammatory mechanisms, etc etc) will not receive the vital supplies they need! As stated earlier, if one section of the tissue freezes solid, stopping blood flow, but the middle is still not frozen, then the cells in the middle will still try to live, and will then die due to a myriad of factors (lack of oxygen, build-up of toxins, build-up of oxidizing and DNA-damaging compounds, etc). </p>
<p>This same complexity brings us to my third point! This complexity is why freezing an entire organism to be re-animated is extremely challenging. Every single different cell type is going to behave differently to freezing and thawing, and require different procedures to freeze it and thaw it. That's like trying to make 20 different recipes for dinner, all at the same time, with the same ingredients, in the same oven. It is nearly impossible, and needs an incredibly complicated approach! All these different systems will also be thawing at different times and attempting to do their jobs as soon as they're &quot;awake&quot;, but they won't be able to due to the freezing restrictions. Think of your blood cells thawing and waking up, then going &quot;GUYS. WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?!&quot;, due to your cardiac cells still not being quite thawed and viable. This would then cause your red blood cells to get very stressed and die, so then when your lung cells thaw, they'll be like &quot;OH MAN THE BLOOD ISN'T ACCEPTING OXYGEN, WHAT HAPPENED?!&quot;. The tissues everywhere will also be freaking out because their blood is not working correctly. Same goes for the immune system and the lymph system. Without all of the complex, interacting biological processes working ALL AT THE SAME TIME, the organism just simply can't survive. Its honestly amazing how many billions of different things are going on within our bodies at the same time, and they all need to be going at the same time and same rate in order to ensure our survival.
To expand upon the thawing issue, some cells can have a low viability (not many of them survive the freezing and thawing), so there would be tons of dead cells to contend with when the organism is thawed as well. When thawing immortal cancerous cell lines (which are INCREDIBLY hardly little buggers) you can often expect a 50-80% cell survival, with it sometimes being close to 20% or 30% if the freeze affected them bad enough. This means that if a whole human was frozen, and 50% of the cells in these tissues died, then 50% of the entire organism would be useless, dead, and be a detriment to the other living cells. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cryoprotectants keeps cells from dying due to damage from freezing. If you can't get the cryoprotectant to all of the cells at the same time and in the right concentration, they will die. The body is also incredibly complex, making it very very very hard to get all of the systems to freeze at the same time, thaw at the same time, and correctly interact while they are freezing and thawing. Also, lots of cells die during cryopreservation, so there'd be a whole bunch of dead cells that the body would have to try and get rid of. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a lab where we freeze down cells all of the time.  We freeze our cells in a medium that contains 5% DMSO, which among other things can be used as a cryoprotectant.  However, DMSO is also toxic to cells at the concentrations necessary for cryoprotection.  Consequently, when you freeze cells in DMSO, you add the DMSO medium at ice-cold temperatures and don't allow the cells to warm up.  When you later thaw the cells, you have to dilute out the DMSO as quickly as possible without causing osmotic shock, which can pop the cells.  Such restrictions on freezing and thawing would basically be impossible to control at the level of a complete organism.</p>
<p>However, to contradict a lot of previous posts, individual cells can be recovered from freezing with high viability.  When performed properly (and this varies quite a bit by cell type), you can expect &gt;90% of cells to be alive following thaw.</p>
<p>Edit - a more ELI5 explanation that I posted further down</p>
<p>The chemicals that allow cells to survive freezing are toxic to the body. Keeping the cells cold minimized the damage that this chemical does to the cells. With single cell solutions, adding the chemical at ice-cold temperatures and immediately diluting it out when you thaw the cells can keep 90% of the cells alive. There's no way to do this with an intact body.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is probably not the only reason that this technique doesn't scale to organisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have already explained that freezing sperm, while simpler than cryogenically freezing organs or an entire body, requires the use cryoprotectants and the following of a particular protocol.</p>
<p>However, progress continues to be made in cryonics, for example <a href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/prisco20160209" target="_blank">The Small Mammal Brain Preservation Prize Has Been Won</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A team from 21st Century Medicine, spearheaded by recent MIT graduate Robert McIntyre, has discovered a way to preserve the delicate neural circuits of an intact rabbit brain for very long-term storage using a combination of chemical fixation and cryogenic cooling. Proof of this accomplishment, and the full “Aldehyde-Stabilized Cryopreservation” (ASC) protocol, was recently published in the journal Cryobiology and has been independently verified by the BPF through extensive electron microscopic examination conducted by the two official judges of the prize: BPF President Ken Hayworth and Princeton neuroscience professor Sebastian Seung, author of “Connectome: How the Brain’s Wiring Makes Us Who We Are.”</p>
<p>“Every neuron and synapse looks beautifully preserved across the entire brain,” said Hayworth. “Simply amazing given that I held in my hand this very same brain when it was frozen solid… This is not your father’s cryonics.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, you couldn't simply thaw the brain and have it functional again, but in principle the full functionality is preserved and could be recovered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
