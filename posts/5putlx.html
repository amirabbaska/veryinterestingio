<p>The belief stems from an outdated set of circumstances that no longer exist.  Once upon a time, battery casings were made from more porous materials - tarred wood, <a href="http://www.powerstream.com/1922/battery_1922_WITTE/batteryfiles/chapter03.htm" target="_blank">rubber</a>, etc. - which were susceptible to degrading after exposure to the moisture coming from unsealed concrete.  As the casing degraded, battery acid could leak out and water could enter the battery, causing the battery capacity to drop.  </p>
<p>With modern, plastic-encased batteries, the moisture-related degradation isn't really an issue on any meaningful time scales.  </p>
<p>(Incidentally, anecdotal proof is not actually proof.)  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a relevant snippet from the cartalk podcast from NPR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAY: Thirty years ago or so, most battery casings were made of hard rubber. And because of the porosity of that material, battery acid would sometimes seep through
the rubber and create a conductive path through the damp concrete, draining the battery.</p>
<p>TOM: But that can't happen today with plastic-cased batteries. That's because molded polypropylene (a k a plastic), is not porous at all.</p>
<p>RAY: So today, you can put your battery on a concrete floor for as long as you want. And here's the interesting thing, Clay. The cooler the temperature, the slower a
battery's rate of discharge. And because concrete is often cooler than its surroundings, leaving a modern battery on a concrete floor might actually make it last
LONGER.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on an auto parts store. My boss, who was the owner and an engineer,  said to put batteries on a rubber mat on top of wood so we did not damage the floor when we dropped the battery or when it leaked. Batteries are heavy and hard to set on the ground without dropping. That dropping pounder the cement over time and broke it. Plus, acid spills or overfills damages the concrete </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm an electrical worker and install large-scale residential battery systems (think 48V 4000Ah).</p>
<p>Putting a battery directly on the concrete floor can gives you an abnormally low voltage due to the fact that a concrete slab in winter can be exceptionally cold. colder batteries result in slower chemical reactivity in the cells, which then translates as a lower battery output voltage. This means that a battery could be reading as empty when it still holds a substantial charge inside.</p>
<p>This is bad because winter is generally the time that battery systems are used the most due to lower light conditions.</p>
<p>When installing batteries we specifically set them either on wooden slats or plastic boards to thermally insulate them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
