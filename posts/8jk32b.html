	<title>ELI5: I've just found out that some American bars and clubs ban &quot;solid colour t-shirts&quot; in their dress code. I'm English, and this seems beyond absurd to me. Does it really mean you can't wear an ordinary, plain, unbranded t-shirt to their bar? Why on earth not? What kind of crazed ruling is this?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've come across two types of this &quot;dress code&quot;<br />
1st would be in areas of gang activity (or close enough that it would matter). Gangs normally have a color associated with them, banning solid color tees in a place where alcohol is in abundance is a hopeful step in limiting stupid gang related violence due to 'turf' issues.<br />
2nd would be in bars/clubs that are trying to promote more 'upscale' clientele so I've seen dress codes requiring collared shirts on guys or back during the trend (maybe it still exists, not really sure) bans on all 'tall-tees'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went to a middle school near metro Phoenix, AZ. We couldn't wear anything without a design on it. No plain colors whatsoever. We had to wear mesh backpacks or clear backpacks. On our way through the front door we went through a metal detector and had to stop at security and get a stamp that basically meant they searched our bags. Our school had on-site security as well as 3-4 uniformed police officers. </p>
<p>The gang activity in this area was crazy. I've personally watched people shoot at police cars, I had seen multiple drive-b,y shootings. I'd never walk home alone, because gangs didn't care what color your skin was, they recruited all kinds of people. </p>
<p>You might think as a non-american that it's excessive but, what choice are they given? They're just preventing gangs from growing. What's crazy is my wife and I went to a gun range and she'd never been, so Everytime a shot was fired she'd cringe. She asked me after why I didn't even so much as blink when they went off. Growing up around it has made me numb to the sounds of gunfire... </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Door guy here... white tees are the cheapest shirt in the world, usually worn as a undershirt to collect sweat prevents arm pit stains, which translates to &quot;I'm not going to spend money&quot;or &quot;I don't care to look nice&quot; which turns the ladies off. No ladies, no crowd.  No crowd, no money.  The whole idea behind dress code is to only let people in who are going to spend money, due to occupancy fire code regulations, that number is limited.
tl;dr dress codes are to create a crowd that has money or at least looks good=bigger, consistent clientele=more money.  White tees scream no money, no game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
