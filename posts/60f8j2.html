		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was going to look it up and write it in the style of this subreddit, but really the explanation I found was already perfectly ELI5 and I could only make it worse by changing it into my own words, I'm just going to quote it.</p>
<p>There are several theories for this and we don't know which could be the right one. We still haven't understood it completely.</p>
<p>THEORY #1</p>
<p>When you're watching a scary movie, the brain senses a potential threat. So, your adrenal glands release a hormone called adrenaline, which is responsible for the 'flight or fight' response. It prepares the body to confront danger. It increases your energy by several folds. For this, it pumps blood from the periphery (hands, toes) to your vital organs such as heart, kidney, lungs etc so that they pump faster, and work more efficiently. As a result, your face, hands and feet  tend to feel cold'.</p>
<p>When your body temperature decreases, in an attempt to restore the former optimum temperature, the Brain and spinal cord tells your  muscles to tighten and relax one after the other. This causes the sudden electrical shiver down your spine. </p>
<p>THEORY #2 </p>
<p>This is an evolutionary quirk. The reason behind this is the same reason the cat's fur stands up when it is started. The pilomotor reflex. </p>
<p>In an attempt to look BIG and SCARY during threat, the muscles tighten and the hair attached to these muscles stand up (goosebumps) and again this sudden contraction of muscles is experienced as a 'shiver' .  Ancient man apparently used this reflex to scare away wild beasts. And this reflex though has little significance today, remains.</p>
<p>During emotional experiences :</p>
<p>This has happened to all of us. Whenever we've experienced something so unimaginably beautiful or overwhelming- a song, a person, a speech. </p>
<p>Apparently, whenever your brain is triggered by strong emotional stimuli, such as listening to music, it releases a cocktail of hormones, one of which is dopamine. Dopamine is the pleasure hormone. Some suggest that  it's when music sets off some memory of your past/ an overwhelming emotion which you experienced that the brain responds through a sudden alternate muscle contraction and relaxation. It could also be the sudden changes in rhythm of music that trigger such a reaction. </p>
<p>And again, you experience that electrical shudder. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is partly due to the same reason we get goosebumps. The shivers are usually followed by goosebumps, which is in part an evolutionary response. This was more useful when we were covered in body hair, and the hairs stood up when the pores pulled closed. This is to seem &quot;larger&quot; in the same way that cats raise their hairs when threatened. Our response is usually triggered by something scary/emotional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one's really given a good answer. Although I'm no expert I'll give it a go. In that situation you described it's probably the feeling of an adrenaline rush going through your body since you imagined yourself in a life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>In response to this, your brain thinks you're in danger and so tells the sympathetic nervous system to kick into gear, causing adrenaline secretion among a whole bunch of other effects mediated by the sympathetic system. This is designed to keep you alive and survive whatever immediate threat is endangering you, however in your case it's all imagined. </p>
<p>Happy to be disproved though. I think shivers down spines is a bit of a contentious issue with regards to them during music, but I'm fairly confident since they are happening when you imagine danger it's due to the sympathetic system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
