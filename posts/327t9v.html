<p>So what is it we're fighting against thats trying to keep us asleep?</p>
<p>Is it the same thing that makes us feel groggy until we wake up fully?</p>
<p>What makes it harder to do when you're more tired?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about is referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_inertia" target="_blank">&quot;sleep inertia&quot;</a>. The grogginess and desire to return to sleep can last as long as 30 minutes, depending on several factors- including which stage of sleep you wake up from (waking up during deep sleep is associated with the most sleep inertia.)</p>
<p>Also caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the effects of adenosine, and has been shown to greatly reduce sleep inertia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mainly has to do with the regulation of circadian clocks. Apart from adenosine (which accumulates during the day), melatonin is the primary hormone that signals the body to go to sleep. It accumulates when no longer exposed to light, which literally keeps you asleep during the night.</p>
<p>Wakefulness is maintained by exposing your eyes to blue light (present in sunlight and even more so in your computer screen) which is detected by a pigment called melanopsin in 2% of retinal cells (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells). These cells signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which in turn is the master regulator of the body's &quot;clock&quot;. Thus, at night your body is signalled to become asleep by various mechanisms (adenosine, melatonin, blue light absence) as well as others which are largely dependent on oscillatory &quot;clock genes&quot;; hormones such as vasopressin and cortisol are strongly controlled by the clock. To wake up, the levels of all these hormones need to be brought back to their &quot;awake&quot; levels and it takes time for this to happen after your brain is signalled to do so (blue light received and/or end of the cycle).</p>
<p>Some basics: <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Circadian.html" target="_blank">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Circadian.html</a></p>

<p>TL;DR: blue light keeps your body awake and sets the timer on your inner clock. Yep, you're fighting a clock.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep operates on a 'flip flop switch' mechanism, where circuits that promote sleep inhibit those that promote wakefulness, and vice versa.</p>
<p>In a 2 process model of sleep, sleep inertia can be attributed to neurotransmitters promoting sleep remaining elevated during wakefulness, or your circadian system may be primed to promote sleep and according to your body's clock, you're awake at the wrong time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of adrenaline = heavy sleepness.</p>
<p>No adenosine = less urge to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Adrenaline agonism (or reuptake inhibiting) = wide awake feeling even if you're tired. </p>
<p>Anything resembling PEA (phenylethylamine) does this. Including Curcumin and amphetamines. </p>
<p>Increasing dopamine efflux also has an indirect effect on reducing the quality of sleep and may make some people insomniac.</p>
<p>This explains why even on downers you feel you dont quite get decent sleep if they happen to increase dopamine levels. The only exception being GHB due to its dopamine inhibiting effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
