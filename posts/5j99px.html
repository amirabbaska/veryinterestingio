A solid, opaque object like a wall has microstructures that are of a similar size to the wavelength of light (i.e. very, very small - nanometre to micrometre scale) so it interacts strongly with visible light and therefore blocks it. But the wavelength of a radiowave is much greater, often measured in metres, so it doesn't interact anywhere near as much with materials that would block visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radio waves <em>are</em> a form of light, just a longer wavelength (lower frequency) than visible light.  Xrays and gamma rays are very short wavelength, higher frequency light well above the visible range.</p>
<p>Photons are the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force.  That means whenever particles interact with electrical fields or magnetic fields (which are the same thing, kind of...that's a different ELI5), photons are exchanged.</p>
<p>When a photon encounters an atom, it may get absorbed by an electron &quot;orbiting&quot; the atomic nucleus.  If it does get absorbed, the electron will move into a higher &quot;orbit&quot; which is called an &quot;excited state&quot; (when the electron is as low as it can be, it's in the &quot;ground state&quot;).  Later, the electron will fall back into the ground state and emit a photon.</p>
<p>Photons will only be absorbed if they have exactly enough energy to move an electron up to an empty higher orbital.  There are no &quot;half-orbitals&quot; - the electron goes all the way up to the next &quot;slot&quot;, or it doesn't go anywhere.  The more energetic the photon (ie: the higher the frequency), the higher the orbital the electron will move up to.  But if the photon does not have enough energy to move an electron into an empty orbital, it will not be absorbed at all.</p>
<p>Photons in the visible spectrum are absorbed easily by most atoms.  The vast majority of molecules have electrons arranged such that photons in the visible spectrum will have the right amount of energy to move an electron into a new orbital, which means the photon is absorbed.  Photons <em>below</em> the visible spectrum, however, do not have a lot of energy - not enough to move most electrons unless they're in a very low orbital with an empty one right above it.  Sometimes there's not enough energy even for that.  Here you have to remember that light is both a particle <em>and</em> a wave: instead of each individual photon acting on each individual electron, the <em>wave</em> function of the light pushes on <em>all</em> the electrons it encounters a little bit.</p>
<p>That pushing is how radio waves transmit information.  When the electrons are all pushed in the same direction, that's literally the definition of an electrical current.  It's a very weak current, but you can amplify it and that's how the signal is communicated.  Microwave ovens do something similar, except that it's tuned to push the electrons around in water.  Since water doesn't have the kind of free-floating electrons that metal crystals have, the electrons just kind of wiggle around, which forces the whole atom to wiggle around, which creates heat.</p>
<p>So radio waves pass through walls because the molecules in the wall can't absorb them.  The electrons aren't in the right orbitals and a single photon of that wavelength can't be used by the electron, so it's ignored.  The whole wave does push on the electrons a <em>little</em> bit, but no significant amount of signal is lost by one wall.  Since metal conducts electricity very well, the radio waves will be absorbed better, so metal blocks radio waves much better.  And of course, enough of <em>any</em> material will still absorb the radio waves completely.  Visible light is just in the sweet spot where it <em>can</em> be absorbed by most molecules.</p>
<p>For the record, photons above the visible spectrum are so energetic that when electrons absorb them, they don't just go into a higher orbital, they fly off the atom completely.  Those photons, like Xrays and gamma rays, are so energetic that they can't interact with matter very well, like radio waves, but on the opposite end of the spectrum - they're <em>too</em> energetic.  And, unlike radio waves, when they do interact with matter it's very destructive, which is why it's dangerous to living things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be super oversimplified, but when light interacts with matter, it can do one of three things</p>
<p>A. Nothing</p>
<p>B. Get absorbed</p>
<p>C. Get reflected.</p>
<p>Radio waves happen to be at a wavelength where A happens a lot more readily than B or C with respect to walls, so it simply passes through with no interaction.</p>
<p>Edit: energy level to wavelength for clarity</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What we call &quot;light&quot; is actually &quot;visible light&quot; however there is much more light that we can't see.  Rainbows actually have far more colours (they are wider than we think) but we humans can't see them because our eyes aren't good enough.  These colours we can't see include radio waves, x-rays, UV rays, lots of rays!</p>
<p>Now, when we shine visible light through water, it comes out the other side because water is transparent to visible light. In the same way, walls are transparent to radio waves and muscles are transparent to x-rays (but bones are not).  Radio waves don't go through everything though... just like walls absorb visible light, x-rays are absorbed by bones, radio waves are absorbed by concrete and even water.</p>
<p>Fun bit of information... Since water absorbs radio waves, we can use these waves to heat up water just like shining a really bright light will heat up a wall.  This is exactly what your microwave oven is doing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
