		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semen is in fact recognized as foreign not only to the female but to the male immune system. Yes, your own body would attack and destroy your own sperm cells if it were not rigorously kept out of harms way by other specialized cells in the testes. As to why sperm is 'safe' in the vagina, it isn't. Technically outside the body, the vaginal vault would not immediately recognize foreign proteins present in the ejaculate fluid, but there is an immune presence. Seminal fluid which makes up most of the volume of the ejaculate helps buffer the pH of the vagina to be more suitable for the spermatozoa. Also, the fluid helps insulate the sperm (to a degree) from the female immune system. Finally, the sperm don't wait around to be found, but rather work their way toward the ovum with the intent of fertilizing it. Sperm can live in these conditions for days.  Following fertilization, the placenta is formed which provides a sort of 'biological airlock' between the mother and embryo to help prevent the mother's immune system from recognizing and destroying the developing fetus. There is a complication in some pregnancies where a previously sensitized Rh negative mother has an Rh positive baby, but that is a specialized case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should check out Inside the Human Body (BBC). There's an episode that illustrates the sperms journey to the egg. White blood cells do attack the sperm until they reach the Fallopian Tube.</p>
<p>The show said that from an original 250+ million sperm ejaculated in into a woman, as few as 20 make it to the Fallopian Tube. It's an effective selection process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The acidic vaginal environment is actually pretty inhospitable to sperm. There are immune cells that attack it, but sperm has a few tricks up its sleeve. </p>
<p>1) Before ejculation, men release &quot;pre-cum&quot; or pre ejaculatory fluid. This contains a bicarbonate compound to buffer the vaginal pH.</p>
<p>2) When a man ejaculates, there's lots of sperm. It's like firing a shotgun. This can overwhelm the vaginal environment and immune system.</p>
<p>3) Sperm is outfitted with something called a flagella, this makes it very, very fast. They can usually outmanuver the immune cells.</p>
<p>With these three things, they can get past the host defenses and get to the egg. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers here, but also, it is a natural selection issue.  Only humans that don't kill all foreign sperm can reproduce / pass on their genes.  Characteristics that allow for the passage of an optimal amount of sperm are adaptive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
