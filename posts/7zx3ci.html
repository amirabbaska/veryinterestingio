		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With our current knowledge, there is a theoretical limit, called the Planck temperature.
A body emit light with a wavelength corresponding to its temperature, and a body at the Planck temperature emit light with a wavelength of the Planck length.</p>
<p>The Planck length is kind of our distance limit of the comprehension of the universe without a quantum gravity theory.</p>
<p>If you want, at the Planck temperature, the energy involved are so high, we don't yet have a model that works to describe the behavior of matter.</p>
<p>EDIT: as /u/JoJosh-The-Barbarian mentioned, the Planck temperature is not a limit as the higher temperature possible, but as the limit of our understanding</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two good answers to this.</p>
<p>The first is the “Planck temperature”, which is about 1.42×10^32 kelvins. In a system with that temperature, particles have so much energy that gravitational forces overwhelm the other forces like electromagnetism. We use quantum theory to model the behavior of particles, but we know that quantum theory does not properly account for gravity, so we know that it doesn't say anything sensible about what would happen at that temperature. A “quantum theory of gravity”, which is a sort of holy grail for physicists, might work to describe such a system.</p>
<p>The second answer is in some sense the true counterpart to absolute zero. To explain it, I need to briefly talk about <em>negative temperature</em>. In thermodynamics, temperature is defined as the reciprocal of a quantity called <em>thermodynamic beta</em>. A high beta means that adding energy to a system will increase the entropy by a lot, while a low beta means that adding energy will only increase entropy a little. Cold systems have a large beta, and hot systems have a small beta. Absolute zero temperature corresponds to infinite beta — intuitively, this is one way of understanding why absolute zero can never be reached, because it's really an infinity in disguise.</p>
<p>What if beta is negative? That would mean that adding energy to a system would <em>decrease</em> its entropy. This is forbidden by classical thermodynamics, but it's possible in special cases in quantum theory. For example, it can happen in systems where most particles have as much energy as they possibly can, so adding energy to the system would mean bumping up some other particles from their own diverse states to the common maximum. If a system has negative beta, then it also has negative temperature (because temperature is just the reciprocal of beta). But high beta is cold, and low beta is hot, so negative temperatures are hotter than positive temperatures!</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c5be56e1b5d297b9995615a47707f52b" target="_blank">this graph</a>. (The graph has the right shape, but the labels aren't relevant to us.) We can take the X axis to represent temperature and the Y axis to represent beta. We can see that a positive temperature means a positive beta, a negative temperature means a negative beta, a large (far from zero) temperature means a small (close to zero) beta, and a small temperature means a large beta. We can see that as temperature approaches positive or negative infinity, beta approaches zero, and as temperature approaches zero, beta approaches positive infinity from one direction and negative infinity from the other.</p>
<p>The absolute zero we know — absolute cold — means infinite positive beta. When we only look at the right side of the graph (positive temperature), it makes sense to handwave that this means zero temperature. Informally, we're dividing by infinity and getting zero. This is not really valid math, but it's a reasonable way to think about it.</p>
<p>Absolute hot, on the other hand, would mean infinite <em>negative</em> beta. When we translate that to temperature, we'd be dividing by negative infinity and getting… also zero. (Again, this is not real math. Infinity and negative infinity are not real numbers and you can't divide by them.) So if we really want to talk about temperature instead of beta, then both absolute cold and absolute hot can be found at zero kelvin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know.</p>
<p>The wavelength of light emitted by an object is directly calculable from its temperature. As temperature increases (however momentarily), wavelength decreases.</p>
<p>Plank theory suggests that the universe is quantised, meaning that there's a constant step between points in space, energy levels, etc...</p>
<p>The Plank constant theorises that there's a minimum interval between any two energy levels of ~4.1 x 10^-15 electron volts.</p>
<p>The plank length theorises that there's a minimum interval between any two points in space of ~1.6 x 10^-35 meters.</p>
<p>Were the temperature of a particle to exceed ~1.4 x 10^32 degrees Kelvin, the wavelength of the emitted light would fall below the plank length. We have no idea what happens next, much less how the laws of physics behave at such extremes.</p>
<p>The Plank length is so small and the Plank temperature so high that we've had a very hard time conducting meaningful scientific inquiry into them or assessing their meaningfulness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
