		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of note, the temperature difference you're talking about is an <em>average</em> for the <em>WORLD</em>. Local temperatures may vary wildly from this, which is part of the problem, as waters around corals heat up drastically on some days. It's not the 1-2C that's the problem, it's that couple of days at +10C (or more!) above normal temps that really cause the problems we're looking at. The &quot;higher on average&quot; is a way to show not just that it can/will have those unusual (and often unexpected, which can kill) temperature spikes, but also that there's some <em>underlying</em> issue raising temperatures steadily, as opposed to <em>just</em> spikes and things remaining relatively constant otherwise (denialists must find <em>something</em> that is also contributing to this process if they want to discount human-released carbon). Most people haven't spent much time digging into what &quot;global warming&quot; even means, but the above is just a taste - <strong>if temperatures are higher on average, that means there have been some much higher than normal spikes of high temps and a lack of low temps, which can kill anything. The speed of the change is a big factor, happening in decades rather than millenia or longer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://data.aims.gov.au/aimsrtds/yearlytrends.xhtml" target="_blank">http://data.aims.gov.au/aimsrtds/yearlytrends.xhtml</a></p>
<p>(e; point being, coral can tolerate higher temp differences than 1C, just not spikes, especially not prolonged - and simply put, much of it <em>has</em> died in the past, but you often don't see such fast changes in temperature. It's not a guarantee, but it's possible that the coral would have enough genetic variation that something which can survive those higher temps has been generated, such that as the temps change, that variation survives and propagates while the rest of it dies - but often, it will all just die. The problem now is that it's happening so fast that the likelihood of variations which can handle higher temps actually occurring is low in the time frame they have given the speed of warming. Pretty sure there have been several similar die-offs, but if the warming <em>is</em> human made, and we don't change what's causing it, there's no expectation coral will survive at all.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biology masters student here</p>
<p>Explanation as if you were actually 5:
Corals have roommates (zooxanthellae) who live inside them and do almost all the cooking. They have a lot of cooking equipment that is sensitive to temperature. When it gets too hot and the zooxanthellae don't cook well, the coral get rid of them and hope a new roommate will come along who can take the heat. This used to be a great way to deal with temperature change, but unfortunately it's gotten so hot recently that there are no more roommates nearby who can cook for the coral, and they die. </p>
<p>More in depth explanation:
So most reef building corals have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, a photosynthetic organism. The corals keep the zooxanthellae safer than they would be in the ocean, and are able to provide them with some of the nutrients they need. In turn, zooxanthellae create most of the energy needed for the production of the reef. There are slow growing corals that live without zooxanthellae, but they grow even slower than reef coral. </p>
<p>Zooxanthellae species are adapted to very specific temperatures (this is true of many single celled photosynthetic organisms in the ocean). They also live free floating in the ocean as plankton. </p>
<p>So the hypothesis is that corals expel the zooxanthellae when they are stressed out, and new zooxanthellae will colonize the coral that function better in whatever the new water conditions are. This made coral great at dealing with change in the past, because there was usually a different zooxanthellae that could help them out. But now, this strategy is maladaptive, because there are no better zooxanthellae nearby. So what has helped keep coral alive for so long is actually no longer useful when temperatures get this high. </p>
<p>As others have pointed out, pollution and ocean acidification also contribute to coral reef decline. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In one extreme case, it didn't. Back before the Permian we have rugose and tabulate. During the mass extinctions at the time they were wiped out and for millions of years the Earth just didn't have any corals. Then, sometime in the Triassic, a new type of coral called scleractinia evolved from a common ancestor with modern day anemones. These are the guys we still see around today. From what we think we know, the ancient coral varieties had similar relationships with algae as the modern day ones and it's possible that the climatic chaos of the Permian killed off that algae, leading to the loss of the coral.</p>
<p>While the Permian climate was much more volitile than that of today, the addition of man made chemicals into the ecosystem certainly isn't helping corals survive. The algae are generally thought to be the more fragile member of the coral partnership, so anything that detriments them can destroy the whole.</p>
<p>I realize now I forgot to answer your question. Just let that illustrate that corals don't always survive I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It can't adapt to rapid changes because that isn't how evolution typically works.</p>
