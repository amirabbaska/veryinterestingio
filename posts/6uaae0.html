		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's three main stages to burnt food; firstly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" target="_blank">Maillard reaction.</a> Where sugars react with amino acids to produce a set of chemicals that give the distinctive browning to foods like bread crusts and toasted marshmallows. </p>
<p>At higher temperatures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization" target="_blank">caramelization</a> takes over. Basically  the sugars break down and release a range of chemicals and especially butanedione which gives that 'caramel'/'butter' smell common with popcorn.</p>
<p>The 'burnt' part comes from [pyrolysis] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis</a>) which is a form of thermal decomposition with little to no oxygen on organic molecules, carbohydrates and proteins in this case. The products of burnt food are essentially charcoal, which is the blackened toast flavour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Popcorn and bread are in fact made from very similar things: corn and wheat. Both are grains and both consist mainly of starch, which is a polysaccharide (lots of sugar stuck together.) Bread has been fermented a bit so it tastes different, and of course wheat and corn taste a bit different to begin with, but the basic components are the same. Flavour chemicals tend to be light molecules because they have to be either volatile so you can smell them or water soluble so you can taste them on the tongue. This means that when you heat food you can drive off a lot of those flavours leaving you with food that tastes similar to other food that tastes too hot.</p>
<p>The other thing is that when you burn food, you're chemically changing the food. That means it will taste different, because taste is just detecting certain chemicals. More than that, all chemicals in food are pretty similar in some ways - they tend to be organic molecules consisting primarily of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with quite a bit of nitrogen and a few other bits and pieces. If you apply enough energy to molecules, they tend to break apart and recombine, but how they recombine doesn't necessarily always correspond exactly to what they were before. If you completely burn fatty acids or burn starch, you get still get carbon dioxide and water. When you burn food you don't burn it completely, but something similar is going on: different chemicals break down and you end up with something that will resemble more closely the product of burning something quite different. Hence they taste similar.</p>
<p>So when you burn bread, or popcorn or even something a less similar, you're going to end up basically with something resembling a kind of charcoal: a mixture of different carbon compounds that doesn't have the unique flavour molecules that the food started with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;browning&quot; of foods (like when you sear a steak and get that nice crust) is due to the Maillard reaction, which is a chemical reaction at high temperatures between amino acids (protein) and sugars (carbohydrates) that produce a wide variety of byproducts that are pleasing to our palates. </p>
<p>In contrast, when you continue to heat food beyond the Maillard reaction, you get pyrolytic reactions. At first this involves the caramelization of sugars, which also produces pleasing flavors. But eventually the sugars break down even further into compounds that we find bitter and unpleasant.</p>
<p>All of these byproducts from these reactions may be different depending on the food that is being heated, but they all share a similar flavor profile. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat reactions in food.</p>
<p>At lower temperatures you have the Maillard reaction which is an enzymatic reaction. Each food is going to have a unique taste because of the specific amino acids that are being broken down.</p>
<p>At a slightly higher temperature you get caramelization which is the breakdown of sugars into a handful of chemicals.</p>
<p>More than this you get pyrolysis which is burning. The chemicals breakdown to a variety of gases, chemicals, and carbon solids.</p>
<p>In extreme pyrolysis, you wind up with mostly carbon solids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Heat causes sugars react with amino acids to form new complex (and flavoursome!) molecules.</p>
<p>Chips, crusty rolls and cooked meats all owe some of their flavour to this reaction. I'm guessing this is what you are tasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
