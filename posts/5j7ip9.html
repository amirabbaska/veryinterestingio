Check out MinuteEarth's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owNMCTmbG9w" target="_blank">new video on the topic</a> to learn more!</p>
<p>We're joined in this thread by David (/u/goldenbergdavid) from MinuteEarth, as well as Alex Reich (/u/reichale). Alex has an MS in Natural Resources Science &amp; Management from the University of Minnesota, and has spent time with reindeer herders in Scandinavia and Russia, with caribou hunters in Greenland and Canada, and with many a Rangifer-related paper on his computer.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reindeer meat industry never took off in the United States, but it's fascinating to see that another meat has almost caught up to beef in the last 100 years. People used to only eat only 10 pounds of chicken a year - now they eat almost 60. <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2010/12/09/beef-or-chicken-a-look-at-u-s-meat-trends-in-the-last-century/" target="_blank">http://freakonomics.com/2010/12/09/beef-or-chicken-a-look-at-u-s-meat-trends-in-the-last-century/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Fairbanks, Alaska. Reindeer meat is quite common here. We also have a Reindeer Farm on campus here at UAF. They're quite docile with humans!</p>
<p>I've had reindeer sausage many times. Reindeer steaks once or twice. Reindeer jerkey. I made Hamburger Helper with Reindeer Sausage once. Incredible.</p>
<p>Try it if you get the chance to. If anyone wants to try it, I can ship some to you! Just pay for the product and the shipping and I'll be glad to help. Just PM me if interested.</p>
<p>EDIT: I had a lot of people ask me about shipping them reindeer steaks and fillets and stuff. I can't and <strong>WON'T do that</strong> for safety reasons. It will spoil before it gets to you. I can only ship cured meats (sausages, jerky, etc) because it can sit out and not spoil. If you want to get some legit fresh meat from up here, please contact <a href="http://www.deltameat.com/delta.pdf" target="_blank">Delta Meats</a> and place an order with them directly. They can ship next-business day in chilled freight, from what I understand. Expect that to be VERY pricey though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in northern Sweden and here we got raindeer meat in every supermarket, hamburger and pizza restaurant. </p>
<p>The native people in Scandinavia, the sami people have lived off herding raindeers for thousands of years.
Nowdays they a sort of have a monopoly on the herding since its kinda the only thing they got left since the swedes took control over the area.</p>
<p>The Swedish word for raindeer is 'ren', I suspect that's the orgin of the English word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
