		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We killed all the dangerous mega-fauna.</p>
<p>There used to be wolves and bears and even lions around to prey on people. There also used to be wild aurochs roaming around and all sorts of smaller critters.</p>
<p>Humans ended up killing them all.</p>
<p>The combination of being densely settled and having much of the wilderness destroyed to make room for agriculture means that there is not much room for wild animals that don't get along with humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the explanation is that there have been hunted to extinction. There where Lions in Greece and the Balkans until 100AD, they where hunted and captured for gladiatorial games etc. Europe have had a large population for a long time so the floran and fauna are shaped by humans.</p>
<p>There are few wolf and bears in Europe because in most places they are hunted to extinction.</p>
<p>So if you compare with North America and Asia at the same latitude you will find some large cats that don't live Europe. But those areas are less populated  and the population drops when large numbers of humans live there from habitat destruction and hunting.</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken there are no large population of other animals dangerous for humans that live in the same climate. Venomous snakes, scorpion etc lives in warmer climate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Europe is the original home^^1 of the following large animals that will kill you, in order of likelihood if you mess with them:</p>
<p>Woolly Mammoth</p>
<p>Aurochs (wild cattle)</p>
<p>Neanderthal man</p>
<p>Wooly Rhino</p>
<p><del>Short-faced bear</del> Cave bear (basically a massive grizzly)</p>
<p>Brown bear (grizzly)</p>
<p>Straight-tusked elephant</p>
<p>Wisent (European bison)</p>
<p>Saber-toothed cat</p>
<p>Cave lion</p>
<p>Cave hyena</p>
<p>Horse</p>
<p>Timber wolf</p>
<p>Wild boar</p>
<p>Moose (elch)</p>
<p>Giant deer</p>
<p>Elk (Red stag)</p>
<p>Of those, only a handful of mostly game species remain, like red stag, moose and wild boar.  Timber wolves have mostly been extirpated except in European Russia and maybe the Pyrenees.  All of the truly dangerous game was either wiped out (mammoths, their predators like cave lions and cave bears) or, actually, domesticated.  The aurochs in particular was famously dangerous in Roman periods; its last wild descendant was killed in Poland if I remember right in the 18th century. You can see its domestic descendants in any cattleyard.  Likewise horses and Neanderthal man were domesticated, with the least placid individuals wiped out. In the case of Neanderthal man we inbred with some and killed the rest.</p>
<p>Europe is basically a garden.  It has been as heavily modified by man at the height of his abilities as anywhere in the world, AND its climate has changed radically since we got there, which put additional pressure on the local megafuna in a way inconsistent with, say, India or Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Fair point about brown bears (grizz).  For whatever reason, European brown bears don't have the fearsome reputation of North American grizzlies, but I still do not advise you to poke one with a stick if you see one in Russia, the Balkans, or Finland.</p>
<p>^^1 i.e. Europe was home to these animals when modern man (Homo sapiens sapiens) arrived.  Many evolved elsewhere and migrated to Europe over the years before Man arrived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the big predators that lived in Europe went extinct either naturally or were hunted to (almost) extinction, and the climate isn't fit for most other apex predators (even though there were Crocs in the Medittereanian Sea until ~2000 BC or something and Lions up to the first century after Christ.) EDIT: I've been browsing around abit about Crocodiles and Europe and it turns out there are a few historical mentions of them appearing on Europes south coasts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were all kinds of cool things in Europe a few thousand years ago, mammoths, rhinos, lions, etc. But like others have said all the large “exotic” fauna have been hunted to oblivion!</p>
<p>Edit: not just extinct from hunting, climate change was a large factor for many European species adapted to the cold climates. (Wooly rhinos, mammoths, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
