<p>I've noticed significant image tracking/persistence in the room since the change - for example, when I wave my hand in front of my face I can see extra instances of my hand along the trail of movement.</p>
<p>A similar effect is created when I wave my hand in front of a computer or TV screen.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to happen under the halogen light or in daylight.</p>
<p>What causes this effect and why does the type of light make a difference?</p></div></div>

<p>The still images you see are like what you see on the dance floor in clubs, the subject is iluminated for a very short time, creating a still image like a camera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only low quality LEDs do this, it's because they are not on all the time but they are pulsing, and to maintain the same average light appearance as a normal lamp, they have to peak much higher.</p>
<p>So when you move your hand under this light you only see frames of the movement when the light is the brightest, basically like on TV. I find this incredibly annoying to work in such light, in the kitchen it can probably even be dangerous if you don't see as well as you should while cutting vegetables!</p>
<p>It's difficult to know which LEDs are bad in this sense because the bad ones aren't exactly keen on advertising they are using a cheap and bad technique. But keep the brand in mind so you know what to avoid next time you're buying LEDs ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is what you get for buying cheap AC-powered LEDs. Incandescents produce light from heat. They take a while to warm up, a while to cool down. Alternating current turns on, off, flips around back on and so on dozens of times a second. Incandescents do not have enough time to cool down, so they emit almost constant brightness. LEDs however emit light proportional to the current going through them right at that instant, so any time the AC drops to zero, the LED goes dark. You do not notice it when you are just looking into a static room, but a moving object will now leave a trail of copies instead of a blur trail. Higher-quality LED bulbs will come with a rectifier which turns the AC into DC first to reduce this effect, with varying results. Since G9 bulbs are quite small, high-quality rectifiers are difficult (and expensive).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have migraine so sometimes ill get visual aura as an image trail after any movement, like a matrix slow mo effect and i noticed that every evening my vision gets... weird a little bit.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I noticed this with my ceiling fan when I put LEDs in my nightstand lamps. I could kind of see the individual blades as it spun full-speed, where it was just a round blur with the incandescents. I thought it might be a wavelength thing, because I am not a rocket surgeon.
