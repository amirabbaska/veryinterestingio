		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I should begin with the disclaimer that I'm not an expert in the subject. That being said, I do have a very strong interest in geopolitics and can hopefully provide a half-decent answer until someone better educated comes along. Of the top of my head, I can think of three potential reasons for why Oman is relatively stable compared to other Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>First, most Muslim states (in the Middle East and elsewhere) are either predominately Shia or Sunni. Oman is the one exception to this, as it is primarily Ibadi. As such, it has largely stayed out of Shia-Sunni conflicts.</p>
<p>Second, it has a relatively diverse economy, which means that it is more stable than if it was solely based on oil. You can also see this is the UAE (particularly in Dubai) and other areas of MENA with a diversified economy.</p>
<p>Third, I think that your original premise is based on a flawed assumption. You said that it's in the middle of chaos, but it isn't. Oman borders 3 other states: KSA, Yemen, and the UAE. Of these, Yemen is the only one that is currently undergoing significant strife. Compared to other parts of the Arab world (Somalia, Palestine, Iraq), the Gulf States (with the exception of Iraq) are relatively stable and prosperous.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also not an Oman expert, but I have a reasonable grasp of Middle Eastern geopolitics. </p>
<p>/u/entropydecreaser has made some good points: Oman's economy is relatively stable and its geographic position is advantageous- away from major lines of conflict in the region. It is a long way from one end of the Arabian Peninsula to the other, and Oman have no reason to get themselves too closely involved with what is happening over a thousand miles northwest. Oman is also tucked away behind the 'empty quarter', the largest sand desert in the world, which makes external interference, particularly military action, extremely difficult. </p>
<p>I would say that the major factor, though (in my opinion) is the fact that Oman has existed as an entity for centuries. Almost no ME states preexist the 20th century and even those which can claim to, such as Egypt or arguably Iran, have been shaped by colonialism and revolution over the past hundred years or so. It is in stark contrast, therefore, that Oman have not only been free of colonial domination for over 250 years, but at one point had a sizeable empire of their own.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Oman has been entirely free of conflict or upheaval (it has not), but it is a far more 'natural' state than those created by colonial powers in the Levant, and they have a degree of institutional continuity through the monarchy that is unmatched in the Middle East. This is in stark contrast to those states created by treaty in the early 20th century, which have been highly unstable since, and because of, their drawing on the map. </p>
<p>Obviously I may be corrected my someone with more expertise, but that would be my take on the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Figured I'd read up on Oman after I saw your post cause yea realized I knew nothing about it really. Seems like a pretty stable place with a steady stream of social reforms within a traditional monarchy. Wikipedia mentioned they've worked to diversify their exports away from just oil. I'm sure there's a lot more to it than that and there's probably some good and bad there like anywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
