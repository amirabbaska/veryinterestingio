		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin: </p>
<p>Your skin is fairly smooth, and is waterproof. When you draw on your arm in marker, the ink is carried from the tip to your skin by a solvent, like propyl alcohol, this solvent quickly dries. The solvent isn't water, so it penetrates more deeply into the keratinized layer of skin. This leaves the ink on the top of your skin, and a little will get INSIDE your skin (I'm talking in microns) this is why when you wash it off, most of it, the stuff on the surface, comes off fairly easily. It isn't water soluble, so you have to scrub and use soap, but it comes off. Then you always have a little left, the stuff INSIDE the very outside layer. Which you have to scrub hard to get off, you're mostly just scrubbing off that layer. </p>
<p>For blood, it can't get inside your skin, so it just dries on the surface. It's also water soluble, so it's easier to get off. The color is also from red blood cells, they're much larger than ink molecules, but the blood just stays in the cracks of your skin that are harder to clean. </p>
<p>Fabric: </p>
<p>Think of a rope, the brown kind you see on ships in movies. </p>
<p>Thread isn't that much different, just smaller.</p>
<p>Ink will stain the fabric just easily as blood. The solvent spreads the ink into the fabric through capillary action and that's why when you draw on a white shirt with marker, you get the bleed where you aren't marking, the ink is traveling down the thread. </p>
<p>Blood interacts with the threads in a similar way. Cotton will absorb water, so blood will absorb onto the thread just like ink. It will go into all the little nooks and crannies of the thread, and while red blood cells are bigger than the ink, they're small enough to get to the very inside of the thread. </p>
<p>Then you try to wash the blood out, the red blood cells are inside that thread, they're trapped now, they flow in, but can't flow out. When you wash it, the red blood cells pop, leaving the red color behind, which is still trapped, stuck to individual cotton fibers now. </p>
<p>That's why you can wash out <em>some</em> of the blood, it's the blood on the surface of the thread, but you can't wash the blood that's on the inside of the thread. </p>
<p>Edit: I avoided talking about prune fingers because it's contentious and irrelevant to this ELI5. </p>
<p>Prune fingers are better at grabbing while underwater, but is it due to the absorption of a small amount of water on the exterior surface of your skin? Or is it due to the body increasing the porosity of the capillaries at the skin on your fingers that causes the swelling? It's currently being investigated and I have yet to see conclusive results from either side. </p>
<p>However, it's irrelevant for this conversation. If you put your hand in a bowl of water, how long does it take to get prune fingers? How often are you floating your hand in blood? </p>
<p>If I put a droplet of blood on your arm, it will bead up and you can just brush it off. Or, you can take a cloth, and the cloth will absorb the blood. </p>
<p>So for this conversation, skin is waterproof. </p>
<p>Edit 2: a couple people have mentioned that those with nerve damage don't get prune fingers, which supports skin being waterproof and that prune fingers are from a biological response. I haven't heard of this before, so I won't comment on it beyond saying that it's compelling proof. </p>
<p>That prune fingers is due to absorption of water by the skin was probably not something a scientist tested. It is a completely logical and sound thing for someone to assume, and even if skin is waterproof, that you <em>eventually</em> absorb <em>some</em> water is still reasonable. </p>
<p>These kinds of facts are very common, no one thinks to test them, there really isn't any reason to, until there is. That prune fingers is due to a biological response could be a very important fact for science, it can help teach us about localized responses, how local conditions are sensed, how the brain analyzes the information, and many other things. </p>
<p>This is why I question everything, if it hasn't been tested, then it is only a hypothesis, not a fact. Also, not to trust anyone, always read the literature XDl</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the blood, it's about the material the blood is getting on. Clothes are very prone to stain in general due to the fabrics involved. The fabric will absorb the blood the same way it absorbs water, soda, wine, etc. You skin isn't absorbent like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>materials like fabric have many pores and crevices that the blood can get into. </p>
<p>when the blood coagulates, it undergoes a chemical change that hardens it in place. once tangled with many fibers and ...'cured', it's nearly impossible to get out. this is because, kinda like glue, your blood is designed to 'freeze' in place to physically block cuts in your skin when it is damaged.</p>
<p>Now consider your skin, it is a wall to protect you from the outside down to the cellular level. It even has some complex self-cleaning mechanisms in the pores. </p>
<p>Outside of hair and pores, blood doesnt really have much to grab onto. but, alas, your skin isnt perfect. once blood is dried on, it'll find any little cracks and folds and stick in them, requiring some scrubbing. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood comes off of clothes if washed with cold water. Hot water actually makes the blood stains permanent. </p>
<p>It's a matter of what is being used to remove the stain. To remove a permanent marker stain, alcohol, being a favorable solvent, is a good alternative. Same way (cold) water for blood. </p>
<p>What happens with hot water is that the biomolecules inside blood do get dissociated into simpler components which are not very affine(soluble) with water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
