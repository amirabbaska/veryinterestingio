		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically, yes, but 'eventually' might be a pretty long time, like 100s of millions of years. If we look at Earth, one of the perplexing problems that folks like myself who are interested in how rivers shape landscapes is the persistence of topography in tectonically dead areas. There are numerous examples, but let's take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains#Geography_and_topography" target="_blank">Ural mountains</a> in Russia as a case study. By all estimates, there hasn't been anything resembling active tectonics or volcanism in the Urals for ~250 million years but there is still a prominent mountain rage with peaks almost 2 km high. This begins to give the sense that topography can persist for quite a while even in the absence of 'active' tectonics (I'll explain the quotes in a moment).</p>
<p>Now, there are several important differences between Earth and Mars that might influence the persistence of topography. The first is the crustal structure. Mountains on both planets are 'supported' by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy" target="_blank">isostasy</a>. Isostasy is often discussed in terms of buoyancy with examples of icebergs and such, but closer to the truth is thinking of mountains as resting on an elastic sheet. The rigidity and thickness of that sheet controls how much the mountain 'sinks' for a given volume and density. This also means that if you remove mass from the mountain (you erode it and transport the sediment away) then the mountain will actually rebound a bit. This isostatic rebound is important in old mountain ranges on Earth because even as you remove mass (and reduce elevation), there is a response to return some of that elevation loss from the isostatic response. Now comparing Mars and Earth, the thickness of this elastic sheet is different, Mars has a much more rigid and thick sheet so this means that for every increment of erosion on Mars there will be less of an isostatic response, suggesting that the isostatic uplift component of mountain range longevity would be less on Mars. (Note, it's a common misconception that the differences in things like mountain range height etc on Mars vs Earth are due primarily to differences in gravitational acceleration, as I've explained several times before, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4jg0sv/if_tectonic_plates_didnt_move_would_hawaii_be/d36n45l/" target="_blank">this does play a role, but is subsidiary to the differences in the strength of the lithospheres of the two planets</a>).</p>
<p>In our hypothetical future where we've terraformed Mars, it also depends on how complete a job we've done (i.e. have we added a water cycle like we have on Earth along with global vegetation?). Vegetation plays a pretty important role in erosion, both as a stabilizing agent (keeping detritus in place) but also as a weathering agent (breaking rocks up). It's also essential in soil formation, and soil itself is crucial for how erosion works (how much moisture the soil can suck up as opposed to becoming runoff is an extremely important control on erosional processes in rivers). From a certain standpoint, landscape evolution models where we simulate erosion to calculate what topography would look like under given conditions might be a reasonable approximation of what could happen on a non-vegetated planetary surface. Most of these do not explicity include vegetation (although the empirical constants that pop up in these models/equations are calculated from Earth so vegetation etc is sort of factored in obliquely). Even in models, we see the persistence of topography for a long time (100s of millions of years) after active tectonics has ceased <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v498/n7455/full/nature12218.html" target="_blank">(e.g. this paper)</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terraforming itself isn't permanent. If we added a thicker atmosphere and warmed up Mars so it could have liquid water oceans, it might take hundreds or thousands of years to get there but then those conditions would only last for perhaps millions or tens of millions of years (discounting constant active maintenance). And the timescale of erosion would be on millions of years. While it might be worth planning ahead a few hundred or even thousands of years in some cases, it's almost certainly useless to do so out to millions of years. Our technological capabilities that far into the future will be so different we won't have the slightest clue how to meaningfully prepare for them other than in the most generic sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
