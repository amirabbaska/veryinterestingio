		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pins aren't to increase the security of your machine, they are to increase the security of your microsoft account.  </p>
<p>Pins are for logging into the particular machine/account combination, and passwords CAN be for this, but also can be (and what microsofts wants) be multiplatform/cloud based (microsoft account) wide.</p>
<p>Therefore, using your microsoft account to log into the computer creates a point of vulnerability for something much larger than just that computer.  If that password is compromised, a person has access to all of your platforms, and a vast amount of data.</p>
<p>If your pin is compromised, they only have access to that one computer, and perhaps your one drive. </p>
<p>There are also procedure issues.  Because people want to log on convienently, they may make easy password.  But because microsoft accounts are online and always vulnerable, AND worthwhile targets, it should never have a simple password.  Pins relieve this conflict, and so increase security of microsoft accounts this way as well.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Reading some posts made me realize that a lot of people missed a basic feature of the PIN.  The login PIN is only enterable by someone who is physically present.  </p>
<p>The PIN, like biometrics (the  other login feature added to win10) requires the operator to be physically in possession of the device, and manually interface with it.  So, brute forcing your PIN is a slow and bloody fingers affair, and the PIN can complement other features like a security camera.  So, the PIN is highly secure by design.</p>
<p>by that same note if you make it so that only your PIN, and not your microsoft account, worked to logon to the  machine, then switching to a PIN would make your machine more secure.  But, as it stands, if your microsoft account is compromised, then the attacker can access your machine without knowing your PIN.  This, coupled with the PIN being technically (though not meaningfully,) easier to guess manually, is why your PIN does not increase the security of the machine.  PINs increase the security of your microsoft account, which, defacto, increases the security of the machine.</p>
<p>If you want no exposure to microsoft account vulnerability, I believe you have to setup the PC with only a locally stored login.  That local only login/password would be more secure than a PIN.</p>
<p>IF you hear of someone logging in with a PIN remotely, then PINs become a huge liability until patched, and you should immediately disable it.  no human enterable number is going to be secure against a brute force attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are forgetting that this PIN only logs you into the machine LOCALLY. This isn't the same thing as having your password be your PIN. </p>
<p>So in theory, they're correct as no one is going to be at the machine long enough to try 10000 combinations. The Microsoft account's password can still be HolyCrapThisPasswordiSreaLLyLongandSECURE and be pretty safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Windows 10 explains this on the page that asks you to set up the pin when you click on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FxQ00Ho.png" target="_blank">how can a short pin be safer than a long password</a>.</p>
<p>The PIN only works on the device it is set up on and no other. So a (remote) hacker can't access your Microsoft account with the PIN because they would still need your full username and password for that.</p>
<p>So the fact they need both the device and the PIN is in itself a kind of two factor authentication.</p>
<p>Basically a PIN is not more secure than a password when used in the same kind of environment... but a local PIN adds an additional layer of security.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taken out of context, PINs are not safer than passwords. The argument that people will choose easy-to-remember passwords falls over once you start looking at dumps of PINs, where the most common ones are '0000', '1111', '1234', etc.</p>
<p>However, the PIN in this case isn't intended to secure an online account, which is where the real danger of weak passwords is exposed. The PIN setup is part of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn985839\(v=vs.85\).aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Passport</a>, which uses two-factor authentication (it identifies a familiar device <em>plus</em> a PIN <em>or</em> a biometric identification, like a picture or a fingerprint) to access your Microsoft-stored data. Microsoft is hoping that they can then start providing authentication-as-a-service, so that online services will be able to use an API to authenticate you using the two-factor Microsoft Passport authentication.</p>
<p>That would be a much more secure form of authentication than passwords currently are, not least because so many online services are just embarrassingly bad at handling password storage correctly, and because users have a tendency to reuse their passwords across a lot of services. So, you create an account for an order with &quot;Jimbob's Discount Gravedigging&quot;, then Jimbob's database gets ripped off and it turns out that they stored your email address and password in plain text, and you used the same password there that you use for everything else. Now someone has access to all of your everything.</p>
<p>If Microsoft can successfully take over authentication for Jimbob's, then if their database gets ripped off, the attacker doesn't get anything terribly useful. If someone manages to successfully compromise Microsoft's security, they still don't get passwords that they can try using elsewhere.</p>
<p>edit: wow, there are a stunning number of wrong answers in this thread. I guess that's the danger of asking computer security-related questions in /r/askscience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they're inherently safer, it's that they're meant to be used as part of a system with other secure identification measures, like biometrics, RFID tokens, faster password reattempt locking (since a PIN is simple, the system can expect fewer accidental misentrys) or log-in confirmation from a second device like a cellphone.</p>
<p>You are in fact correct that using only a PIN for log-in would be identical to using a four-digit password.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
