Humans seem to constantly get crooked teeth, misaligned teeth, underbites, overbites, wisdom teeth coming in sideways, etc.  Why is this?</p></div></div>

This made our mouth smaller, but we continued to grow the same amount of teeth. Same number of teeth in a smaller space means they come in compact and crooked. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Especially with carbohydrates such as sugar, bear, bread, juice, also milk is not good. These are unhealthy, both internally and externally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike most animals, human diets have undergone a relatively rapid change in a relatively short period of time. Take an animal species and you're looking a creature that's been eating the same general diet for the last...million years or so.</p>
<p>Take humans, however, and our diets have changed drastically in the past...tens of thousand years, which in evolutionary terms is break-neck speeds. We've gone from diets heavy in fibrous plant materials, which are tough and require a lot of chewing to fully utilize, to being able to eat an entire meal through a straw. Basically our early, early, early ancestors had to chew on really tough, hard foods. These required large jaws with lots of teeth in order to get more energy out of.</p>
<p>As our diets got softer, our ancestors could get away with smaller jaws - which required less energy to grow and use. Using less energy while still acquiring the same amount in your diet as your large-jawed brethren = advantage.</p>
<p>So our species have evolved much smaller jaws in a very short order of time...and basically these problems are issues left for us to deal with thanks to this rapid evolution of cramming a lot teeth into a smaller space. Were it not for dental medicine, for example, people born without (or fewer) wisdom teeth might have an evolutionary advantage and wisdom teeth could've been weeded out over a few thousands years. I, for example, only had three wisdom. If that had given me an advantage, then my children would likely have had only three and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Edit: So apparently people need to me to spell out the exact mechanics of natural selection at play or they presume I'm spouting some Lanarkian malarky. So 'if that had given me an advantage' is referring to increasing my likelihood of survival to reproduction age or increased likelihood of having reproductive success, the basis of natural selection. Thus I am referring to if wisdom gave me an increased chance of having reproductive success, then there is a greater chance of future generations having this trait of fewer wisdom teeth as well. Again, the basics of Natural Selection that I had erroneously presumed I would not need to spell out in greater detail. I keep mistaking ELI5 with 'ELI don't need the basics of evolution explained to me again'</p>
<p>Also, what I'm presenting is somewhat of an oversimplification of the leading hypothesis - if you want gross in-depth, I would suggest taking this to another subreddit like /r/askscience. There are, as others have pointed, other very valid and compelling theories about human jaw evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
