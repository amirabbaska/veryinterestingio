<p>I apologize if this is a stupid question.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radio waves themselves aren't stored, nor do they go anywhere.</p>
<p>Your phone is constantly pinging cell towers and communicating with your cell network. If your phone is not connected to the network, then the texts go into a holding queue on the towers/servers. Same as your voicemail notifications when you miss a call without signal.</p>
<p>Once your phone pings the network again, it will start running through that backlog of whatever was received. </p>
<p>It is only at that point that the radio waves, so to speak, would be sent out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, there is a piece of equipment that manages the SMS messages called a SMSC.  It's not free...  the towers don't queue the messages, rather the SMSC puts the messages in a delivery schedule that attempts to send to the phone, if it doesn't get a positive response it tries again shortly after.  The cycle continues until successful receipt.  The delay between attempts increases after every fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What does the postal service do if they try to deliver a package when you aren't home?  They hold onto it until you come pick it up or they try to deliver it later.  Texts work the same way.  Some server stores the message and tries to send it out later, or waits for your phone to reconnect and ask if it has any messages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While SMS has been described into detail, I figured I'd explain iMessage:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When sending an iMessage between iPhones; Apple's Push Notification Service (APN) is used. Basically, each iOS device has it's own set of public/private keys which are used to encrypt/decrypt messages between devices. At no point in time does Apple store these private keys on their servers. So essentially, the conversations between iOS devices are black-boxed. However, Apple does centralize the management of public keys so it's possible that Apple can send a public key that belongs to, lets say the FBI, and sends that key along with your recipients public key. Your iOS device would then encrypt said iMessage twice (using the FBI's key and your recipient's public key) and send it over to Apple's servers for storage. Regardless, the messages sit on Apple's servers in an encrypted state until the receiving iOS devices pull them. In the end, it does provide far more privacy over regular SMS communications.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wireless transmission from your phone is just the very last leg of what is any other connection to the internet.  The mobile network of cell towers are basically just access points, like a giant wifi network.  Even when in range, your mobile provider is just routing the messages to towers which are then on a wired connection to the internet, which then route it to servers the same as any other computer.  If they can’t transmit to your phone, they just hold on to it, same as an email.  When your phone comes back onto the network/internet, it lets the servers know “hey, I’m back” (or alternately, the servers just keep trying until they succeed) and the message then goes through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
