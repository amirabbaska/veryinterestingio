		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Even for a simple binary system like the Earth-Sun system, gravitational waves are constantly being produced. The reason is that such orbits cause a change in the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole" target="_blank">quadrupole moment</a> of the total mass distribution of the system. This change is the key requirement for shooting off gravitational waves. And yes, you are right, if the system is losing energy in this way, then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Binaries" target="_blank">orbits will decay over time</a>. In fact, this exact effect provided one of the earliest bits of indirect evidence for gravitational waves. When astronomers looked at a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary" target="_blank">pulsar-neutron star binary</a>, they saw that the period of the pulses was changing in a systematic way. The best explanation for this change is that the binary was experiencing orbital decay by losing energy through gravitational waves. </p>
<p>Now, it's worth pointing out that in most cases this effect is very, <em>very</em> weak. For example the Sun-Earth system loses about 200W due to gravitational waves. This is roughly the power of a couple of old incandescent light bulbs, which as you might guess is nothing on an astronomical scale. This energy loss causes the orbit to shrink by a measly 1*10^(-15)m per day, or about the size of an atomic nucleus. If you waited for the Earth and Sun to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mwSBZru.gifv" target="_blank">spiral inwards through this process</a> and crash together, you would have to wait more than 10^(13) times the age of the current universe! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its correct to say that gravitational waves cause orbital configurations to lose energy, but that doesn't necessarily mean all orbits are decaying, as other factors can impact orbits.</p>
<p>For example, tidal forces are currently causing the Moon to slow down the Earths rotation. This angular momentum lost by the Earth is causing the moon to gain linear momentum. This effect is much greater than energy loss due to gravitational waves, which is why the Moon is slowly moving farther away from the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes</p>
<p>Most of the answers below are complete nonsense</p>
<p>You are correct-even in the absence of atmosphere or tidal forces etc. etc., gravitational radiation means that every orbit will slowly radiate away it's energy. This is a very slow process  however  for ordinary gravitational fields such as Sun gravity at earth orbit</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
