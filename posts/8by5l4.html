Old computers had such a hard time handling it and keeping FPS up. Another meme in the PC gaming community is Crysis and if a computer could play it. The common similarity is that old machines struggled with them. If technology wasn't quite advanced enough to run them well, how were the developers able to make sure there were no bugs, and how did people play them, especially in open betas? Cheers, all.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gaming industry and the hardware manufacturers work hand in hand in some ways.</p>
<p>When you develop new hardware and want it to gain market shares, one of the easiest tricks is to make sure that there are products that actually need it.</p>
<p>For a graphics board, the trick is to make the prototype available for developers of graphics heavy software. CAD engine developers. Video editing developers. And, of course, game developers.</p>
<p>Making a decent game can take years. But when it is released it's mysteriously having full support for a super-groundbreaking graphics board that has also been developed for years already, that does things none of the competitors have ever been able to before.</p>
<p>That kind of thing is not really a mystery. The hardware developer wants the game to help with sales, so they have bene at the developer studio several times with prototypes, made sure the game runs smooth on the hardware and have made sure to plan the release with when the game comes out. Because they both benefit from helping each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a graphics developer for a big studio. We have very high end hardware for dev machines. My current machine is a 48 core dual xeon @ 2.5ghz, with a 1080ti and a Vega 64 so i can test both manufacturers. Not the best for gaming (lower clock speed) but great for compiling! QA will have faster clock speed machines that resemble consumer hardware, as well as more niche hardware setups like SLI / Crossfire. So the game normally runs fine on our machines. </p>
<p>We also do something akin to future proofing. Lets say the game is using 2K shadow maps and runs fine. We decide to up the shadow map resolution to 4K and we get perf hits. We can verify that the scene still looks correct, as it's a perf problem not a visual one. We may leave the option in there as video cards will eventually be able to run the 4K shadow map without issues. </p>
<p>Rendering algorithms are also highly parametric. Number of samples for a blur, how many lights we allow, how many marches for a ray march, texture resolution and anisotroic sample counts. We may expose these parameters without fully testing them. Hey they work for N, they work for N+1, they should work for N+2! Mostly because it's pretty much impossible to every configuration matrix possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game devs have high-end, cutting edge hardware - sometimes even pre-release stuff.  I was doing some database programming for a small (now defunct) game company <strong>back in 2010</strong> and my desktop (not even the machine the database was running on) had 24GB of RAM, a top-of-the-line i7 and some top of the line (GTX *80) graphics card.  Some of the devs had even <em>beefier</em> machines and this <em>was not</em> a AAA game title.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you can do a lot of testing against the game with graphics settings turned down to low.  Other testing can be done while expecting shit frame rates.  Once the game is finished, if it's a long development cycle, and the hardware you want to target is available, you can do some final testing but the majority of the work has been completed by that point &amp; you're just polishing things.</p>
<p>For consoles, you will often see development machines that have the power of the final machine but are <em>far</em> more expensive than the final device will be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answers:</p>
<p>1) You can do lots of development with a bad framerate. Most of what you need to do doesn't require the game to be running well, and most bugs will occur independent of framerate.</p>
<p>2) If performance really is crappy (like with a debug build, or when optimization is needed), you can just drop the graphics quality and resolution until it isn't.</p>
<p>3) You give nice machines to the devs that need them.</p>
<p>4) You cheat the situation if you have to, like working on combat in a level that is just a grey plane with bad guys standing on it. That way your machine isn't busy rendering trees and stuff that drag performance down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick thing here, pertaining to the last part of your question: Open betas were not as common in the past as they are now. Most games were released without &quot;open betas&quot; or &quot;early access.&quot; They just released completed games, and would release patches to fix any glaring problems. Betas and quality assurance testing were done in-house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
