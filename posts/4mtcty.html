		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a non-American and someone who hasn't studied economics, it is hard for me to understand the entirety of what John Oliver did. </p>
<p>It sounds like he did a really great job but my lack of understanding about the American economic and social security system is making it hard for me to appreciate it. </p>
<ul>
<li>Please explain in brief about the aspects of the American economy that this deals with and why is this a big issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow. This blew up. I just woke up and my inbox was flooded. Thank you all for the explanations. I'll read them all. </p>
<p>Edit 2: A lot of people asked this and now I'm curious too -</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't people buy their own debts by opening their own debt collection firms? Legally speaking, are they allowed to do it? I guess not, because someone would've done it already.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit 3: As /u/Roftastic put it: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where did the remaining 14 Million dollars go? Is that money lost forever or am I missing something here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you /u/mydreamturnip for explaining this. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4mtcty/eli5_what_exactly_did_john_oliver_do_in_the/d3z1n7w" target="_blank">Link to the comment</a>. If someone can offer another explanation, you are more than welcome.</p>
<p>Yes, yes John Oliver did a very noble thing but I think this is a legit question.</p>
<p>Upvote the answer to the above question(s) so more people can see it.</p>
<p>Edit 4: Thank you /u/anonymustanonymust for the gold. I was curious to know about what John Oliver did and as soon as my question was answered here, I went to sleep. I woke up to all that karma and now Gold? Wow. Thank you.</p></div></div>
