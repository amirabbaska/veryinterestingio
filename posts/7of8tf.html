		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably the most useful thing is the experience we gain in the hunt for the prime number. Writing programs to search for large primes is not trivial. Consider that the latest prime number is 23 million digits long. To store the number in its entirety takes about 10 Mb. People have to develop new algorithms to efficiently manipulate numbers this large. And once these algorithms have been developed they can be applied to other areas of research.</p>
<p>I'll also point out that the search for prime numbers helps generate interest in math. People can take part in the search at home. Some of these programs are run on home computers when they are idle. When people sign up for the programs they often do some self research to understand what their doing. This outreach aspect should not be underestimated in value.</p>
<p>Another point to make is the prime numbers are the building blocks of the integers. Every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. So studying the prime numbers  is an important part of number theory. Every time we discover a new prime there's a chance that it will hint at something new pattern that we have yet recognized. </p>
<p>At the same same time prime numbers have some interesting properties that were learning how to exploit. Encryption is often cited, but they can also be used for random number generation, and some other things. It's hard to imagine that a 23 million digit prime being useful today, but who knows what will happen in the future as computing continues to progress and people continue to test new ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's virtually no mathematical point to finding the actual primes. I say this as a number theorist. </p>
<p>Finding new large primes is mostly a computer science pursuit. What may be of actual interest is any new methods for finding primes, new optimizations to existing algorithms, or just faster computer hardware. These may find other uses, but the actual prime numbers themselves are almost entirely useless.</p>
<p>From a mathematician's point of view the discovery of the latest largest prime is not really any kind of breakthrough. It doesn't add anything significant to our mathematical knowledge. It's the same with digits of pi, for instance.</p>
<p>I think such accomplishments get news coverage in lieu of actual mathematical discoveries because they are understandable by interested laymen. This is partly because, unlike in say theoretical physics, the important open questions of pure math are not really discussed outside academia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large prime numbers are used to encrypt a message. Let's say N and M are two quite large prime numbers. Then calculating N x M is quite easy for a computer, but give the computer the product N x M and ask it to find N and M and it could take almost forever if N and M are large enough. One could look at encryption as computing N x M and trying to decrypt as factorizing the product of N x M. The larger the primes, the safer the encryption.</p>
<p>Actual encryption is more complicated of course, and there are other methods as well, but I've shared enough to understand why you need the large primes.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, the really big prime numbers are probably not used for encryption, but large primes in general are. So this is not really answering OP's question, but maybe it enlightens the general usage of large primes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
