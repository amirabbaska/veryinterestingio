		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first place that a motor error is detected is the cerebellum (as quickly as 10-100 ms) where the firing of your Purkinje neurons encodes what is expected to happen. If there is sensory feedback that is in some way not &quot;predicted&quot; (as current theories go...) then &quot;error signals&quot; (&quot;climbing fibers&quot; which project from...many places... god knows where) come back and say &quot;things are not going as planned...correct the signal!&quot;. A massive error signal causes a huge feeling of unease in balance (vestibular system), visual cortex (things seems to &quot;jump out&quot; when unexpected), and motor cortex (you might suddenly change your planned action mid-action without thinking). </p>
<p>These responses are all downstream of the deep cerebellar nuclei. These nuclei, located way deep by your brainstem, are super complex fast coincidence detectors of the spiking of millions of Purkinje cells up in the cerebellum and relay to all these other areas. The best mechanistic theory as to how these cells detect a change in Purkinje cell syncrony indicating an error still cannot explain how these cells do it so quickly unfortunately. After the fact a large activation probably does release all kinds of adrenaline, etc but on a slower timescale. Your body has to react a lot quicker than that and the &quot;oh shit!&quot; feeling is probably your &quot;after-awareness&quot; of this massive activation. Your brain often reacts to make sure you won't die before you are even aware. </p>
<p>This explanation sounds great, and makes 100x more sense than the other explanations here but you quickly realize there is still a lot of hand-waving going on in the details, like ...&quot;where does the error signal come from?&quot; I forgot you are 5. Neuroscience is not for five-year olds--I'm a mid-30s researcher and I'm pretty sure there are many pieces in this puzzle we still don't understand even in middle-aged language. Hope this gives you some directions to read in!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people in here are saying it's adrenaline. It's not adrenaline (in the hormonal sense. See edit). Some of you posted some good sources indicating how easily adrenaline is spread throughout the body thanks to the blood volume / vascularity of the kidneys, on top of which the adrenal glands sit. This is accurate, but I think OP is talking about the sudden &quot;oh shit&quot; feeling we get, and adrenaline takes a few good heart pumps to get coursing through your veins and start affecting the various systems it needs to affect.</p>
<p>That sudden electric feeling is probably a LOT of neurons firing. Your brain just noticed some bad shit is about to happen, so it's activating as much as it can to prepare for what's next. Your pupils dilate, your hairs stand on end. Your heart rate increases.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is slower-working. It will trigger things like breakdown of stored carbohydrates to help you do work over time.</p>
<p>Edit: The main argument against my explanation was that adrenaline (epinephrine / norepinephrine) is used as a neurotransmitter (released by neurons rather than by adrenal glands, in which case they would be considered hormones). Fair enough. I honestly wish I'd taken a second to think of which neurotransmitter was affecting these responses. Hope I didn't confuse anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instantaneous response is due to your sympathetic nervous system responding to environment. This is almost instantaneous because it's a series of electrical impulses rather than a biochemical pathway. When adrenaline hits it takes a little longer but is still very quick. Adrenaline is released very quickly and causes a cascade activating cAMP which in turn activates several PKAs all exponentially leading to phosphorylations the lead to glycogen being converted to a glucose derivative causing the muscle contractions etc. </p>
<p>Edit: took out the para. Changed uncles
Edit: honestly didn't think anyone was going to actually see this comment so i didn't simplify, I'll re explain in an ELI5 manner</p>
<p>--When adrenaline is released in the system these molecules rush through the body activiting a molecule called cAMP. These cAMP molecules are now active and can do their job, which in this case is to activity an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase A, or PKA. This PKA then activates another enzyme called phosphorylase. This in turn activates the glycogen to glucose pathway. From glucose, the energy of the body is made and thus the symptoms of adrenaline arise.</p>
<p>Super ELI5: Phosphates being added to stuff </p>
<p>Fun Fact: adrenaline is a brand name for epinephrine which is what adrenaline is actually biochemically called</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instant effect is your sympathetic nervous system firing. Your brain senses danger and then activates the nerves which very rapidly cause affects such as increased heartrate and diverting blood from the stomach to the mucles. Adrenaline is also released but takes longer to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
