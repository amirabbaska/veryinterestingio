		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moon does have a magnetic field but compared to Earth it's very very weak and also it isn't a 'dipolar' magnetic field like Earth's (Magnetic field generated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory" target="_blank">geodynamo</a> in planet's core). Magnetization that is present on Moon is crustal in origin. As for Planets, some do and some don't. Recent probe founding indicates that Mars and Venus don't have any significant magnetic field whereas Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all have magnetic fields that are far stronger than Eath's.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! So the necessary (but not sufficient) ingredients for a generated magnetic field are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A liquid thing that conducts electricity</li>
<li>Enough thermal+compositionally driven convection that is vigorous enough.</li>
<li>Some rotation. Now the rotation constraint is weaker than people think. Basically rotation needs to be fast compared with velocities. There is a technical definition of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick tour of our solar system:</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong>: The magnetic field is dipolar, but the magnetic equator is displaced northward by like 20% of the planets radius (on earth it is coincident with the actual equator). It is also 100x weaker than it should be from simplistic force balance arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Venus</strong>: No magnetic field, probably not enough heat is coming out of the core. This is likely due to sluggish mantle convection (which is the thing that removes heat from the core). This is a whole new (but super interesting) topic. Because the entire surface of Venus is quite new, we also don't know if it ever had one. There is a lot we don't know about Venus.</p>
<p><strong>Earth</strong>: Has a magnetic field</p>
<p><strong>Mars</strong>: Used to have a magnetic field, it went away. There are a bunch of theories about why. Mars definitely has a liquid core though, it probably isn't convecting vigorously enough</p>
<p><strong>Jupiter/Saturn</strong>: The electrically conducting fluid here is high pressure hydrogen, which conducts eletricity like a metal if you squeeze it hard enough. These generate dipolar magnetic fields similar to the earth (oversimplification, they have their own mysteries)</p>
<p><strong>Neptune/Uranus</strong>: They generate highly non-dipolar magnetic fields, your compass would point in all sorts of different directions depending on where you are on the planet. The conducting fluid here is things like ammonia, which under pressure weakly conduct electricity.</p>
<p>There are also moons that have (Ganymede) or had (our own moon) magnetic fields. These were generated largely like earths. In the case of our moon, it is pretty small so it lost its heat quickly. Now the liquid core (which actually still exists as a liquid) isn't having enough heat drawn from it to convect, so no magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most planetary bodies with strong magnetic poles have liquid metal cores that rotate setting up a dynamo effect.   Geologically dead worlds like the Moon don't have that.  If they have any fields it's from the residual effects of a piece of metal left in a magnetic field.</p>
<p>Jupiter has a huge magnetic pole and magnetic field, Mars doesn't have strong poles.  </p>
<p>Essentially, bigger planets take longer to cool and are more likely to have them, smaller planets are less likely to have strong magnetic fields due to solid cores.  Small planets and moons under strong gravitational fields can sometimes squish and kneed the core of the planet to keep it geologically active.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
