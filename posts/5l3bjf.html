		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/OrbitalPete is a volcanologist based at a university in the UK. He got his PhD in 2010, and has since worked in several countries developing new lab techniques, experiments, and computer models. He specialises in using flume experiments to explore the behaviour of pyroclastic density currents from explosive eruptions, but has also worked on volcanic earthquakes, as well as research looking at submarine turbidity currents and how they relate to oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p>He's watched volcanoes erupt, he's spent lots of time in the field digging up their deposits, and he's here to answer your questions (starting at 12 ET, 16 UT)!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two questions if you do not mind.<br />
Scientists are sometimes known for not communicating their science to the none-scientific community too well. How would you suggest scientists communicate their science better to get more people interested in science?
Secondly, I am currently applying for volcanology PhD's and wonder how much doing a specific PhD would confine me to that specialty in the future? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
