		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine its because indirect sunlight is not enough to get a tan. You can stay in a well lit room all you want, if you're not in the actual sunshine, you're not going to get a tan. And consider that it takes several minutes or tens of minutes of being out in the sun to start tanning.</p>
<p>Seeing how our eyes are organic lenses and direct sunlight tends to burn them out, I think you can deduce why we can't exactly tan our eyes :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, I have a definitive answer. There is a pretty simple difference between cutaneous melanocytes (melanin producing cells in your skin) and uveal melanocytes (melanin producing cells in the uvea or middle layer of your eye that includes the iris). The melanocytes in your skin are stimulated to begin melanogenisis (making the sweet sweet melanin) by hormones called melanotropins. The primary melanotropin that mediates your skins UV response is alpha-MSH. The melanocytes in your eye do not respond to this hormone. That's it. The pigmentation of your iris is not affected by the suns rays. Doesn't mean it won't burn them though :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Your eye can get a sun-tan and a sun-burn, but this will cause permanent damage. The white of your eye does not tan because it does not have the ability to produce pigment. The iris of your eye has the ability to get a tan, but doing so would require active effort, a lot of pain, and would cause permanent damage to your vision.</p>
<hr />
<p>You may recall from the last eclipse that there was a lot of whooplaah regarding eye damage from looking directly at the event. Your eye can get a sunburn, and that causes permanent damage to your eye if the inside of the eye is burned.</p>
<p>1) The Sclera (White of your Eye)</p>
<p>The reason that your skin tans is because UV light causes the skin to produce pigment - the more pigment produced the darker your tan. There are cells called melanocytes and they are light sensitive, but they are burried under a couple layers of skin. UV light can pass through the upper layers of skin, and when they get to the melanocytes it causes them to produce melanin (pigment).</p>
<p>This is why sunlight will give you a tan, but your bedroom lamp will not. It has to have concentrated UV lengths.</p>
<p>As time passes, your outer layer of skin dies and is shed, and new layers of skin are created deep inside you, and everything shifts outward. This means that the melanin-rich cells will eventually dry up and get blown away - and your tan will fade - as your layers of skin shift.</p>
<p>The white skin of the eye is called sclera and it is built different from your normal skin. It is mostly collagen - a strong connective tissue like what tendons are made of. There are very few melanocytes in the sclera, so there is nothing to produce the 'tanned pigment' to change color. When the sclera is burned it turns red due to increased blood flow.</p>
<p>However, some individuals who suffer from melanoma <em>do</em> have large amounts of melanocytes in their sclera or deeper regions of their eye. When these regions of their eye start to tan from exposure to the sun, it causes pain and eventually turns into a tumor. The tumor eventually destroys the eye.</p>
<p>2) The Iris (Colored portion of your Eye)</p>
<p>The iris is over 50% melanocyte, and the melanin produced plays a large part in determining eye color. The melanocytes react to UV light just like your skin, however, they receive much less UV light than the rest of your body. Remember, it isn't <em>sunlight</em> that gives you a tan, but the <em>UV portion</em> of sunlight.</p>
<p>When sunlight hits an object, that object reflects portions of the light but most of the UV energy is absorbed. Very few objects reflect more than 10% of the UV light that hits them (that's why sunlight warms us up). So if you look a tree out in a field the sunlight is hitting the tree, the UV is absorbed, then the light bounces off and hits your eye. That's a lot less UV energy, so the melanocytes in the iris don't react very much.</p>
<p>Additionally, the iris is not on the surface of the eye. There is a clear dome called the cornea, and between the dome and the iris is a liquid called aqueous humor (intraocular fluid). Both of these structures, but especially the fluid, have proteins that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6773294" target="_blank">scatter and absorb UV light</a> before it gets to the melanocytes in the iris. Effectively, your eye contains a sunscreen for your iris.</p>
<hr />
<p>All of this is to say that if you were to look directly into a UV lamp you would be able to tan your iris, but it would do so at a slower rate than your skin, and this would cause permanent damage to your eye and ruin your vision, and you'd develop blind spots before any noticeable difference occurred in your pigmentation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can tell, the explanation is that the <del>lens of the eye</del> cornea filters out UV light, so there is no UV (which triggers melanin darkening and generation) actually reaching the melanin in your iris.~~</p>
<p>EDIT: Initially I thought it was the lens, as it also acts as a UV protector, but people, correctly, pointed out I know jack shit about eye anatomy and the lens is behind the iris.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The melanocytes in your eye do not respond to the hormone responsible for tanning by increasing melanin production.</p>
<p>That being said, UV still hits them.  That UV still damages DNA and can still cause a melanocyte to turn cancerous.</p>
<p>Ocular melanoma is a thing, and very frequently fatal, because people don’t think to check for it, it rarely has symptoms until too late, and it’s usually spread to inoperable areas once discovered.</p>
<p>The only way to find it is via a optometrist exam, and unless you wear glasses/contacts and get them regularly, you probably never get checked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
