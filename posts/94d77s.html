The temperature and pressure keep up and it remains liquid all the way down.  There is no point where the heat boils it away and it dries up or where the pressure forces it into some of the exotic solid ice states.  It's not just the ocean, the water table under continental land does the same thing.  Mines and deep holes are constantly battling to pump water out to keep the tunnels from flooding.  It's wet turtles, all the way down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me give this a shot - I'm a third-year Earth Sciences student.</p>
<p>First, let me make another key assumption - we will assume you are digging in unfractured ocean crust (i.e. there is no brittle deformation of the crust in your locality that will impact the saturation of the crust). Obviously the crust will be saturated near such fractures, and (from my sedimentology course), such fractures are common enough and do lead to alteration of the nearby rock. This is how hydrothermal vents are thought to function - water seeps in through cracks, comes in contact with a magma chamber, and then is ejected along with dissolved metals.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with answering this specific question is that the presence of water in those layers (which is clear from other comments) isn't specific enough - it's whether sea water can penetrate that far into the rock without relying on fractures (which would be spatially variable).</p>
<p>The main answer will be based on porosity. If the rock is porous, there will be water for some depth beneath it. From what I remember of geochemistry, most of the mafic rocks at this point are slightly porous (supported: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL018412" target="_blank"><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL018412" target="_blank">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL018412</a></a>), and obvious the sediments are porous (though lithified sediment, less so). I therefore think that water would extend at least some distance past the sediment-basalt layer.</p>
<p>There is evidence (e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-017-1418-1" target="_blank"><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-017-1418-1" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00410-017-1418-1</a></a>) that water can penetrate up to 10 km into the crust (which actually puts it into the mantle in most cases in the ocean), though of course it may rely on fractures to do so. Also, a spreading ridge isn't the best example - the presence of pillow lavas within the crust indicate that they formed in contact with water to start with. We care more about already-formed crust.</p>
<p>I can't find any really good solid answers on this. It seems likely to penetrate some distance, and we could probably use the permeability and composition of the oceanic crust to determine how far, but I can't run the numbers for you. However, cracking of the crust is so common that I think you are unlikely to find any significant region where water does not penetrate down to ductile deformation depths (where rock bends instead of breaking). Under the ocean crust, ductile deformation would only start within the mantle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since everyone cant seem to just answer the question;</p>
<p>The short answer is: There is no point in which the material is dry.</p>
<p>The long answer is as follows.</p>
<p>Aside from pockets of gas, the material beneath the floor of the ocean is never dry. This is because, as the pressure increases beneath the ocean floor water becomes more difficult to turn into a gas. </p>
<p>All the way down until you meet molten rock, you find water or some other form of liquid.</p>
<p>This is why another commentor said that something always fills the space between rock.</p>
<p>In laymans term, dry means that a material has not been permeated with any liquid. However, aside from pockets of gas you'll find that all material under the ocean is permeated with some form of liquid. That liquid at some point is molten rock.</p>
<p>However, even if you consider dry as &quot;without water&quot; you'll find that water seeps down all the way till it meets molten rock and vaporizes, creating pockets of gas beneath the earth's surface.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify something. Magma can be considered as dry if you consider only water as wet. So you could find dry material as close as 7k feet, or as far as 1800 miles depending on location with no real known average, but I assume that sort of lack of knowledge isnt in the spirit of this post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
