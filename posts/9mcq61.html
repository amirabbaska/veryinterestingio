		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is one of the most complex machines ever built. Basically every component there has been developed specifically for ITER and there is a huge number of them. The tools to build them have to be developed. The parts have to be built - often one by one. Everything has to be tested, first in isolation and then as part of larger subsystems, and then the subsystems together, and so on. If something doesn't work the scientists have to find the reason and fix it. Even it works you have to analyze the data from tests to verify that everything works. All that takes years.</p>
<p>If no further delays come up until 2025 the scientists might be confident that they can create a first plasma by then. Probably with a low number of particles and at a low temperature. Probably with helium instead of hydrogen as that is easier. Then they will look at the results from that - is everything still as expected? Probably some machine parameters need adjustment. Then you have to test the new parameters. Probably over multiple iterations. After a while the machine is understood well enough to use normal hydrogen. Then deuterium. Then deuterium at slowly increasing density and temperature. And so on.</p>
<p>Most of ITER's goals can be achieved with deuterium alone. The plasma physics is basically the same for pure deuterium and a deuterium/tritium mix. The latter makes the reactor walls radioactive, once they start using tritium it will be difficult to change something inside the reactor. Therefore this will be done only after years of tests with deuterium, once they are sure the reactor can stay as it is and once the tests that don't need tritium are largely done.</p>
<p>I'm not working on fusion but the concept is very similar for particle accelerators and detectors where I see that process live. The LHC had first beams 10 years ago. It still didn't reach its full design energy (although it is close: ~7% below it since 2015). The collision rate is now twice the design value but the machine needed years to get there. The next upgrade phase will start in a few weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
