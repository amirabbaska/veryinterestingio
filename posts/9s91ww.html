		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought suppressing your emotions was bad for you, thats what id always hear from people, but in my psychology class some times ago i read about a study done with kids and a mean strict teacher (i might try looking up the study later).</p>
<p>(to crudely paraphrase, during a break one half of the class was told to sit in a corner quietly and reflect, while the second half was told to punch a bag with a picture of the teachers face on it (or something like that), and after the break they were all given blow horns and told they could freely blow the horn in the teachers face, and they found the kids who quietly reflected would blow the horn less.)</p>
<p>Anyways, after learning about this I tried looking up the answer online, came upon multiple opinion articles and sensational news sites which say it is harmful but would never cite anything, and the academic sources I found though were conflicting.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Dr. Gabor Mate's book &quot;When the Body Says No,&quot; he explores, with scientific rigor and literature review, how harboring emotions is tied to many different diseases.  Carrying emotional stress, even at a subconscious level, causes the body's stress response system to always be switched on.  Our bodies continuously produce the stress hormones: cortizol, adrenaline, and/or others (if memory serves).   These hormones then flow constantly or frequently in our bloodstream for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>We evolved with our stress response system for short bursts of energy, to win a fight, to escape a predator, to paralyze, freeze, and hide from terror.  Lives filled with constant financial stress, housing/food insecurity, living with abusers (parents/spousal/elder), childhood trauma (see the ACES Study) routinely trigger our stress hormones.  These hormones eventually pickle the most susceptible organs/systems in our bodies as defined by genetics and our lifestyle and are linked to: dementia, ALS, alzheimer's, cancer, arthritis, inflammation, IBS, crohn's disease, acne, asthma, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, other autoimmune disorders, ADD/ADHD and more...</p>
<p>TLDR: Yes and it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the best sources of information on this topic, IMHO, is Robert Sapolsky's work on baboons.</p>
<p>They all eat and exercise similarly, and their natural biology isn't worlds different from human biology. He studies stress hormones, cardiovascular health, etc. in long-term studies of their behavior and blood work.</p>
<p>Baboons that don't express aggression, in his studies, have worse health outcomes, associated with the negative effects of long-term elevated catecholamine levels.</p>
<p>His book, <em>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</em>, is a good and accessible pop-science treatment of this overall topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
