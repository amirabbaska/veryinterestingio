		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" target="_blank">skin effect</a> causes ac current to flow only on the surface, but the depth of that surface layer depends on frequency.  It only gets small at high frequency.  At 60 Hz, it's about a cm in copper. So it's only if you have giant busbar types of conductors that that becomes a significant effect.</p>
<p>But in an electrical power substation or transmission line, where you do have giant conductors, they are sometimes hollow.  And cables used for transmission lines usually have a steel core, mostly for strength, but also because the low conductivity of steel doesn't matter much for the core where not much current is flowing anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And they are. Steel core cables being the most common but the most awesome use of copper tubes are with Rigid Coaxial Cables, where cable is an oxymoron as they look more like waterpipes than electrical wires. They are used in broadcast towers to get the high power, very high frequency signal to travel from A to B.</p>
<p>This is not waterpipes, those are all &quot;cables&quot;: <a href="http://sg-transcom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DSC01073.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="http://sg-transcom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DSC01073.jpg" target="_blank">http://sg-transcom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DSC01073.jpg</a></a> As you google them, try to add &quot;waveguide&quot; at the end, those things really do looks like they are ripped from scifi. And to add to the complexity of the whole thing: those cables have to be within tenth of a millimeter same length after hundred meters snaking around the tower.. We are dealing with frequencies so high that a small misalignment will throw the whole thing off, you are causing phasing issues at the speed of light so... we are at gigahertz range. where things really, really start to resemble scifi set the higher we go in f..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  In the electric utility industry we use hollow aluminum tubes for high-voltage bus inside substations and receiving stations.  It is impractical in small diameter because tubing wants to crimp or collapse when bent around a curve.  However, it works great for large diameter, straight, rigid bus work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, what effect, if any, does 3D printed parts have on the flow of electricity?  Depending on the technology, 3D printed metal parts can be solid, solid-ish, or have a honeycomb (or similar) interior structure which reduces the amount of material needed, makes it lighter, but also reduces it's strength.  How does electricity flow inside that honeycomb infill?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More commonly, multiple conductors are used. Look closely at large power pylons - many of them have several bundled conductors. Once you get more than about 1&quot; in diameter (at 60Hz), your best option is to use another conductor. Way easier than trying to make a large hollow one (in most cases)</p>
<p>For high frequency AC, litz wire is the same idea - multiple parallel conductors, all insulated from each other. again, way more practical than using a tube in most cases</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
