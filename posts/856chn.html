The roots are surrounded by blood vessels that can deliver healing resources, but there is no blood going to the top of your teeth. </p>
<p>Your saliva <em>can</em> provide a limited amount of healing to the enamel because of the calcium in contains, but it's very minor, and more of a maintenance process, rather than true healing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeth can sort of heal. </p>
<p>There are three layers to the crown of a tooth: enamel on the outside, dentin under that, and the dental pulp at the core. The dental pulp constantly produces dentin throughout life (very slowly) and sometimes produces dentin in response to a bacterial assault on the tooth (i.e. cavities). If the pulp manages to lay down enough new dentin from the inside, it can prevent a pulp exposure, which would necessitate a root canal or extraction.</p>
<p>The enamel, however, cannot regenerate. The cells that produce enamel (called ameloblasts) all die before the teeth erupt. Weak spots in the enamel can <em>remineralize</em> via fluoride toothpaste, but new enamel cannot be produced. Once bacteria and acid have eaten their way past the enamel, the tooth must be cavity prepped and filled before the infection reaches the pulp, as dentin is much softer and more permeable than enamel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although our teeth can't really repair themselves... There may be something that can help them to do so. </p>
<p>There is an Alzheimer's drug that had shown the ability to encourage a tooth to regrow dentine. This could drastically reduce the need for a lot of expensive dental work. Sounds like the drug is put into a sponge material and applied to the tooth which will then regrow dentine that replaces the sponge and fills the cavity. Unfortunately, it hasn't been tested on humans yet...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every tissue in the body works in diferent ways.
Bone for example has two opposite working cells, osteoblasts (which sinthesize new bone tissue), and osteoclasts (which destroy bone tissue), we need them working in synchronicity because if the osteoblasts work too much or were the only working our bones would deform because of the constant grow. On the other hand, if the osteoclasts were the only working or were working too much, our bones would be frail and brittle.</p>
<p>And, ok, I'm a little rusted on dental histology. But as far as I remember teeth are formed by ameloblasts (that grow the hard tissue of the teeth) and odontoblasts (that grow the soft innards of a tooth, like nerves). Ameloblasts die off after we have permanent teeth, so that is the reason why we can't heal chipped teeth or regrow them if they fall, we just stop having the necessary cells to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
