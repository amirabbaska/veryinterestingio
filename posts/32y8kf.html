		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way that you digital watch does.</p>
<p>There are different methods but usually there is a small quarts crystal somewhere in you computer, that vibrates at a very specific frequency. The frequency is fixed and physical property of the crystal. It is like a tuning fork which can only generate one fixed note no matter how you strike it.</p>
<p>They crystal vibrates because of electricity and generates pulses of electricity from its vibrations. Since the frequency of these pulses are will known you can easily figure out how much time passes by counting the pulses. A 16Mhz crystal for example will generate 16,000,000 pulses per second.</p>
<p>The computer regularly checks the clock or gets interrupted by it and it can easily figure out how much time has passed between one point or another by counting the pulses in between.</p>
<p>There is a small battery in your computer to keep the clock going so it will know how much time has passed while it was turned of.</p>
<p>The computer can also check external time services via a network connection to ensure that it has the correct time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your computer has a slice of rock in it that moves back and forth when you run electricity through it.  It counts the number of times it moves back and forth, and it knows how many times it moves back and forth in one second.  When it has moved back and forth the correct number of times, it knows one second has passed.</p>
<p>--edit--</p>
<p>Thank you all for liking my answer so much.  I am really grateful for the huge positive response it has gotten!</p>
<p>To answer the single most asked question:
When the power is off, there is a small battery on the motherboard that provides enough power to run the quartz timer, which is known as the CMOS battery.  When that battery dies or is removed, the time will reset to a default value every time the computer loses power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the components on your computer's motherboard is a Real Time Clock (RTC). It is powered by the CMOS battery and is also available to be read by your operating system (OS), in order to keep the OS's time and date correct. </p>
<p>The OS periodically will synchronize with a Time Server at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and update the RTC to keep the time on your computer accurate.</p>
<p>Fun fact: The first PCs did not have RTCs on the motherboard and therefore did not keep time. Soon after PCs were introduced, an aftermarket add-in card became available to install an RTC. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The computer does not know exacrly how long a second is, but it knows it good enough for a month or two. There is crystal on the mother board which will oscillate with a certain frequency, which can be used to calculate how long a second is. But to be fully exact, the time calculated can drift a few seconds per month or year. To correct for this the computer has to be synchronized with a time server that has a more exact time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are usually two clocks. One is inherrent and is used to generate the timing for the logic of the CPU and like a watch,  is usually based on counting the vibrations of a quartz crystal (which tends to be very co0nstant). As a &quot;side effect&quot;, it can be counted inside the processor and is available to a program. All this does is say how many clock ticks have elapsed. There is usually a way in which a program can be interrupted after a certain number of ticks. In this way we can set the overall responsiveness of a system when a processor has many different jobs to process. Typically on a Linux system, that is happening about 1000 times a second. As part of the timing process, it will keep track of how much time is passing by calculating the elapsed number of &quot;ticks&quot; since the previous interruption.</p>
<p>Of course, the processor can stop. For this case, there is a separate battery backed clock (although these days, it can be a high value capacitor). This is maintains a count, even when the system is powered off and is used to initialise the normal processor clock on boot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
