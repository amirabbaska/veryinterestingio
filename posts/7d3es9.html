		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I noticed a duel of sorts between a moth and a spider just now where I was certain the moth was doomed as it flew into the section where a spider had firmly set up its web, but as it flapped its wings so quickly it tore apart the web, and even sent the spider fleeing. </p>
<p>I don't know if this in itself was an adaption to webs, in fact I'd say from an uneducated standpoint that I doubt it... but it did make wonder if there were other insects which had developed natural tools against spider webs. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There are wasps which specialise in preying on spiders. Some even go so far as to kill the spider, then use their web to line their nests. I tried to find something interesting on the <em>Trypoxylon</em> genus, but they're such a bunch of trouble to ID that there's not much written.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many insects have evolved to evade spider webs, some have even figured out ways to use them for their own purposes!</p>
<p>The scales on moth and butterfly wings allow them to escape webs. The scales pull off freeing the wing when they get stuck.</p>
<p>There is also a tribe of true bugs called thread leg bugs (emesinae) that have modified fore tarsi they use to pluck spider webs, making the spiders think there is prey in the web. When the spiders run out to attack, the thread leg bugs eat the spider. They then move into the web and eat any insects that get stuck in the web.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this talk about her book about the evolution of spiders, Leslie Brunetta talked about the ongoing evolutionary arms race between insects and spider webs.  As well as a lot of other fascinating things about the evolution of spider silk and webs:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl8Je-mbD3I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl8Je-mbD3I</a></p>
<p>I was at the talk in person, so I remember she talked about the question you're asking, but I forget right now exactly what part of the talk it was at - it may have been partly during the Q&amp;A.  But I recommend the whole talk (and the book too).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Malabar tree-nymph (Idea malabarica) is a special butterfly in India that, as a butterfly eats a poisonous plant known as Dogbane. I LOVES dogbane. so much so that when it becomes a butterfly, the poison of the dogbane is INFUSED into its body as a selfdefense system. </p>
<p>I watched it on BBC's Wildest Islands and an Orb weaver caught one, got a taste of the poison and cut it free to get away from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
