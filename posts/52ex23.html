		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just adding a bit to the answer given by /u/brandonsmash. If you are asking if the test explosion in North Korea physically triggered this earthquake in South Korea, you can think of it in the same terms of natural earthquake triggering. There are two physical mechanisms where earthquakes can trigger one another. One of these is static stress triggering and one is dynamic stress triggering. </p>
<p>Earthquakes have triggered other earthquakes across long distances (1000+ km) through dynamic stress triggering. This occurs when an already stressed fault is near the breaking point, then the surface waves of a large earthquake pass by and throw that last straw on top to make the fault rupture. Remember that there are earthquakes much, much larger than these tests that do not seem to trigger any seismicity. Some do, and you can read about those in this recent paper published in Science [<a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/study-finds-earthquakes-can-trigger-near-instantaneous-aftershocks-different-faults" target="_blank">summary article</a> / <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/1133" target="_blank">Fan and Shearer, Science, 2016</a>].</p>
<p>There is also static triggering which is more like a domino effect. That's where one bit of fault ruptures and puts added stress on an adjacent fault, pushing it over the brink and causing it to rupture. This is only relevant over distances of about one fault length, so over a few hundred kilometers for a big M8 or 9 but a much smaller distance (~10 kilometers) for an M6 or less.</p>
<p>So because the North Korean test was relatively small and about 500 km from the South Korean earthquake the strain transfer would be too localized for static triggering, and because the earthquake occurred days after the test the timing is too late for dynamic triggering. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're able to pinpoint the hypocenter of the earthquakes in South Korea. They're located near Gyeongju, which is an inland area. The North Koreans would have had to tunnel for several hundred kilometers to plant explosives underneath Gyeongju or somehow smuggle them across the eastern coastline inland and then detonate them underground, which would have been tremendously obvious. It seems safe to say that the South Korean earthquakes were not, in fact, seismic events triggered by nuclear detonations.</p>
<p>According to the USGS, while a subterranean nuclear test can trigger localized seismic events due to a release of tectonic pressure, this effect is limited to a few tens of kilometers and doesn't extend down the fault line across days or larger geographical distances (<a href="https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/node/3339" target="_blank">https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/node/3339</a>).</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence indicating that a nuclear test conducted underground, no matter how strong, is not strong enough to trigger down-fault tectonic activity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not impossible. but highly unlikely. The earthquake in South Korea occurred in the southern part of the country. The North Korean &quot;shake&quot; was in the northern part of that country.</p>
<p>There is no major fault line running through N or S Korea.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is one of confirmation. We know that some quakes are a response to large, more distant quakes. The quake in W. Yellowstone some years ago might have triggered a Cali quake.</p>
<p>We'd have to see multiple nuke explosions highly correlating with significant after following quakes in order to be sure. Right now, the association doesn't rise above background noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The DOE investigated a potential link in the 60s, and found that while there was a very slight increase in west coast earthquake frequency that coincided with testing at the nevada test range, that it is purely coincidental; and that the rate has continued post-cessation of testing.</p>
<p>Given that NK/SK is on a tectonic plate (the Amurian plate) that is considered relatively stable in comparison to the west coast's active fault lines, or even around the area where India and Pakistans tests were conducted, it's unlikely that NK has triggered something that has not been observed with tests 'near' active fault lines.</p>
<p>Tectonic Weaponry has been outlawed since 1978, which NK ratified in 1984, so if NK were found to have caused an earthquake intentionally then they'd be in slightly more trouble than they already are, I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
