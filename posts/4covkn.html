		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thermoreceptors in your skin send signals towards your brain when there is a <em>change in temperature</em>.</p>
<p>When you have exposed yourself to cold water, you feel the immediate change in temperature at the surface of your skin. At this point, your sympathetic nervous system (which controls the unconscious 'fight or flight' responses) will stimulate the release of hormones which begin to cause vasoconstriction in your skin, arms and legs.</p>
<p>Your extremities will reduce in temperature, and the temperature gradient between the water and your core will reduce, along with the feeling of 'cold'. Heat flow is proportional to temperature gradient, so you will actually lose less heat. Diminished skin and extremity blood flow increases the thermal insulation of those superficial tissues more than 300% [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929604" target="_blank">1</a>].</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My background in this isn't as a scientist, but I have written more about cold water swimming than probably any non-academic. I'm a mod of /r/swimming, English Channel solo swimmer, and the 70th person in the world to complete an Ice Mile (one mile in water under 5C ~ 36F, without a wetsuit or any protection. I also write the world's most popular non-commercial open water swimming blog. <a href="http://loneswimmer.com/cold-water-swimming-articles-index/" target="_blank">Here is a collection of 50+ articles I've written about cold water swimming</a>. </p>
<p>So this is a complex subject that keeps me going. I'll touch on a few notable items below, so it may seem a bit disjointed as I find it hard to distil this subject.</p>
<p>The two immediate factors in cold water swimming are </p>
<ol>
<li>Habituation.</li>
<li>Acclimatization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Habituation is the process of getting used to getting into cold water (that is under 18 Celsius for non-swimmers suddenly immersed, under say 14C for casual swimmers, under 10 C for cold water swimmers, under 7C for extreme cold water). Habituation is trained in a little as five or six immersions. You start to be able to deal with the shock and the physical fight-or-flight reaction most people experience prior to cold when they know they will be exposed attenuates. Initial shock lasts about 30 seconds, with a longer 3 minute period for the next phase. Heart rate spikes and lowers. There are also stress hormonal reactions which disappear as you gain experience.</p>
<p>Acclimatisation is the longer term adaptation to cold by such people as open water swimmers (non-wetsuit). There is a normal psychological improvement in dealing with cold. Brown Adipose Tissue (brown fat) which generates heat unlike normal white fat, begins to spot grow on part s of the body such as torso and shoulders. </p>
<p>Physically, cold water shock also causes a number of responses</p>
<p>1.Normal blood pressure increases due to peripheral vaso-constriction in which blood flow to the extremities is shut off to protect core temperature. This will happen when just your feet enter the water. You feel a sudden need to urinate as a consequence. Your external skin surface quickly drops in temperature. (I've measured a skin temp of 18C on myself after a one hour swim in water of 14C, and felt utterly comfortable afterwards, but I'm trained to that). The temperature difference between your core at around 36C and the water at 14C is then much less. </p>
<p>It's important to note that heat loss still occurs even when you are feeling comfortable and will in water under say 18 C eventually result in hypothermia, for a person not swimming. (For a trained cold water marathon/Channel  swimmer, they will be able to swim and stay warm in 14C for 24 hour, determined mainly by their weight and training.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your heart rate rises sharply. This is one of the dangerous aspects, very slightly because of possible cardiac event, more because it can cause someone to aspirate water. As your heart rate settles, you start to feel more comfortable.</p>
</li>
<li>Depending on the water temperature &amp; your experience &amp; immersion time, you may experience great pain from the thermoceptors (temperature sensing) nerves in your skin. While heat sensing thermoceptors measure pain as temp increases until you burn, with cold thermoceptors &quot;shut off&quot;, ie you go numb. You have the most thermoceptors in your face, so people unused to cool water let alone cold, will have difficulty getting their face in the water. As your themoceptors numb, this also helps the adaptation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's one article I wrote, about <a href="http://loneswimmer.com/2012/11/13/cold-water-immersion-and-cold-shock-the-first-three-minutes/" target="_blank">the first three minutes of a cold water swim</a> that you may find useful.</p>
<p><strong>Obligatory edit</strong>: Gold? When all my family and friends say &quot;don't get him started on swimming&quot;? Thank you. Come for a swim with me, I haven't even mentioned my friendly cave swimming tours!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: I should cited earlier since this is /r/askscience, but didn't expect such interest. </p>
<p>Good references off the top of my head are:</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Sea Survival</strong>, <em>Mike Golden and Frank Tipton</em>, University of Portsmouth (survival research department). Out of print but the definitive work. There are a number of great papers from either or both of these.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of San Francisco Bay Cold-Water Swimmers</strong>; OSJM 2014; 8:1-10, <em>Thomas Nucton</em> MD  </p>
<p><strong>Extreme Cold Adaptation in Humans</strong>. A meta-analysis by <em>Tina Maakinen</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The same thing happens if your around a certain odor for any length of time, it eventually becomes unnoticable.   My grandmother never noticed how much her Virginia Slims habit made everything in her house smell like cigarette smoke.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's going on here is a phenomenon called &quot;neural adaptation.&quot;</p>
<p>Your nervous system is designed to filter out unnecessary information. One of the ways it does so is by gradually reducing the perceived intensity of constant, unchanging sensory inputs. This allows you to tune out background noises, ignore ever-present smells, ignore the feeling of your own clothes/hair touching you, etc. It's built into the way certain neurons talk to each other. Otherwise we'd constantly be overwhelmed with useless sensations.</p>
<p>Also happens with vision, e.g. the &quot;motion after-effect&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRHN0rnfME" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRHN0rnfME</a></p>
<p>Of course different senses are handled differently. You can't completely tune out chronic pain for example. With temperature, you might still feel cold after a while (especially if you stop producing heat from strenuous muscle exertion and just chill out in the water), but it won't feel as shockingly cold as when you first got in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
