		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the Sun's color spectrum differs from artificial lights, this is not the reason this is difficult. Any light made for film making combined with the correct white balance takes care of this 100%. Incandescent bulbs cover the entire visible spectrum, only in different ratios than the sun. With the correct gel or white balance, these ratios can be brought back to natural levels.</p>
<p>The issue here is <strong>distance</strong>. Light, like many other things, follows the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a></strong>, which means that the further a light source is, the less difference it makes if you move closer or further from it.</p>
<p>In other words, sunlight hitting your house is the same intensity than sunlight hitting your neighbor's house. Or sunlight hitting your face will be the same intensity as light hitting your hand. With an artificial light, the two won't receive the same amount of light, as the closeness of the light source means the light decays much faster.</p>
<p>We have come to associate one with natural, and the other with artificial light. Even without thinking, we can &quot;tell&quot; that light that decays over a short distance is artificial, while light that doesn't decay is natural.</p>
<p>An artificial light source can never be as far away as the Sun for obvious reasons, so another issue is that its shadows will never appear parallel.</p>
<p>The solution is to put your light source very far away, but then you need a light source that's very very strong to compensate. This makes this type of lighting expensive, heavy and time consuming to set up.</p>
<p>Another issue is diffusion. The Sun is surrounded by the sky, from our point of view. The sky is a giant surface very very far away. This means the Sun is accompanied by a fill light of a huge surface that is equally very far away, which is even more difficult to match with artificial light. There is no way we can build a surface anywhere near as large as the sky, and as far away.</p>
<p>To light a single face you may need two giant white sheets suspended with tripods and weights, and four 5 kilowatt lights to light it. Then you need to put all this as far as you can, and hope that enough light still hits your subject. If done right, you won't be able to tell it apart from natural light. Beyond a certain point, our minds won't know the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light coming from the sun is mostly due to thermal radiation, which is caused passively by hot materials. The hotter it is, the shorter the average wavelength of the light will be. The problem is that it is much hotter than a lightbulb filament could be, giving it a <a href="http://d2rormqr1qwzpz.cloudfront.net/photos/2013/04/16/47578-phys_img039.jpg" target="_blank">spectrum which can't be matched by incadescent lights.</a></p>
<p>However, it is possible to mimic the spectrum of the sunlight using LEDs or fluorescent lamps. They do that by first producing light of short wavelength, using dyes to turn that a bunch of other wavelengths. the spectrum of the sunlight. Those lights just are not very common, as most people prefer spectrums similar to what incadescent bulbs emit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your average light bulb makes no attempt to match natural lighting, but they make bulbs with every possible ratio of wavelength for hydroponic gardening, you can even simulate which season you prefer, as Autumn light tends to be ruddier than Spring light and plants that bloom in Autumn do best with a similar light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, the sun is effectively a point light source combined with Rayleigh scattering which gives us a light source with not just infinite depth but with the subtle effect on shadows as a result of the diffuse atmospheric scattering of light.</p>
<p>There is a company that produces a light source seeking to emulate this:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Natural light is very diffuse.  The direct light of the sun is a big component of that, but so is the reflection/refraction of that light from our atmosphere.  So reproducing 'various levels of light coming from everywhere' is hard to reproduce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
