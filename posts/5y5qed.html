<p>Did plants even grow in such areas at all, despite having the perfect temperature conditions?</p>

<p>Yes. There is plenty of fossil evidence that during the much warmer period of the Cretaceous (145 - 66 million years ago), the ice free land in both polar regions supported luxuriant forest ecosystems. There were conifer populations that existed, although the leaf falls and winter die-back of deciduous type trees greatly reduced energy and respiration demands, allowing for such communities to migrate north into the Arctic in the mid-Cretaceous. </p>
<p>Trees would have been generally spaced further apart than how we see in todays forests, in order to make the most of the sun when it was available. All populations would have been able to utilise the continuous months of sun during the summer/winter (depending on pole) to produce a large amount of the so called earlywood - cells with large, hollow interiors and thin walls that are good at conducting fluids - to meet the high fluid conduction demands of rapid growth. In contrast, the latewood of polar trees contains a layer of much smaller, thicker walled cells. </p>
<p>The earlywood-latewood cycle is seen in trees growing in seasonal areas today, but fossils from Cretaceous polar forests show a much more pronounced difference both in the size of the earlywood cells produced, and in the relative overall thickness of the different growth layers. The transition is almost instant and the latewood layers are extremely narrow, only being produced in the weeks of twilight either side of extended darkness - a period of complete dormancy with no new cells produced at all occurred during darkness.</p>
<p>Edit: light micrograph sections of growth cycles that indicate the kind of difference I mentioned:</p>
