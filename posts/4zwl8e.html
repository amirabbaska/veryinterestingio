		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to explain the paper in easier terms. </p>
<p>So, gravity and electromagnetism are used in the paper to help explain it. Objects with constant acceleration will telegraph their future position. An analogy made in the paper is to solve the same issue but for a charge in an em field. We know speed of light is not infinite, so the analogy extends to gravitational radiation. EM radiation is dipole though, so constant velocity telegraphs charge's future position. Gravitational radiation is quadrupole, so constant acceleration telegraphs the future position of the &quot;charged&quot; object.</p>
<p>Think of derivatives when you go from position to velocity to acceleration. Moving charge derivation tells you future position for its dipole. Moving mass derivation tells you the new speed as well as the new position due to its quadrupole nature. </p>
<p>This wouldn't work if the sun magically started gaining jerk. That is a level above acceleration and that information would be received at c which is the 8 minute figure. For stable orbits, you have to have com be current and not delayed by light. Newtonian mechanics can explain basic orbits without needing or mentioning information speed behaviors. </p>
<p>As the earth and sun orbit their com, the sun is telegraphing its future position and velocity. Some mass comes zipping by and disturbs the sun's orbit and earth wouldn't respond for 8 mins roughly. </p>
<p>We're absolutely sure that current position is what orbits use. If you google the paper, some people might have broken it down better than I. Don't take this analogy past its use an oversimplified example. I was loose with some terms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a minor in physics, specializing in Special Relativity, when in college, but that was a decade ago, so if I'm remembering this incorrectly, someone please please correct me.</p>
<p>I think this question, like so many others posted here, comes from a misunderstanding or simple lack of applying the concepts of &quot;frame of reference&quot;.</p>
<p>A &quot;Frame of Reference&quot; is a way of modeling a system where you consider one body to be at rest, and then figure out the relative speeds of everything else around it.  For an easy example, imagine you are running at 5 mph, and you throw a ball at 20 mph in front of you.  Let's consider 3 frames of reference for this scenario:</p>
<p>Earth at rest:  You -&gt; (5mph), Ball -&gt; (25mph)</p>
<p>You  at rest:  Earth &lt;- (5mph), Ball -&gt; (20mph)</p>
<p>Ball at rest:  Earth &lt;- (25mph), You &lt;- (20mph)</p>
<p>So what happens when we model objects in space?  Well first we need to pick a frame of reference.</p>
<p>If we choose the sun as our frame of reference, OP's question becomes trivial;  The sun isn't moving, so there's no issue with which position the sun is pulling towards.</p>
<p>But if we choose our galaxy as the frame of reference, then the sun is moving.... <strong>but so is the earth</strong>.  The earth is already plummeting through the galaxy at a rate that keeps it in sync with the sun.  The sun is not responsible for maintaining that relationship, because it already exists.  Momentum does most of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Relating this back to the actual question at hand, the trick is that gravitational waves, themselves <em>have momentum</em>.  So during the 8 minutes it takes for gravitational waves to reach earth from the sun, both the Sun itself, and the direction of it's gravitational force, have shifted due to momentum.  Barring any unexpected acceleration, the Sun and it's gravitational waves will have moved in sync with one another, and the signal we &quot;receive&quot;, points to the instantaneous position of the Sun, despite originating at the Sun's position 8 minutes prior.  </p>
<p><strong>The momentum of our solar system, as a whole, keeps all objects in sync, despite propagation times.</strong></p>
<p>This gets <em>far</em> more complicated if you apply acceleration to the Sun <strong>independently</strong> of it's surrounding bodies (i.e., the earth), but that's a pretty exceptional edge case that I don't think is the real question being asked here (is someone trying to add thrusters to the sun?).  </p>
<p>For traditional orbits, the real answer is to just choose a frame of reference where the math is easier (Sun at rest), or if in another frame of reference to rely heavily on momentum of the entire system, which allows you to cancel out any concerns about how long gravity takes to propogate (i.e., it doesn't matter).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PBS has a nice miniseries about general relativity. 5 episodes, each 10 min or so: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwhKZ3fd9JA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwhKZ3fd9JA</a></p>
<p>the TL;DR could be something like:</p>
<p>There is no gravity. Objects look like they are gravitating to each <del>over</del> other only in small systems, but they actually just move through curved space time at a &quot;constant speed&quot;.</p>
<p>So the &quot;now&quot; in your question is very tricky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
