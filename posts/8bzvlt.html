		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Grounding&quot; in electrical circuits just means a reference point, to which everything else can be connected.</p>
<p>For example, in a car, one side of the battery is connected to the car's body/chassis. This provides a convenient way to complete an electrical circuit. So, if you want to connect a headlight. You don't need to connect 2 wires - one taking current from the battery to the bulb, and one taking the return current from the bulb to the battery. Instead, you can just use 1 wire to take current from the battery to the bulb, and the return current can go via the car's chassis.</p>
<p>The same principle is used in marine craft, aircraft and spacecraft. The metal structure serves as a convenient method of connecting multiple things together to allow circuits to be completed. If two spacecraft need to dock, then the bodies can be electrically connected together to form a single &quot;ground&quot; zone covering both craft. Each craft retains its own electrical system, but the two systems share the same reference point. </p>
<p>For land based stationary applications (buildings), then the ground itself (which is electrically conductive) can be used as a convenient reference point, and as a failsafe method of carrying current in the case of an electrical fault. The ground itself isn't a very good electrical conductor, so it isn't usually used to carry current under normal conditions for energy efficiency reasons (but this is sometimes used in very rural areas, where a remote house or farm needs a long power line, but only a small amount of power, making it too expensive to run 2 wires on the power poles - in this case, you can just run a single wire, and use the ground as the return path).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronics aren't truly grounded on a spacecraft (or airplane, or car).</p>
<p>They're &quot;grounded&quot; to the frame of the vehicle or some other metal components, but not truly grounded.</p>
<p>All grounding is, is somewhere for excess electricity to go in case of a short circuit.  The best place is the actual ground, but in the case of a car, plane, or spaceship the frame is better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The docking collars are big chunks of conductive metal bolted securely to the spacecraft structure.  That seems like an ideal grounding interface.  Isolating the two ships subjects the crew that moves from ship to ship to static electric shocks.  That's going to make them unhappy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You just connect every component back to the spacecraft using some kind of conductive material so everything is at the same current level. If a component  is electrically isolated from everything else it will start to build up charge seperately from the spacecraft which will then have the potential to cause an electrical arc (due to the differences in charge) which can damage the electronics. </p>
<p>For two spacecrafts docking, it is possible i guess for them to be isolated from each other if every contact point between them is an insulator. But this is unlikely and the reality is that the two grounds (each spacecraft) will come together to form a new ground.</p>
