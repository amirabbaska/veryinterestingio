		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The button <em>is</em> the sensor. </p>
<p>See this paragraph from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touch ID is built into the home button, which is built of laser-cut[9] sapphire crystal, which does not scratch easily (scratching would prevent Touch ID from working).[10] It features a stainless steel detection ring to detect the user's finger without pressing it. The feature does not work without contact with this ring. There is no longer a rounded square icon in the home button, nor is it concave.
The sensor uses capacitive touch to detect the user's fingerprint.[10] The sensor has a thickness of 170 Âµm, with 500 pixels per inch resolution. The user's finger can be oriented in any direction and it will still be read.[2] Apple says it can read sub-epidermal skin layers,[11] and it will be easy to set up and will improve with every use.[9] The sensor passes a small current through one's finger to create a &quot;fingerprint map&quot; of the user's dermis. Up to 5 fingerprint maps can be stored in the Secure Enclave.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has fingerprints, the loops and swirls you can see looking at your finger, and everyone's loops and swirls are different. Those loops and swirls are caused by part of the skin being higher and lower than each other. The button on the phone has a sensor, a thing that takes measurements, inside that can sense fingerprints by using a tiny amount of electricity, similar to when you run across the carpet in socks, touch door knob, and there is a spark, you are acting like the phone and the door knob is like your finger. You have electricity and it moves from you to the door knob. On the button, you don't feel it because it is so tiny, but it can feel the loss of electricity, much like you do when you touch the door knob. Except the button on the phone can see more  see all of the points where there was and wasn't contact with your finger. On the button, the electricity is picked up by the raised part of your fingerprint, the lower part doesn't get it. Knowing where the electricity was picked up from and where it wasn't, let's the button see what your fingerprint looks like. It does this by using a bunch of tiny squares called a grid and recording which squares lost power and which squares didn't. The first time you do it, it the button learns what your finger looks like, and the phone remembers that. Then when you or someone else touchs the button, it takes what it sees and sends it to the phone that asks if what the button just saw is the same as what it remembers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
