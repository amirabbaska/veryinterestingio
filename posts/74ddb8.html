		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gasoline can &quot;freeze&quot; as in get hard when cooled enough, but it doesn't freeze as water does, by forming a crystalline structure. Gasoline is actually a mixture of substances with different properties, and freezing points.</p>
<p>Gasoline also has a <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/vehfire/fuels/flashpoint.html" target="_blank">flash point</a> of -45F, which is the temperature above which it will burn. So it will burn even very cold. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNjOaAIz_ZY" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video of somebody freezing gasoline and lighting it on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As noted by another poster, gasoline is very difficult to freeze. Diesel, on the other hand, turns in to gel at a not even really that cold -8C. The gel clogs up fuel filters until the fuel gets warm enough to mix the gel back into the liquid diesel. It can be reduced by mixing additives with fuel, or by simply letting your truck run 24/7 once the temperature starts getting really cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gasoline is a mixture of multiple molecules. It shouldn't have water in it (it may have very very very low amounts &lt; 10 ppm). The Octane is what you care about the most because that is what your engine uses for combustion. Its freezing point is at about -70F (-57C). But because your gasoline is a mixture of Octane, Heptane, Hexane, Nonane, and Decane (among other isomers of these items) you wouldn't see it freeze solid nor at that point. You would likely see freezing point depression from the non-octane components.</p>
<p>Ultra cold freezers go to -80C. These freezers use Helium to get that cold. You would need this type of freezer to freeze your gasoline because the next range of freezers just goes to -40C or -20C.</p>
<p>So IF you could get this freezer and IF you could freeze your gasoline, you could have it stored. Once it is thawed, you should theoretically be able to use it after you mix it up (if you can mix it in a manner that prevents it from evaporating).</p>
<p>Edit to add: because my comment about the helium freezer is generating controversy, this is what I'm talking about: <a href="http://www.stirlingultracold.com/news?article=60" target="_blank">http://www.stirlingultracold.com/news?article=60</a></p>
<p>So while there are other freezers that don't use this technology, my most recent personal experience (which includes putting petroleum products into this style of freezer) is with this tech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
