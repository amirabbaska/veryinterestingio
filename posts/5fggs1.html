Now you can't even take anything with peanuts in it to school for fear of harming someone. What caused the peanut allergy to explode like it did?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another hypothesis that comes from how the immune response is handled.  Your immune system has 5 different types of antibodies and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E" target="_blank">IgE</a> is the one that mediates most allergic responses.  It also happens to be responsible for attacking parasites as well.  The theory is that due to the prevalence of clean water in the western world, there's much less exposure to parasites, therefore, some people have a set of antibodies and their DNA that hasn't been stimulated yet so it eventually becomes hypersensitive to stuff like peanuts as it would essentially be the first immunological response for that antibody system.</p>
<p>EDIT: My bad, not simply due to clean water, but things LIKE clean water and general advances in medicine, waste disposal, sanitation and so forth.</p>
<p>It is, however, possible that those same people have a mutation in one of the various parts of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/hwvsd4a" target="_blank">antibody DNA</a> that causes their body to see those foreign objects as something with a similar enough structure that they can bind to it.  Regardless, if it's an initial response, it becomes a remembered response.  Being one of the first responses, of course, would make it so that future generations of your immune cells and structure remember that response and so it will persist throughout the person's lifetime as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not prevalent at all. Only around 1% of the population has a peanut allergy, but you are correct that they are more common now than they used to be. They do not really know why yet, but studies are indicating that it is because pregnant and nursing women avoided peanuts and did not give them to young children due to fears of peanut allergies and in so doing increased the number by not exposing their immune systems to them. </p>
<p>And few schools have a blanket ban on peanuts. Most have a variable ban that only goes into effect if there is a child known to have the allergy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lots of pseudoscience going on in the ELI5 here.</p>
<p>It's really simple:</p>
<p>1% of the population has had a nut allergy (which includes peanuts because the allergen is in both) for as long as they've been measuring it.  There's no data, whatsoever, to show an increase in the nut allergy.</p>
<p>Nor is this 1% those who have potentially fatal allergies.  This includes rashes, etc.</p>
<p>What has happened is two-fold.</p>
<p>1-  People have grown more considerate of food allergies in general.  If you had a deadly allergy you didn't eat out because no one gave a shit about crosscontamination.  As the food industry changed, concerns for crosscontamination increased, partially to avoid harming customers, and partially to avoid legal liability.</p>
<p>2-- Hypochondriacs.  As more awareness of a thing increases, self diagnosis increases.  Many people who claim a nut allergy do not test on an irritation test.  You see a similar phenomenon with gluten where 98% of people who claim a reaction to gluten react to gluten-free products if told it has gluten and don't react to products with gluten if they are told it doesn't (the other 2% have fucking celiac or some shit so don't fuck around and play the odds)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the not too distant past, severe allergies accompanied by anaphylactic shock were dealt with naturally, i.e. death. Due to advances in our understanding of the human body and modern medicine, those individuals that would have been culled naturally by severe allergies now live long and relatively healthy lives. These individuals live long enough to procreate and thus pass on different types of formally fatal allergies to their children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well meaning pediatricians told parents to delay feeding babies certain foods because they were known to cause severe allergic reactions in some people. Unfortunately, this made the problem worse because it turns out early exposure probably DECREASES the likelihood of developing those allergies. </p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics is now suggesting early introduction of peanuts (with possible medical supervision for babies at high risk of allergies), but it's too late for a generation of people who now have life threatening peanut allergies. </p>
