		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi!  I work on the geostationary satellites for NOAA.  Since you said you know very little about physics, here's a quick primer on orbits.</p>
<p>Orbits occur when an object is falling sideways fast enough to &quot;miss&quot; the Earth.  This might be hard to imagine, so imagine throwing a baseball.  The baseball goes up and down, but moves sideways as well.  The harder you throw it, the farther it goes.  If you threw it hard enough (in a vacuum), it would miss the Earth and keep falling forever.</p>
<p>Now, because gravity is exerted from the centers of mass (but the CoM of our satellite is relatively negligible), any orbit you travel in has to have the center of the Earth in its plane.  This means you can't have a &quot;halo&quot; orbit over the North pole, or off to the sides of the Earth.  In practical terms, we can say <em>any</em> orbit must cross the plane of the Equator at some point.</p>
<p>So, as this relates to your question.  A &quot;geostationary&quot; orbit is a geosynchonous orbit (one full orbit is one Earth day) that is in line with the equator.  Since this matches the Earth's rotation,, you're always over the same location.  Now imagine tilting the orbit so it was inclined.  You still orbit in one day, but you are moving North and South as you pass the Ascending Node and Descending Node (The points where you cross the equator).  Thus, your ground track is a figure-eight pattern, with the neck centered on the Equator.</p>
<p>So, to answer the second part of your question, no, you couldn't have a space elevator over NYC.  That would be in an orbit that doesn't cross the equator, which is not possible.  Geostationary satellites (and, by extension, space elevators) are only possible at near-zero latitude.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any other questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geostationary orbits can only occur along the equator.  Any orbit occurs on a two dimensional plane that passes through the center of mass for the object it is orbiting.  For a satellite orbiting earth anywhere north or south of the equator the position directly below the satellite would have to move north and south with the satellites orbit, not geostationary.  This also means that a space elevator could only work at the equator but there is a simpler reason that is easier to visualize.  In theory, a space elevator would use centrifugal force to cancel out the force of gravity trying to pull the structure down. Anywhere outside of the equator the centrifugal force would not be in line with gravity causing a sideways force on the elevator. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a side note to the answers given I would like to point out some other interesting orbits. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_orbit" target="_blank">Tundra orbits</a> in particular are cool because you can get a similar effect to a geostationary orbit but with a higher apogee. They make a skewed figure 8 shape as the Earth rotates under it because of their high inclination. Sirius radio used these kind of orbits, By having three satellites in this kind of orbit trading places they hade a much higher apogee than geostationary orbits, allowing for a clearer signal. A variation of the Tundra orbit is the Molniya orbit. So even though it would not be possible to put a space elevator above NYC, you could put a constellation with an apogee right above it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not by just using gravity. This has been discussed extensively in the other answers.</p>
<p>However, if you consider additional forces, then yes. These forces can either be natural (solar radiation pressure) or artificial (thrust). In the first case, we could use solar sails; in the second case, an electric thruster (or even a combination of the two). Either way, there is another force that adds up to gravity, therefore moving the position of the equilibrium point away from the classical &quot;geostationary&quot; (=equatorial, ~36,000 km altitude). The new equilibrium point can be displaced either radially (inwards or outwards) or out-of-plane (north or south).</p>
