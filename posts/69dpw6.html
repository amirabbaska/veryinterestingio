		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're inbetween the plates at the centre, and the plates are much wider than their distance, they are well approximated by infinite parallel plates and so the field lines are straight.</p>
<p>If you instead zoom out and look at the whole thing from a distance, they look like an electric dipole, whose field lines look like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/VFPt_dipole_point.svg/250px-VFPt_dipole_point.svg.png" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>These are both approximations to finite parallel plates that hold in two opposite limits. Inbetween, the field lines will interpolate. So at the middle they look mostly straight, as you move out they start bulgin out and very far away they get the shape of dipole field lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just finished up engineering physics at college.. the field lines are an average vector of the sum of the forces acting on a particle.  When the proton reaches the top it wants to get as far away from it's positive charged plate (like charges repel) as possible.  this initially sends the particle on the path of least resistance, or straight up (or down depending on where you're looking) from the charged plate.  However shortly after the intensity of the pull from the negative plate (opposites attract) grows on average as it gets further from the positive plate and gets pulled closer to the negative plate.  It still has enough initial velocity to break this intensity, but the plate bends the proton in the x-direction slightly, which subtracts from the initially strong y-direction forces.  Eventually you see the arrow seemingly perpendicular with the plates again because the momentum picks up and the intensity of the pull from the negative plate pulls on the proton at that point the same amount the positive plate pushes it.  </p>
<p>Finally the proton travels further slightly and now the pull of the negative plate is stronger than the positive plate and this curves it back to the negative plate.</p>
<p>Reminder that field lines are not direct paths but averages of the cross product of the vectors of velocity and the magnetic field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that electric field lines represent a vector field and not a path, at those points on the edge of the plates the combination of all the forces exerted by the plate make a curved shape. Look at the diagram with that in mind and it should be clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EE wth electromagnetic expertice here. It helps to remember that like charges repel, and parallel currents in the same direction repel. The field shape is a combination of the opposite charges at the poles attracting and the like parts of the innards of the field repelling. Also, field lines aren't really lines, it is a smooth linear field. Lines make it easier to visualize, and the reason that iron filings make lines is that they form little induced magnetic domains in the presence of a bigger field and tend to attract each other on the ends and repel each other in the middles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you imagine every single positive point &quot;giving out&quot; field lines radially, and negative point &quot;receiving&quot; the field lines. The plate is just a line of many point charges lined up together. &quot;Summing&quot; the field lines across the gap between the two plates results in an even field distribution - we represent that using straight lines instead. The &quot;end effect&quot; on the other hand, doesn't have more charges to &quot;balance&quot; them out, so they curve</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
