		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some here are promoting the myth that body hair removal is a 20th century thing. It's not. Its been a thing for 1000s of years.</p>
<p>Household manuals from the victorian era going back to the 1200s advise of sugaring or waxing techniques, as well as depilitory creams. Several military manuals recommend it to reduce body lice spread in men. They may not have done it as often, but its a part of European culture </p>
<p>Elsewhere...well, predynastic Egyptians were shaving all their hair 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>Its not new, and men not doing it is largely a result of a more sedentary life and lower numbers in the military.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women shaving their legs came about during World War II when nylon was rationed. Before that women would wear nylon stockings. Razor companies also had the agenda of marketing their product to women since men were off fighting, Thus women were seeking the nylon look (smooth leg) and achieving it by using the razors and shaving cream that the companies were specifically marketing to them with the men gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Estrogen is responsible for secondary sexual characteristics in women, one of those being less/lighter body hair. Having less body hair frequently (but not always) means more estrogen, and I guess more reproductive fitness (from a sexual selection standpoint). Dunno when/why shaving started, but there's some basis in biology for why women do it and not men.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm surprised about the down-voting, i'm honestly trying to be helpful!</p>
<p>Maybe some elaboration: reproductive fitness in this case means the ability to ovulate, and has nothing to do with many other traits, such as whether you are beautiful, smart, or a good person, that are desirable. Estrogen spikes are what lead to ovulation and play one role in reproductive fitness. No estrogen, no ovulation, and no babies, that's it. </p>
<p>LPT: If you want lighter body hair, try an estrogen based birth control pill (in combo with a non-androgenic progesterone), such as Safyral. It can cut down the amount you need to shave every week, but it takes a month or two to have this effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
