		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, male and female embryos start out with the same parts and develop into their respective sex organs later in development. The sexes are indistinguishable until about 9 weeks of development in the womb. </p>
<p>You're partially right in the connection between the scrotum and the female genitalia: the tissue (labioscrotal swellings), that develops into the scrotum, or &quot;ballsac&quot;, in a male fetus is the same tissue that develops into the outer labia of a female fetus. At a certain point in development hormones, called &quot;androgens&quot; stimulate the development of male or female sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>As the fetus develops, the glans will either become the head of the penis (in males), or the clitoris (in females), and the labioscrotal swellings will either become the outer labia (or lips) of the vulva (the outside part of the female genitalia) or they will fuse together to become the scrotum.</p>
<p>In certain cases, an infant will be born with genitalia that is ambiguous. For example: an enlarged clitoris and testicles, or a vaginal opening and a penis. People born with these characteristics are know as intersex. </p>

It's formed during the development of the genitals, called the <a href="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter23-pregnancygrowthanddevelopment-110728075954-phpapp02/95/chapter-23-pregnancy-growth-and-development-31-728.jpg?cb=1311840178" target="_blank">Urogenital Folds</a> and is the resulting line you see.</p>

NSFW at all so don't open it if you're at a place you shouldn't be opening such things.</p>
<p>Note: I am not a doctor or in anyway related to the medical field, so please don't ask me any questions regarding this. I only looked it up and found the answers online. If there is a doctor in the house, or someone far more qualified to speak on human body development, then please step forward. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saying it &quot;started out as a vagina&quot; is an overstatement, but it's grounded in truth.</p>
<p>When we're forming in the womb, we start with a shallow slit between our legs. For women, that slit deepens while in men it stitches together.</p>
<p>Calling it a vagina at that stage in development isn't really accurate; a vagina is more than just a gap in skin, it's a structurally complex organ with a dozen different unique cells and its own intricate biology. The prenatal gap superficially, however, <em>is</em> closer in appearance to a vulva than to testicles, hence the common narrative that we all start as women. </p>
<p>EDIT: To add what many other helpful users are posting, we do &quot;default&quot; to female; the activation of the Y-Chromosome causes a release of testosterone which promotes the growth of male sex characteristics. Even if a Y-chromosome is present, if testosterone fails to release then the fetus will progress and develop as basically female. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
