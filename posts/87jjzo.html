		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr A contemporary theory is that our representations of objects (and space?) are to a certain extent mirror-symmetry invariant. Facing direction for most objects is not a meaningful feature. If you walk around an object (rotate it 180 degrees), which side is the left and which is the right switches. You can't do that with up-down. It is thought that we break this to a certain extent when we become literate in a language that has mirror-reversed letters like &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; because this is a rare case where facing direction of an object changes its identity.</p>
<p>Note: what follows is essentially a summary of <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/3/28/htm" target="_blank">Erlikhman et al. (2017)</a> which is a review of all of these ideas (mostly in the context of reading). </p>
<p>This has been used as an explanation for mirror-reversal errors in children -- mistaking &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; or &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; for example. It used to be thought that these were indications of dyslexia or some other dysfunction, but it turns out that these are common errors (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1127327?casa_token=ysNQzmaWyD0AAAAA:kPJo8c3BTGbPXhoH9LjZ8cNPj-qd3urVoqXTHHidBjbDuaXNfa3KMcn01Hl1DhHY536nO4BE-XcxMuD7bvCM7tu9Puk7-8l5LZehr2ez1MZPeIOFUfMHGA&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">Cairns &amp; Steward 1970</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201416300119" target="_blank">Fischer &amp; Koch 2016</a>). Interestingly, children make such reversals not just for mirrored letters, but also ones which do not have a mirrored counterpart like 'a', suggesting that this may be a more general effect. These kinds of reversals are more common than up-down reversals. Reversals occur not just for letters, but also for letter-like symbols, objects, and not only in identifying and reproducing from memory (i.e. writing), but also when asked to perform a matching task where a letter is visible and a child is asked to select another one that looks like it and they pick the mirrored version (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1971.tb02059.x" target="_blank">Frith 1971</a>; <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Cognition_1978.pdf" target="_blank">Bornstein, Gross, &amp; Wolf 1978</a> &lt;- pdf!)). That is, they can tell that two picture are not identical, but they don't understand that they are &quot;different&quot;. There is some amount of rotational / mirror invariance-built in, and not just for letters, but also for objects (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506285.2011.610764" target="_blank">Gregory, Landau &amp; McCloskey 2011</a>). </p>
<p>It has been argued that mirror-reversal errors in children are <em>acquired</em> as a function of learning language -- for most objects, when you walk around them, you are seeing the mirror-reverse version, they are the same! For letters, a child has to learn that a mirror-revered version of &quot;b&quot; has a different name: &quot;dee&quot;. Most objects do not have a &quot;facing direction&quot; and adults have much difficulty in remembering the facing direction of objects (e.g. the direction Lincoln faces on a penny or the direction the Apple logo faces) and scenes (e.g. if I show you a picture and then later a mirror-reversed version, you will have a hard time telling whether it is reversed or not (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03337426" target="_blank">Standing, Conezio, &amp; Haber 1970</a>). Learning to read focuses on facing-direction as an important object feature for discrimination. As children learn to read, the number of mirror-reversal errors decreases. </p>
<p>One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for this is the study of illiterate individuals who learn to read late in life and whose languages have mirror-reversed letters. Across a variety of languages, illiterates have a harder time discriminating mirror-reversed abstract line drawings than literates (<a href="http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/wll.1.2.02dan" target="_blank">Danziger &amp; Pederson 1998</a>). The one exception is Tamil-speakers -- in Tamil, there are no letters that are enantiomporphs (mirror-reversed), and those individuals, even though literate, have the same difficulty in discriminating mirror-reversed letters as illiterates (<a href="http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/wll.6.1.04ped" target="_blank">Pederson 2003</a>). However, being bilingual in Tamil and another language that uses the Latin alphabet makes the effect go away (i.e. they become sensitive to facing-direction). For a more comprehensive look at this, see <a href="http://www.unicog.org/publications/2013-20594-001.pdf" target="_blank">Pegado et al. (2014)</a> (&lt;- pdf!) where they show that speeded matching / recognition for mirror-reversed letter-like strings is the same for illiterates but is slower for ex-illiterates. They argue that learning a language where the left-right reversal is important for object (letter) identification, break mirror symmetry invariance. Poor readers also make more mirror-reversal letters for non-objects. Stan Dehaene has published a number of papers in the last decade pushing this theory (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627307007593" target="_blank">Dehaene &amp; Cohen 2007</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909010039" target="_blank">Dehaene et al. 2010a</a>; <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6009/1359" target="_blank">Dehaene et al. 2010b</a> ; and see especially <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3924" target="_blank">Dehaene et al. 2015</a>). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's simply because of our bilateral symmetry. For example, if you put a bag on one hand, you won't have any trouble telling it apart from your other hand. Replace the terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; hands with &quot;normal hand&quot; and &quot;bag hand&quot;, and you won't get them confused even when looking in a mirror.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the conversation, we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system" target="_blank">vestibular senses</a>, which give us our sense of balance, where our body parts are, etc.. In particular, we have fluid sacs in our inner ear which detect motion and which use gravity to tell up from down. In some environments, such as underwater, we lose the normal gravitational cues that tell us up from down and can get disoriented.</p>
<p>This can also occur if you're very dizzy, which is what happens when the fluid in your ears says you're moving but the feedback from the rest of your body says you aren't. In these situations it's hard to orient yourself properly at all, and if you fall over it's because you're having difficulty telling up from down (but gravity always knows).</p>
<p>So, I guess a short answer is, we generally have an absolute reference for up and down, whereas left and right are relative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
