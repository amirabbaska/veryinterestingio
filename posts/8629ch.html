		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a colleague who received a knighthood “for services to disabled children.” The privileges and advantages were huge and wonderful - and directed entirely to the organisations that he worked and volunteered for. </p>
<p>First, the occasion itself was in the national news, and this brought attention to so many good causes and charities. Then, afterwards, local news came and visited these organisations to take his photograph and report on his story. </p>
<p>Then local donors and benefactors started to come forward and offer gifts; volunteers asked for opportunities to help; other organisations invited our client children to visit, enjoy experiences and opportunities they previously never had. </p>
<p>That knighthood opened doors, created goodwill and opportunities, and gave us resources we never had before. I’ve never experienced any other single event that has created so many positive results. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't get to joust or wear armor, but you do pick up a few unusual garments. Knights and Dames Grand Cross get to wear special gear to formal events like coronations. This getup includes a pink-with-gray-edges satin mantle and a collar of six gold medallions.</p>
<p>All members of the Order are allowed to wear the group's badge. The badge is basically a cross hanging from a pink ribbon with gray edges, although various ranks wear their badges in unique ways. Members and Officers simply wear their badges like military medals pinned to their chests, while higher-ups wear theirs on sashes or around their necks.</p>
<p>Other benefits include getting a spot in the British order of precedence, the arcane system that develops the hierarchy of ceremonial importance for things like state dinners. Furthermore, knights win their wives the right to be called &quot;Lady,&quot; and Knights and Dames Grand Cross can modify their coats of arms to reflect the honor.</p>
