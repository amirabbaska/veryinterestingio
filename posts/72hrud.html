		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some are blood vessels near the skin (like a capillary hemangioma that grows for several months and then starts to recede). </p>
<p>Some are just moles, but it makes people feel better to call them birthmarks. </p>
<p>Some are basically large freckles that don't mean anything unless you have several of them over a certain size (for example in neurofibromatosis). </p>
<p>Some, like the &quot;Mongolian spot&quot; near the butt areas of some babies, show up in a ton of babies and slowly fade with age like the &quot;stork bite&quot; redness behind the neck or the &quot;angel's kiss&quot; between the eyes/forehead. </p>
<p>Why do people have all of these benign marks? In the absence of a more sinister condition... just plain ol' unexplained luck or genetics (Mongolian spots more in Asians for example). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can talk specifically about one type of birthmark - &quot;strawberry birthmarks&quot; aka infantile haemangiomas.</p>
<p>There are two main theories for why these happen, and why they're so prevalent.</p>
<p>One theory is that they're due to cells shed from the placenta that kind of settle on the developing foetus.  (Barnes et al 2005)  There's genomic analysis done that shows that the tissue from an infantile haemangioma is basically identical to placental tissue.  That Barnes et al paper puts it as, &quot;the view of placenta as ‘tumor’ and hemangioma as its ‘metastasis.’&quot;  There's also an association between transcervical chorionic villus sampling, placenta praevia, premature birth and preeclampsia, which all cause cells to be shed from the placenta.</p>
<p>And the other theory is a mutation in an individual endothelial (blood vessel wall) cell, which causes it to replicate rapidly in a clonal (all the same, rather than differentiating to perform different roles) manner - basically a tumour.  Science has no idea why this might originally happen - just the luck of the DNA-mutation lottery, probably - but why's it so prevalent, and why only in babies, and why do they go away?  Possibly associated with higher renin levels during early infancy, which drop as a child gets older.  There are also higher renin levels in the groups in which we see the highest incidence of infantile haemangiomas (female babies, Caucasian babies, and premature babies).  (Ritter et al 2007)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since I've started my job eye screening I've come across something called a naevus which is a birthmark inside the eye.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that there is a distinct green/brown tinge to the retina of someone from Asia (middle east, far east and Indian regions) however white peoples retinas are typically a red colour, when a white person has a naevus its the same colour as the retina of an Asian person.</p>
<p>Very interesting that birthmarks can be in places other than the skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A birthmark is an unscientific word to describe any dermatological benign growth or spot that is usually unchanged from birth, though even the from birth and unchanged are loosely used by the public. You won’t find an answer to this question because basically anything can be considered a “birth mark” so there are potentially hundreds or thousands of different types and subtypes of lesions that the public would call a “birthmark” all with different causes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
