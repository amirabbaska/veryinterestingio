Would a meltdown be much more survivable if it was under 20 feet of water? Oh what about underground reactors?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the response so far :) But another issue is why not deep under ground such as in deep cave systems where a space has been created or in mountain where  it can provide additional shielding? Basically why build it where they are built right now?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Advanced nuclear reactor designer here. Building nuclear power plants at sea is a <em>very</em> interesting idea, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can construct them in a shipyard, which is a controlled, repeatable environment with expert full-time employees who live nearby (not recently-trained temp workers living in a camp). Effectively, it's an assembly line for huge power plants. This could conceivably bring construction costs and timelines down. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're intimately coupled to a infinite heat sink (the water). Turning nuclear chain reactions off is easy (just put the control rods in), but they still produce afterheat due to fission product decay and this must be cooled to prevent the release of radiation out of the fuel pins/containment into the environment (e.g. to prevent meltdown). If you're sitting in the ocean, you can basically just open a valve and passively flood the heat transfer interfaces, keeping things cool without any external power. Thus, you'd be extremely safe. </p>
</li>
<li>You're seismically decoupled from the ground, so you don't have to worry about earthquakes. &quot;Sure,&quot; you might be thinking, &quot;but what about tsunamis?&quot; No problem. Operate a few km offshore where the water is deep and you won't even notice tsunamis going by (they have super-long wavelengths in deep water). Boom. </li>
</ol>
<p>You DO have to worry about some new hazards, like ship collisions and huge storms. But shipbuilding is at a point these days that you can keep operating a major facility like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_FLNG" target="_blank"><em>Prelude</em></a> through a Category 5 cyclone, which is truly awesome. And you have issues like operation and maintenance will be more expensive. But you could just sail home to your shipyard-base to reload and do maintenance, which could actually be pretty slick. </p>
<p>You also worry about the fact that at sea, a leak somewhere is a leak everywhere, since the sea disperses things well. So even though it'd be much less likely to have a radioactive release, it would be a very big deal. This is a key PR challenge for floating nuclear. (Realistically, the retention and dilution of the radionuclides would be very good in the sea, but everyone can see that this technical fallback is completely societally unacceptable)</p>
<p>Lots of people are thinking about this. MIT is <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2014/floating-nuclear-plants-could-ride-out-tsunamis-0416" target="_blank">working on a floater</a>. Russia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademik_Lomonosov" target="_blank">a one under construction</a> to provide power to very remote villages. China is <a href="http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2015/10/china-to-develop-floating-nuclear-power-plant.html" target="_blank">working on one</a>. In the early 1970s, a company was formed called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_Power_Systems" target="_blank">Offshore Power Systems</a> that was going to build two huge nukes on barges off the New Jersey coast. It was cancelled after the oil crisis when the main demand (oil refineries along the coast) fell dramatically. </p>
<p>Personally, I think floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs) are one of humanity's best options for transitioning away from fossil fuels rapidly, responsibly, and economically. </p>
<p>Anyway, great question!</p>
<p>(Also, of course, there are many naval reactors propelling ships and submarines all over, so the military definitely does build reactors on and in water. )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meltdowns are not all that common due to the stringent safety precautions nuclear power plants have. It takes wilful disabling of all safety measures or actual earthquakes to cause any major leak. </p>
<p>These safety measures would be more difficult to ensure if everything was under water. It'd also be more difficult to make and harder to maintain. </p>
<p>Building it underwater wouldn't stop a leak from spreading and the explosion like Chernobyl was too powerful for 20ft of water to make a difference.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear reactors do not 'radiate' much radiation at all, so that is not really an issue, they create radioactive products but that is a separate issue. The reactors themselves are not a problem.</p>
<p>If fact at the ANSTO research reactor in Australia there is <strong>less</strong> radiation inside the reactor room than is naturally occurring standing outside of the building exposed to space.</p>
<p>Also sailors on nuclear sub can actually experience less radiation from the reactor as they would normally receive if they were living in a house for example. (or on a surface ship). </p>
<p>Plus a reactor or a nuclear sub is an underwater nuclear reactor.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Canadian CANDU heavy water reactors operate under a pool of heavy water. The heavy water both shields the reactor and is a moderator, so if it leaks, the reaction slows down instead of speeding up.</p>
<p>You wouldn't necessarily want to put the whole building under water because you want to contain anything that might leak out, and you want to be able to access the reactor for maintenance and repairs. </p>
<p>With recent advances in robotics and control systems it might be interesting to look at this again, but the CANDU designs have been operating safely around the world since the 70s. The only they aren't so great at is enriching fuel for weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A French company, DCNS, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/frances-latest-green-idea-underwater-nuclear-reactors/" target="_blank">is developing an underwater nuclear reactor</a>. </p>
<p>From the linked article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Company executives say that the reactor's design coupled with the concept of storing it 300 feet below the sea should ease some of the safety qualms people have with nuclear power plants. Scheduled for installation in 2016, the reactor will be able to withstand natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods, according to CEO Patrick Boissier's interview with the online publication Platt. He also mentions that it will be far less vulnerable to terrorist attacks than a land-based nuclear reactor, with the added benefit of the ocean as a built-in coolant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also plans for small reactors which could be buried underground, with similar expected advantages. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
