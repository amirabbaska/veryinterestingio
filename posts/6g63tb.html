		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a 27 year old male. Great job, great girlfriend and some really close friends. </p>
<p>I began to notice I stuttered a lot when I was around 9-10. I was told it'd go away by adulthood but to this day, it shows up when I'm really excited, happy or in any positive mood. It's the strangest thing because my brain knows what I want to say but my mouth won't let it come out. Like the words are trapped in some sort of purgatory. </p>
<p>It's not so bad where people notice ALL the time but occasionally I'll get the &quot;poke fun&quot; at jist.</p>
<p>What's actually happening in my brain that is causing this? I've read way too many articles with various opinions to be sure so I thought I'd ask here. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have social anxiety but i would describe stuttering(at least for me) as paralel to social anxiety.
Even while little when the stuttering was the worst, i would never stutter if i was alone or in the company or certain people. But in social settings or with certain people like my father,teacher,girls, friends i was trying to impress or even weird situations like answering the phone was nightmare for me.  </p>
<p>What helped me is what i see being recommended against social anxiety, number one being stop making it the defining thing in your life. People were already making fun of me so why care so much if i stutter. And the funny thing was the less i cared the less i stuttered.<br />
By college i even took a short job in phone support and within 1 week even answering phones that was my greatest fear was resolved.</p>
<p>i'm 30+ and i very rarely stutter mostly when i'm super eager to share something like when getting to the punchline of a good joke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any definitive answers for you. But I have the same condition. Quite severe as a young child gradually learnt to deal with it and improve but it has never gone away. Most people wouldn't notice it these days but I notice it whenever I speak. It's just a lot of effort to speak for me. Constantly practising the words in my head and often pausing my speech or substituting words to avoid a stutter.</p>
<p>I've read several explanation and like you am not completely certain. One is that it is an involuntary action caused by a disconnect or inefficient in pathways within the brain. Another explanation was that it was actually an involuntary spasm of the vocal cords.</p>
<p>Personally I think it's likely there are a variety of causes because not everyone stutters the same. Some people repeat syllables, some people, get stuck and can't speak and for others it almost seems like an involuntary tick similar to tourette's syndrome.</p>
<p>Sorry I don't have any definitive info. However there are lots of people who experience it to one degree or another and there are ways to improve it. For me improvement has come from speech therapy, learning to relax, breath slowly and rehearse in my head. Even just accepting that it going to happen and owning it as a part of me has somehow helped. It was important to realise that I notice it a lot more then others do when I'm conversing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because this is ELI5 I'll try to keep it ELI5-style. You basically stutter because your brain is too far ahead of your mouth. That's all. I stuttered when I was really young and it was because I wanted to tell everyone so much and this much and this and this and my mouth just couldn't keep up.</p>
<p>My best friend's mom then gave me a very good word of advice: &quot;think before you speak&quot;. This means that you should literally visualise yourself (i.e. mouth movements) and hear yourself speak before you actually speak so your brain is in sync with your mouth. </p>
<p>Another reason why some people study is social anxiety, they stutter because they think that people will judge which makes them even more anxious which increases stuttering, it's a viscious cycle. Talk a bit slower, people will wait, no biggie. Besides, talking slowly and surely with a firm tone shows confidence. </p>
<p>Think before you speak.</p>
<p>Speak slower. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that there are different reasons, but I've thought about it quite a bit since my childhood (a long while ago)</p>
<p>I use the way that I write a paper or even this response.  While I've been writing it, I've moved up and down the page typing a sentence or fixing another then coming back to my other line.  Although it was always just minor, I can only describe at the stutter in my case (and my daughter's) it seems to be that our mouths can't move as fast as our thoughts and we have to &quot;refind&quot; our place.  I know that everyone thinks faster than their mouths, but we will already be on another topic or thought about a thought and forget where we are in the original conversation.<br />
solution: I stop, create the entire sentence, thought, whatever in my head, THEN start talking.  My stuttering has almost completely stopped.  My daughter (tween), my wife and I will tell her, &quot;stop, figure out what you want to say, THEN tell us&quot; and we will wait the second or two it takes her and she speaks without stuttering.  I can only assume that it works as like a speed bump or something. </p>
<p>For cyan1618 where native tongue there's a stutter, but not when using 2nd language, I believe that although one begins to think in the 2nd language after awhile, there is still a level of thinking in native and thus a focus that's needed and it's enough to remove the stutter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
