I don't think Nietzsche was outright saying that there is no God but that if you consider the possibility of no god, that means whatever basis you had for &quot;good&quot; is now gone. </p>
<p>What can happen is since there is no more basis for right or wrong, people will lose hope and find life meaningless and futile and become nihilists. Or if you're a strong enough individual, you create your own set of values and live your life on your terms and become an &quot;uberman&quot; or ubermensch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nietzsche's &quot;Ubermensch&quot; is the goal that society should set for itself in the process of rejecting the morality of religion, particularly the Christian/Catholic Church. Nietzsche saw the Church's influence and power over society as the sick man's victory over the healthy man, as a real perversion, etc. In short, he wasn't a fan.</p>
<p>&quot;God is dead&quot; is simply Nietzsche's way of saying that we do not have to rely on God to give meaning to life. And in effort to stave off nihilism, Nietzsche argues for the need of the &quot;Ubermensch&quot;. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ubermensch&quot; creates new values that must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the Ãœbermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch" target="_blank">Source</a>. So rather than God giving us meaning to life, <em>we</em> give ourselves that meaning.</p>
<p>Nietzsche kind of gets a bad rep, in some instances, as being this incredibly nihilistic person but in fact I think he was looking for a way to usurp the power of religion whilst also resisting nihilism and the concept of the Ubermensch was his attempt at doing so. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other half of this, which Cyclone_1 touched on, was Nietzche's &quot;Genealogy of Morals.&quot;  In ancient times, there was nothing wrong with the strong being strong.  If a person was wealthy and powerful, then it was only natural that they would be the leaders.  They were seen as being inherently better people or (often) blessed by the Gods.  This is what Nietzche calls &quot;Master Morality.&quot;</p>
<p>When Christianity came along, it inverted the moral system.  Christianity's adherents knew they were not powerful enough to overthrow the existing regimes, but they could subvert it.  This is why Christ promises that &quot;the meek shall inherit the Earth,&quot; among other things.  Now to be rich and powerful was shameful, while humility and poverty were considered virtuous.  This is what Nietzche calls &quot;Slave Morality.&quot;  Not in the sense of literal slavery, perhaps, but rather a system of morality designed to appeal to the weak, the poor, and the underclass of society.  </p>
<p>So which system of morality is better?  Nietzche says, &quot;Neither.&quot;  It is better to invent your own system of morality without caring what other people think.  Nietzche's <em>Ubermensch</em> is a person who is completely liberated and lives exactly as they please without being controlled by other people's expectations. </p>
<p>Nietzche gets a bad rap, which is not entirely deserved.  He paints Christianity as being a manipulative ideology that caters to the weakest minds, and I'm not sure he's wrong on that point.  The idea of the Ubermensch also got caught up in Nazi Germany.  So now when people hear the word, they assume you are talking about Hitler's idealized Aryan race.  This is not at all what Nietzche was talking about.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the meaning of life, where Nietzsche is considered one of the more prominent naturalists, he has two main premises.</p>
<p>Premise 1: In order for a persons life to have meaning, they must manifest the Will to Power. The will to power in this instance being overcoming limitations and self-improvement.</p>
<p>Premise 2: A person can manifest the will to power, therefore</p>
<p>Conclusion: A persons life can have meaning, so long as they manifest the will to power.</p>
<p>Nietzsche came up with the concept of the Ubermensch, which is a collection of people who live every day of their lives manifesting the will to power. In his book &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathrustra&quot;, a tightrope walker competed with another more skilled opponent, fell off of the rope and died. The main character in the book, known as Zoroaster, believed that the tightrope walker was one of the Ubermensch, as he lived every day improving himself, and facing constantly overcoming adversity. Even if he isn't the most talented, and even if he eventually is beaten by someone else better than him at his task, his life has had meaning.</p>
<p>For instance, a little old woman can be a member of the Ubermensch, if instead of wallowing in bed all day she pushes herself to walk, even if it's the most difficult thing in the world for her to do. Even if she can never do it with skill or finesse, so long as she tries her hardest to accomplish that goal, her life will have meaning so long as she does this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nietzsche's thinking focused on investigating <em>values</em>. Whenever we think about ethics, try to live a good life, or condemn others for being assholes, we are implicitly assuming some values. But what does it mean to value something? Why do we tend to share values? What is the historical source of those values? It turns out that people in different societies and at different times have different values, and so our values must have historical sources. As an example, we tend to think that cannibalism is terrible, but in some societies it is Ok. In order to understand our society and ourselves we must look towards the sources of our values. Of course, once you realize that our values have a historical source, then you realize that at some point someone made them up. Nietzsche points to several individuals who were sources of our values, such as Socrates and Jesus, as well as to various historical and political factors that contributed to the origin and development of various values systems.</p>
<p>One of the most confusing aspects of Nietzsche is this idea that our value systems are made up. It's confusing because it looks like Nietzsche is criticizing our value system by saying this, but he's not. After all, <em>all</em> value systems, everywhere, were made up at one point, so it's not like our value system is thereby worse than any other. More to the point, the thing that Nietzsche really <em>likes</em> is the activity of making up value systems. That's the way that he thinks that we impose ourselves upon the world (Will to Power). Nietzsche wants us to keep making up new value systems, not to just be stuck with the ones we are given. The &quot;ubermensch&quot; is the person who whom Nietzsche calls on to make up new value systems. The quote that &quot;God is dead&quot; is an acknowledgement that our value systems are already changing and we no longer value God in the way that people used to. As u/Cyclone_1 already noted, it might also indicate Nietzsche's liking for the creation of new value systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
