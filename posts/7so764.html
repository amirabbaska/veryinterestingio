		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jungle is more of a literary term than a scientific one.  When talking about wooded biomes, most ecologists use a combination of climatic and vegetative descriptors.  Depending on the classification system, there are tropical rainforests (which you might think of as jungle), temperate rainforests, deciduous forests, boreal forests, mangrove forests, and probably a few other minor ones.  The wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome" target="_blank">Biome</a> actually has a really good overview of the different classification systems.  So a forest would be any wooded area, and a tropical rainforest would be a forest that grows in the tropics, has lots of precipitation, and dense vegetation.  I suppose that the reason we don't use jungle so much anymore is because it doesn't differentiate well between different tropical forests, and it has different connotations such as &quot;uncivilized&quot; or just &quot;dense vegetation.&quot;  Tropical rainforest is more precise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could argue that jungle is just a regional colloquialism for forest without scientific distinction. Comes from Sanskrit basically for uncultivated land so became popular word for forest in the Indian subcontinent, where forests tend to be tropical and wet. Use of the word became more prevalent globally in the 17th century with popularization of colonial authors like Kipling and Forster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, Jungle implies tropical with a high level of rain.  This puts jungle and &quot;tropical rain forest&quot; as about the same.  Jungle also implies a dense canopy and a large amount of tree dwelling life.  My area, with 60 plus inches of rain a year can be described as a &quot;temperate rain forest&quot; with the canopy produced by both trees and vines.  Both jungle and rain forest have their own distinct environment with the high level of moisture recycling from the forest, back to the forest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technical, maybe. But isn't this really why etymology exists? I would wager if you said the world &quot;jungle&quot; to most native English speakers, they would think of a tropical forest, damp, humid, with trees consisting of wide leaves, light green foliage in general, several species of reptiles and amphibians, vines, etc. Think Vietnam or Brazil. If you say &quot;forest&quot;, think more deciduous, temperate forests with conifers, foxes, grizzly bears, wolves, rabbits, deer, etc. Think U.S Pacific Northwest or Europe. I imagine you already had my answer in mind with the nature and allusion of your question, but in short, I think you think like most English speakers, and so even though the differences are more interpretation than technical, language is meant for effective communication than technical science, so the differentiation I believe would be important and correct </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also it has to do where the carbon is held the most in the Carbon Cycle. In the jungles the carbon is held in the actual organisms, the plants above land. In the forests the carbon is located mostly in the soil. That is why it is particularly dangerous to cut down the trees in the rainforest (jungle) because we are extracting the Carbon from the cycle and not giving it an opportunity to recuperate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
