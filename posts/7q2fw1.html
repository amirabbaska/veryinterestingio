		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main danger with freezing is that the ice crystals that form poke holes in the cell membranes. Without functional cell membranes there is nothing (or at least not enough) to keep your cell-stuff in place and the cell dies pretty quickly. This is also how all antibacterial <em>chemicals</em> like soaps and alcohol work (NOT antibiotics).</p>
<p>Antifreeze prevents the formation of these ice crystals, or at least keeps them limited in some way that they do less or no damage to the cell membranes. This is actually used in microbiological labs; if you want to freeze your cells or bacteria, you put them with a bit of some specific antifreeze component.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for most cells and bacteria antifreeze is also very toxic. But, some animals have evolved components that act with a similar function as antifreeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with the size of the animal, and protection it may have from damage caused by freezing. </p>
<p>It takes longer to freeze a pound of meat, than a hot dog due to mass and how thick it is affects length of time for the center to cool. A gentleman by the name of Birdseye discovered that food frozen in the beginning of winter, often preserved worse than food frozen during the  height of winter. He came up with the concept of flash freezing produce to ship from farm to peoples homes. </p>
<p>What they found was that the faster something freezes, the smaller the ice crystals are, which limits cellular damage. Freeze a frog, or an ear of corn, slowly, and ice crystals turn the flesh to mush. Flash freeze them, and they are still 'fresh' when thawed, and crisp and intact. </p>
<p>the frogs that can freeze and thaw,  have very small bodies, so that helps with time it takes to freeze, but it also helps with time it takes to thaw. The limbs of the frog will thaw first, while the center of it's body will still be frozen. Limbs without a beating heart will quickly begin to suffocate so thawing requires this doesn't go on too long. The physical size of the frog helps with that and it tends to thaw pretty evenly. </p>
<p>A mammal could similarly survive a freeze but it would have to be small enough to freeze quickly, much smaller than a mouse, and it would benefit from cellular antifreeze which is seen in some reptiles and fish, but not mammals yet. Not that it wouldn't work in mammals, just that mammals evolutionary niche is to go into low energy mode during winter, or hibernate, rather than to freeze, so evolution hasn't really selected for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
