		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ant colonies can die off in a variety of ways. Mites, other forms of parasites, ant wars, death of the queen, lack of food or sugar or water, predators, disease, and so many more. A colony can usually grow proportionate to its amount of resources, and room to roam. I am not sure how old the oldest ant colony is, but many colonies in captivity have survived for many years. Most colonies with only a single queen only last until her death. This is due to the fact that queen alates(young queen ants and their male equivalents) participate in yearly nuptial flights when they leave to mate. Male alates die right after this, but female alates that do make begin an entirely new colony, with only a few eggs to start. There are some species of ants that can have several queens however, and if the acclamation of the new queen goes well each time theoretically a colony could live forever.</p>

<p>&quot;David Holway, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist from UC San Diego, takes us to a driveway in Escondido, California where a grisly battle rages. In this quiet suburban spot, two groups of ants are putting on a chilling display of dismemberment and death. According to David, this battle line marks the edge of an enormous super-colony of Argentine ants. Think of that anthill in your backyard, and stretch it out across five continents.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Monogyne colonies (1 queen) can die off when the queen runs out of sperm. </p>
<p>Ant genetics are a little weird. The females come from fertilised eggs, while the males come from unfertilised eggs, meaning they're haploid. Since the workers are all female, it means the queen needs a ready supply of sperm, preferably not her own sons. So they store sperm from the nuptual flight in an organ called spermatheca. Though it will be rare (due to other forms of mortality), the queen can run out of sperm. The colony can't make more workers, so it will eventually die off.</p>
