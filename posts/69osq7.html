		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk if 'most animals' is accurate, but I guess it's relative. Lots of turtles, parrots, big mammals like elephants, and a PLETHORA of marine life can live longer than the average human! In ancient nature we had much shorter life spans, but with modern medicine and agricultural advances we've been able to extend our own life cycles; this doesn't mean we were necessarily long-living creatures before, where as Greenland sharks can live for upwards of 150 years with no medical or other interventions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, lifespan is related to the time it takes to raise one litter of progeny.  It takes longer to raise a human infant to adulthood than almost any other animal.  </p>
<p>So if a bear mom dies at 16 she may have raised several litters.  But a human mom would be leaving behind a helpless toddler.  </p>
<p>Since we evolved language and a second data set beyond our genes, It has been of benefit for parents to live long enough to share their wisdom about things later in life, like how to be a parent.</p>
<p>Contrast, animals young who require no care die after spawning/laying eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to point out that humans have had the capacity to live relatively long lives for much of our existence. Even before medicine, agriculture, and scientific advances, an individual could live for 60-70 years if they made it past childhood and could avoid predators and/or injury. Humans and our primate relatives take much longer to develop and reach sexual maturity and cannot reproduce as frequently--necessitating a relatively longer life in order to reproduce and raise offspring. Our metabolism is much slower than mammals of similar size, resulting in slower growth and less frequent cell turnover, which causes the accumulation of DNA damage associated with aging.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every response I've seen here is answering about lifespans, but OP asked about life cycles.</p>
<p>I don't know the answer but I'd imagine it might have something to do with us being a highly intelligent species.  It takes a long time for our brains to fully develop. A mother with a more fully formed brain would be better fit to help her child survive in the wild.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason longer lifespans were probably selected for in human ancestors is that older members could pass on their knowledge to future generations, and could take care of kids while the younger adults were out gathering food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
