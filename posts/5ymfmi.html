This is assuming that you use the minimum amount of fissile material required to produce the explosion. I know that there has been nuclear artillery and small form-factor &quot;suitcase nukes&quot; produced in the past but what I am really curious about is the effects of the absolute smallest (not form factor wise) explosion that could be produced. I realize this is probably different depending on which fissile material is used to produce the explosion.</p>
<p>I am more interested in the actual explosive properties than the radiological effects of the device. If you made a bomb designed to produce the smallest nuclear explosion that the laws of physics deem viable how much explosive power would it yield? Could you make a nuclear device small enough to level only a ten foot diameter for example? Or would the smallest feasible nuclear explosion be bigger than that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really any limit to &quot;smallest explosive output.&quot; You just end up sliding from a functional definition of a &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; into something like a &quot;prompt criticality excursion.&quot; For example, in 1954 an experimental setup called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godiva_device" target="_blank">Godiva</a> at Los Alamos created a briefly supercritical mass that was able to undergo 5.6 × 10^16 fissions before the energy broke it apart. (<a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Godiva-before-and-after.jpg" target="_blank">Before and after</a>.) That's about 400 grams of TNT equivalent. Is that a nuclear bomb? Not much of one. Did it form a critical mass? It did, <em>briefly</em>.  </p>
<p>(Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/cX4ST5U2Q54?t=21s" target="_blank">400 grams of gunpowder</a>, for comparison. The Godiva accident would have been less bang-y than that, because a lot of the energy would be expressed as heat and radiation, not blast. Most of the blast from a big nuclear bomb comes from superheating the air, and it wouldn't have been large enough to do that. Probably more like the bang of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gxySduIFc" target="_blank">5 grams of TNT</a>? Just a rough estimate.) </p>
<p>Could you make a bomb that only destroyed things within 10 feet? I don't see why not. Figure out what the TNT equivalent is, then figure out how many fissions it requires, then figure out what low level of efficiency in a critical mass you'd want to have. It could be done. It would be ridiculously wasteful of expensive material (the TNT would be orders of magnitude cheaper), and probably not a practical weapon (the apparatus would be very strange, to get just that sliver of a reaction and then stop it). But keep in mind that what we're talking about here is not a bomb dedicated to producing that explosive efficiently out of a tiny mass of fissile material, but a bomb that <em>if it were set up differently</em> would produce a lot more of a boom, and what you're doing is making it very, very inefficient. </p>
<p>If your question is, instead, what if we had a bomb of 100% efficiency (or at least something reasonable), could we make it work with only a tiny tiny tiny amount of fissile material? Probably not — this is where the critical mass stuff works against you. You need a certain number of atoms at a certain density with a certain lack of neutron loss to get the reaction started in the first place. The things I've been talking about are systems that could probably go seriously critical (they have enough atoms in the right density) but you're only using a fraction of their capability. That's different from saying, &quot;I only want a handful of atoms and I want them all to fission.&quot; That's not very likely to work out. </p>
<p>This is separate from the question of how physically small you could make a bomb, or how little material you could use. Physical smallness generally requires somewhat more material than you might expect, because you are probably going to get a lot lower efficiency out of the weapon. That is, the heaviness and largeness of the weapon are usually things that improve the efficiency, like tampers and reflectors and better high explosives. Shrinking those means lower efficiency, lower yield per unit of fissile material.</p>
<p>So the Davy Crockett (W-54) bomb had (apparently) around 1.6 kg of Pu-239 and 2.42 kg of U-235, to get an explosion of around 20 tons of TNT. That's a weapon efficiency of only 0.03% (which is to say, only 0.03% of the total energy in that plutonium and uranium were released — if <em>all</em> of it had fissioned, it would have released around 74 kt; an efficiency of 10-20% would be easily achievable in a larger weapon with that material).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.  I've been reading about tactical nuclear weapons that are small enough to fit in a backpack.  The problem with very small tactical nukes is not blowing up the soldiers delivering them; the blast radius has to be small enough to allow the soldier to get clear before it goes off.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuclear_device" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuclear_device</a></p>
<p>Although I'd love to hear about the theoretical possibilities, I believe current R&amp;D on this is limited due to nuclear arms treaties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you are asking for the smallest possible yield and/or blast radius. The shape of the blast could alter which of these is 'smaller' as well. You could create a more narrow, but taller, blast with a shaped mass.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)" target="_blank">Project Orion</a> was a theorized system of spaceship propulsion with a series of tiny nukes that go off one after another. The wiki (in a section based on Dyson's book on the subject) mentions: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In late 1958 to early 1959, it was realized that the smallest practical vehicle would be determined by the <strong>smallest achievable bomb yield</strong>. The use of <strong>0.03 kt (sea-level yield) bombs</strong> would give vehicle mass of 880 tons. However, this was regarded as too small for anything other than an orbital test vehicle and the team soon focused on a 4,000 ton &quot;base design&quot;. [note: <em>next part is a few paragraphs earlier</em>] The optimal Orion drive bomblet yield (for the human crewed 4,000 ton reference design) was calculated to be in the region of 0.15 kt, with approx 800 bombs needed to orbit and a bomb rate of approx 1 per second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So at least at this point, the smallest yield bomb they theorized was around 0.03 kilotons of TNT or 30 tons of TNT. </p>
<p>Using <a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=0.015&amp;lat=40.72422&amp;lng=-73.99611&amp;airburst=0&amp;hob_ft=0&amp;crater=1&amp;casualties=1&amp;fallout=1&amp;psi=20,5,1.5&amp;zm=15" target="_blank">NUKEMap</a> software, made by /u/restricteddata, a 30 Ton blast would have the following effects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Effects radii for 30 ton surface burst (smallest to largest):<br />
Crater inside radius: 10 m (110 m²)<br />
Crater depth: 0 ft<br />
Crater lip radius: 10 m (450 m²)<br />
Fireball radius: 20 m (1,190 m²)<br />
Air blast radius (20 psi): 70 m (0.01 km²)<br />
Air blast radius (5 psi): 140 m (0.06 km²)<br />
Thermal radiation radius (3rd degree burns): 160 m (0.08 km²)<br />
Air blast radius (1.5 psi): 300 m (0.29 km²)<br />
Radiation radius (500 rem): 460 m (0.66 km²)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 10-300 meters depending what you are measuring the blast from, excluding shaping the reaction mass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand the smallest nuclear weapons are in use as tactical nuclear weapons. Generally speaking, they would be used as part of nuclear artillery.</p>
<p>Nuclear artillery uses regular artillery, self propelled, vehicle carried or whatever, to fire an artillery shell which has a small nuclear warhead on it.</p>
<p>The purpose is a large amount of explosive capability in a smaller package which could be used on larger targets.</p>
<p>Nuclear artillery was planned to be used against ships, especially aircraft carriers, and convoys of armoured vehicles including tanks.</p>
<p>I understand only the UK and France were interested in nuclear artillery and developed it in the West. Germany and a few other nations were also trained to use nuclear artillery in such events. If they ever did use nuclear artillery, the nuclear shells would be provided in advance by the UK or France.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union also developed nuclear artillery, but did not plan on its use as much as the West did. Nuclear artillery was at the end of the day supposed to be used against a large scale invasion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is: What would you consider an explosion? Nuclear bombs follow the principle of the mass defect. This means while forming a nucleus parts of the mass from the nucleons is transformed into energy thus making the nucleus lighter than it should be. This follows the E=m<em>c^2 mass-energy equivalent. When a nucleus decays the engergy given away can be calculated with this.
Example:
U 236: Mass: 236.045568 u Protons: 92 Neutrons: 236-92=144 Decay: alpha
Th 232: Mass: 232.0380553 u Protons: 90 Neutrons: 232-90=142
Alpha: Mass: 4.00151 u Protons: 2 Neutrons: 4-2=2
The mass defect (md) for each nucleus is: (nProtons</em>mProtons+nNeutrons<em>mNeutrons)-mNucleus so as example for Uranium: (92</em> 1007276+144<em> 1.008665)- 236.045568. After repeating this for every of the nucleus you have to subtract the different values from each other to calculate the difference: (md Thorium+ md Alpha)- md Uranium =md Overall. Then you have to mulipy this with the factor c^2 =931.5 MeV/u to get the energy released. For this example this would be 4.572 MeV (7.324344 </em>10^-13 J).
So for each decay happening this is the amount of energy released. Additionaly Alpha and beta particles are released which can trigger the next decays resulting in a chain reaction. Therefore the smallest &quot;explosion&quot; would just be one nucleus. But as you can see for delivering the amount of energy from a 9mm (400 J) you would need 5,46 <em>10^14 decays of this kind at once. (about 2,146 </em>10^-7 g)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
