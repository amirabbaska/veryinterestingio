		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In space, there's nothing. The only source of ambient light comes from stars. That means if you are inside the solar system and there isn't a planet in the way, you're gonna see very well. Things will be very bright on the side facing the sun, but shadowed on the other side.</p>
<p>If the sun is blocked, you will still receive light from other celestial bodies and the milky way, which will give you extremely dim vision. You will be able to see a little bit in front of you, but not enough to distinguish complex things.</p>
<p>If you leave the solar system, same thing, but even darker because celestial bodies like the moon or saturn will reflect a little bit of light, depending on where you are. So without those, it'll be pretty dark. Very difficult to recognize objects probably, but if someone waves something in your face you could see it (Especially since it'll block stars behind it from your vision). If you leave the milky way and hang out in between galaxies, it'll be even dimmer, so much that it's gonna be almost impossible to see anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere on the Internet NASA has a page describing how much light there is and what you can see. If I were there I would be sure I had a flashlight. Maybe I would sprinkle powder and shine the light on the powder to get a diffuse illumination. Or I could shine the light on a nearby surface to use the surface as an illumination source.</p>
<p>It really is pretty dark. I mean, think of a moonless night on Earth. It would be no brighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shadows are very dark.  On Earth, shadows are dim but not completely dark because light scatters from air molecules into the shadows.  In space, there is no air to scatter the light, so anywhere in shadow from all illumination sources is damn near invisible.  Contrariwise, objects in bright illumination like sunlight will often reflect a brighter glare than you would get in atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
