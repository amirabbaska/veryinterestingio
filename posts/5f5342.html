What I'm wondering is at what distance do you consider something to be global rather than local? </p>
<p>That might be a plain misunderstanding from my part, so alternatively, is it more correct that the local measurment is just an approximation of the global one, since we don't expect any significant space-time curvature in proximity of the measurment (and therefore, the measurment is actually a tiny bit inaccurate)?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you need to know how we define and measure relative velocity of two objects in pre-relativity physics. Our reference frame is fixed and there are two objects, each traveling on some path through space. The tangent vector to each path is the velocity of the respective object. The difference in the two velocity vectors is then their relative velocity. This is all pretty simple, but there's actually a lot going on in the background, almost all of which is properly discussed and detailed in an introductory course in differential geometry.</p>
<p>The path of the particle is some set of points in R^(3) (3-dimensional space), but the velocity vector at each point on the path is a vector in the <em>tangent space</em> at each point in the path. In principle, these tangent spaces are all different. So it makes no sense to subtract or add vectors in different tangent spaces. That is, relative velocity really makes no sense as I have described it. <em>However</em>, and this is the key, if the underlying manifold has no curvature (as is the case in pre-relativity physics), then there is a canonical way to identify any tangent space with any other tangent space. Thus there is a canonical way to add and subtract vectors in different tangent spaces.</p>
<p>Okay... I know that's tough to swallow if you don't have the right mathematical background. (Differential geometry isn't exactly easy anyway.) Part of the difficulty is that a manifold with no curvature is almost too simple and so a lot of the subtleties introduced with curvature get swept under the rug. It's actually a bit easier to grasp if we look at what happens in a curved space. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Parallel_Transport.svg" target="_blank">Consider this figure.</a>. Suppose we are at point A and at rest. Some object at point B is traveling on some path (not shown), but its velocity vector is the vector shown at point B. Question: what is the velocity of that object relative to us? Since the object's velocity vector lies in a different tangent space than our tangent space (since points A and B are different points), we have to first move the object's velocity vector into our tangent space. But how should we do that? We can move the velocity vector on a <em>geodesic</em> directly from point B to point A. Or we can move the velocity vector on a geodesic from B to N, then N to A. The problem is that we get a different result (note that the defect angle). </p>
<p>This process of transporting a vector along the geodesic while keeping it parallel to itself is generally called <em>parallel transport</em>. In a curved manifold, the result of parallel transport <em>depends on the path taken during transport</em>. If the manifold has zero curvature, however, the result is the same no matter what. That's why in pre-relativity physics and in special relativity, relative velocity of objects not at the same point is perfectly well-defined.</p>
<hr />
<p>So that was all to explain essentially that in general relativity, <em>the relative velocity of distant objects is ill-defined</em>. (By distant we really just mean objects not at the same point.) So what is meant by the local speed of light? This is a term that really just means the <em>coordinate speed of light</em>. We first fix our coordinate system. Then we can examine the path taken by light rays. The speed of those light rays in those coordinates is what we call the local speed of light. This speed can vary from point to point, can exceed <em>c</em>, can be less than <em>c</em>, and can be different for different observers. This is all ultimately because spacetime is a <em>curved</em> manifold. Things like &quot;speed of light is constant and invariant between observers&quot; simply are not consistent with there being non-zero curvature.</p>
<p>Instead, in GR we say that the speed of light is invariant only to a <em>local</em> inertial observer. That means the following. Remember that we can always define the relative velocity of objects passing right by us since all of their velocity vectors lie in the same tangent space (namely the tangent space at our location). Suppose that at some fixed point <em>P</em> we have set up several observers, which may themselves have some non-zero relative velocity with respect to each other. If a light ray passes by them (i.e., passes through <em>P</em>), then all of the observers measure its speed to be <em>c</em>. This is what you expect from special relativity. The only difference in GR now is that if those same observers measured the speed of the light ray on some other point of its path, then the observers can get different speeds. That's perfectly fine. (It's not an &quot;anything goes&quot; type situation though. Once you pick your coordinates, the local speed of light is still the maximum speed of any causal path at that point. So, for instance, if in your coordinates the local speed of light at some point <em>Q</em> is <em>c</em>/2, then no object can have a larger coordinate speed at <em>Q</em>.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general relativity, the global speed of something is not well-defined. You can set that speed to any suitable value smaller than or greater than c. </p>
<p>When you think about it it's not very surprising. Imagine sending light in a circle using mirrors. Its average speed measured using its start and end point and the time difference is 0 (the distance it traveled overall is 0), but that has nothing to do with what the actual speed is (close to c everywhere in the circle). </p>
<p>What this shows is that &quot;average speed&quot; is not a physically well-defined observable that is independent of reference frame or even covariant with it like energy or momentum. Instead, it's completely arbitrary. What General Relativity does is it allows spacetime to take the place of the mirrors, so that you don't need a special apparatus to disturb the &quot;average speed&quot;, and you can increase the apparent speed as well as decreasing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
