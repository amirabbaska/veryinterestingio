		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of typical &quot;telomeres&quot; answers, but that's BS.  Your body can create eggs in which the telomeres are restored, allowing for a new human baby that can then continue to grow up normally. Thus, clearly a mechanism exists to correct the loss of telomeres (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase" target="_blank">telomerase</a>).  Further, research with rats has shown that disabling telomerase has little to no effect on the health or aging processes of rats for up to 6 generations.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is currently not well understood but appears to be related to the scientific field known as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetics</a>&quot;.  Epigenetics is the study of how gene expression changes over your lifetime and how these changes in expression can be handed down over generations.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this, why is it that every cell in your body has the same DNA and yet some cells grow up to be skin, others to be brain or muscle or liver?  Epigenetics! i.e. the selective expression of some genes over others.</p>
<p>The reason an egg can become a new human that doesn't possess the age of its parent is because the epigenetic markers of the parent are &quot;reset&quot; when the egg is produced.  This suggests that age is a process by which epigenetic changes accumulate over the life span of an organism.  These changes may be somewhat programmed to happen, but are also influenced by environment (e.g. toxins from smoking that reduce life span).  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014821" target="_blank">In fact, your age can be &quot;guessed&quot; to within about +/- 5 years just by counting the number of epigenetic markers in your DNA.</a></p>
<p>So, to answer your question, the most likely cause of aging is that we are in fact programmed to do so.  We die because evolution wants us too.  Death is advantageous to life and so it is programmed into the very fabric of our being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot like a car.</p>
<p>A new car you want to repair and replace as much as you can. As the car ages, it gets more expensive and time consuming to repair, and easier to just replace the whole thing.</p>
<p>Now consider that evolution is about what survives and prospers as a species. And consider the innumerable dangers that could destroy an organism. Nature has a few creatures that do effectively live forever, but as a general rule, replacing constantly works better, so that is what prospered and spread.</p>
<p>Also note your own body does the same thing. Rather than make cells that never die, it constantly removed and replaces cells. It's such a good system that some of your cells even self destruct or kill other cells to make this happen.</p>
<p>Further, note that replacement allows evolution to happen faster. The shorter a creature lives before procreation and the less it sticks around after, the more changes will happen.</p>
<p>Edit: to summarize, it's possible, but evolutionarily speaking, not desirable. Creatures actually moved away from that as time went on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lifespan is related to cancer. The body has a cellular clock that will tick down as the cells replicate (telomeres), providing a significant barrier to the development of cancer: if you grow out of control but don't surmount this mechanism, you will eventually die. New bodies are produced from a single cell (egg+sperm) that starts this clock all over again. If this cell is defunct in some way and doesn't replicate properly, it is basically just ejected and you try again. The loss of an embryo is not significant to the organism<br />
Brief edit: to clarify, the clock is deliberate, you trade likely dying from cancer at the ripe age of 4 for an eventual expiration date</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because as cells duplicate, they lose a little bit of DNA on the top and bottom. The first few times it doesn`t matter, because the DNA lost is &quot;Junk&quot; DNA, or DNA that doesn't serve any other purpose, but eventually all the Junk DNA is removed and the cell can no longer duplicate because it would lose essential DNA. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
