		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I politely disagree with many of those posting here. Let me try to ELI5.</p>
<p>Pressure isn't as large of a factor as you might think. It is to us, because we're not adapted to it and our bodies really can't take it. But, we and most other things are actually made out of liquids. Liquid doesn't squish very much. Food is what decides how big things get.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about size and think about fish, well, they only get so big. Whale sharks are pretty huge for a fish, but compared to warm blooded mammals,  the great whales, they're actually pretty average. Ironically, the largest boney fish - the Sun Fish - spends most of its time quite deep, hunting jellyfish. But it has to come up to the warmer waters near the surface to warm up from time to time. It's hard being cold-blooded. It takes energy to do things and that's why food is such an important factor.</p>
<p>Many deeper ocean creatures that are active predators - that hunt for food, instead of just kind of gather it - don't stay in the deep parts all the time. They &quot;go out for dinner&quot; coming to the shallows to hunt and then go back down later. Some of these are quite large, especially among jellyfish &amp; their relatives and squids. It is believed the largest squids in the world live this way. And some of them wouldn't fit in your living room, OP. Even at the bottom there are some big sharks that move about - six gill, seven gill and sleeper sharks can get big - longer and larger than a car.</p>
<p>Then there's the mammals that spend a bit of time in the deeper ocean, like sperm whales. They're big.</p>
<p>Then there's the things that live down there all the time. The majority of these are small, limited in size mostly due the availability of food. However, on the abyssal plain - the sandy flat part of the ocean between the mountains that form islands and sea mounts and the crevices that form trenches - there are fields and fields of spiny skinned sea stars and sea urchins, walking along in their tube feet, hoovering up food that's slowly sunk down to the bottom. They move in giant herds. There's so many, and the area is so big - it's the single largest habitat on Earth - that they might actually be the largest amount of animals on the planet, by weight. That's despite what everyone says about bugs. Beetles. Everyone thinks they're so cool.</p>
<p>But then there's the bottoms of the trenches. So far there's no Pacific Rim sized Kayju down there that we've found, but when you stop thinking fish and start thinking other things there's some real possibility.</p>
<p>Hydrothermic vents are these cracks in the sea floor where really hot (like hotter than boiling) water comes shooting out, full of chemicals. There are creatures that can live next to these vents and live in the water who use the chemicals in the water for food. There's a type of tube worm that lives there that can stand hotter than boiling water, that has no digestive tract - no tummy, no intestines and never goes poop - that is over 1 metre long. That may not sound all that big, but that's pretty huge for a tube worm. They appear to be limited in size by the size of the vents they live on. Vents are little underwater volcanos. Get a big one and you get big tube worms. There are some rather large colonial jellyfish types down there that grow to be the size of a football field in length. That's pretty big.</p>
<p>Then there's the less impressive - mostly because they don't move around - but really huge bottom dwellers. Deep sea corals can be hundreds of meters long, just like their shallow water counterparts. As corals grow they leave their skeletons behind, which is what makes up reefs. There are massive deep-sea sponges that are thousands of years old. Then there are things like the methane-seep living cyanobacteria colonies. Those things are miles and miles across - bigger than anything on land. I don't expect them to wade ashore to crush Tokyo anytime soon tho. They get massive because they live right next to a food source that's been like an all you can eat buffet for thousands of years, and is still going strong.</p>
<p>TLDR: Pressure isn't that big of a deal. It's all about food.</p>
<p>EDIT: Removed an elephant to whale shark comparison as it was just plain wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other than that, I could imagine some kind of a fungal-like organism to basically cover the whole ocean floor. For creatures that would loosely resemble something from deep-sea horror movies, I'd imagine that mobility and food become an issue relatively soon; Surface area will grow proportionally more than body size, while body mass will grow by even more than surface area, as per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law" target="_blank">square-cube law</a>. You'll get slower while needing more and more food to eat.</p>
<p>Also, if such humongous creatures were even remotely usual, I would imagine that there would have been some passing evidence of their existence by now. In sonars, carcasses or scars of existing large animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sorts of limits imposed really depend on what type of animal it is. (This is really fun to think about by the way)</p>
<p>Many of these limits will be closely related to something called the square-cube law. As you begin to scale things up, the ratio of volume to surface area and volume to area of a cross section changes drastically even though the shape remains the same. If you take a 2x2x2 cube and compare its volume (8) surface area (24) and cross-section (4) to a 4x4x4 cube (64, 96, and 16) the effect is pretty clear.</p>
<p>This is important because the volume is directly related to mass/weight, the cross section to how much force it takes to bend and break materials, and the surface area related to things like heat dissipation and the diffusion of things like oxygen through a membrane. As you get larger, your biomass increases much more quickly than your ability to support it! Bones can become so large that they crumble under their own weight, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep sea creatures are limited by these main resources: finding food, pressure, extreme cold, no light, and finding mates.</p>
<p>As far as size goes, there are some pretty big deep sea creatures (think giant squid or colossal squid). The majority are much more reasonable sizes. Other animals that use the deep sea also will be quite larger (think sperm whales). </p>
<p>For deep sea inhabitants: The extreme cold causes them to have a really slow metabolism, which in turn causes them to not need as much food for animals of a similar size. They move slow, eat less and their cellular processes are slower. So size is limited less by food and more by slow metabolism. They can get big, but it takes a long time (again, the giant squid is an exception, those are thought to have crazy short lifespans).  More times than not, the energy to survive, find a mate and reproduce are so great in the deep that putting resources to size are not often a priority.</p>
<p>For animals that use the deep sea: These guys tend to be big because of the cold. Sperm whales and the like have a lower surface area to retain their internal heat more easily. </p>
<p>Theoretically, there could be some massive deep sea creatures if they are really old and generalist feeders.. but extremely unlikely. A metabolism for something that big couldn't easily be sustained. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the deepest point, pressure is 1000 atmospheres, which can have some pretty screwy effects on gaseous chemistry but I'm not qualified enough to say whether it screws up chemistry in solution. Water only occupies 95% of the space per unit mass that it did at sea level for Christ sake. </p>
<p>The biggest thing though, apart from being a bit nippy (1-4deg C), it's dark. Really dark. Like, no light.</p>
<p>That means that stuff that photosynthesises does not live down there. That's the bottom tier of the entire world's eco systems missing. That means that to live down there, you'll be eating whatever drifts down from the busy photosynthesising layer above or some sort of weird alien biology based around sulphurous volcanic vents. </p>
<p>If you are a life form looking to eat today, pickings are going to be slim. This might well limit your growth more than freaky chemistry, being blind, cold or squeezed.</p>
<p>Really though, the answer to a lot of this is &quot;we don't know&quot;, space is easier to go to in comparison to the abyssal floor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
