		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all regulated by your brain, but it's not a conscious thing. As an interesting example of this the reason you feel chills when you have a fever is because there are chemicals being released in your body in response to an infection which increases your body's &quot;thermostat&quot; to a higher level. In the time between your body raising the &quot;set point&quot; (a rapid change) and actually increasing the temperature to the new &quot;set point&quot; (a slower change), your body thinks it is colder than it should be, inducing the chills in spite of an actually elevated temperature. So manipulation of the brain via medications such as antipyretics can also change how the body interprets its thermodynamic state to some degree. That being said, this is not a conscious decision, so you wouldn't be able to run around outside in the cold and not shiver, in the same way you can't will yourself to not feel pain or hunger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Body temperature is controlled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" target="_blank">hypothalamus</a>, which contain neurons that respond to changes in body temperature as well as neurons that serve to signal thermoregulatory responses in the body, such as sweating or shivering (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870994/" target="_blank">Review Source</a>).  </p>
<p>These temperature-sensing neurons respond to some combination of changes in both the periphery (ie, skin) as well as core (ie, viscera and brain).  This is achieved through signalling both from neurons that are intrinsically temperature sensitive (sensing core temperature) as well as through the spinal cord (sensing peripheral temperature).</p>
<p>In terms of answering your question, if you were legitimately convinced that you were warm, even though your core temperature was dropping, then that would be a sign of serious problems within your hypothalamus.  This is not a region of the brain which can normally be willfully controlled, although certain mental states can affect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your body has thermoreceptors in the spinal cord and near the skin for measuring core body temperature and ambient temperature. The latter is what makes you &quot;feel&quot; cold. The former is what controls thermoregulatory mechanisms such as sweating or shivering. </p>
<p>They both go to the anterior hypothalmus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body's sensory &quot;afferent&quot; signals would be bombarding your brain with input about how cold it is. You may be able to tell yourself that you're warm, but in reality, your autonomic nervous system is telling you that it's COLD so your body would involuntarily start shivering as a natural response. So yes, even though you're telling yourself it's warm... your body and mind perceive otherwise and you would start shivering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm as a kid I used to be stubborn and like to fight cold(live in Canada,with winter jacket) I'd shiver a lot, but then I'd tell myself, this is all bs (kid thinking) stop shivering, stand up straight, you are NOT cold. This method has abled me to stay out in the cold a lot more comfortably. It always led me to believe that somehow I can control my bodys reaction to temp. For awhile there I thought I had super powers hehehe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
