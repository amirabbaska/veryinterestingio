<p>Actually, healthy human lungs are extremely efficient, you’re just looking at the process from the wrong end.</p>
<p>You are correct that when we breathe in, the air contains roughly 21% O2, and when we breathe out, the O2 concentration is down to about 16%. But, look at what is happening to your blood - when it comes into the lung, it still holds about 75% of the total amount of oxygen that can be carried (either by hemoglobin or dissolved within the water component of blood)*; when it leaves the lung, it is 98–100% saturated. Laws of chemistry and physics prevent you from being able to absorb any more oxygen.</p>
<p>Think of it like going to the grocery store to restock your pantry - you don’t buy out the whole grocery store just because the food is there, you just buy what you can effectively store and use.</p>
<p>*Venous blood still holds 75% of the total oxygen it can carry, which shows that our other tissues can only extract about 25% of the oxygen drawn in as we breathe. We don’t use most of the oxygen that we breath in.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our rate of respiration has more to do with our need to blow off CO2. CO2 in our system makes our blood serum acidic, and it needs to stay with in a strict pH range. That's why in extreme diabetic episodes people tend to hyperventilate. The body is burning fat which makes the blood more acidic than it would be burning glucose (ketoacidosis), and hyperventaaltion is necessary to compensate. Homeostasis is fascinating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The longer you hold your breath, the more oxygen gets processed by your lungs. The burning sensation as you hold your breath is CO2 building up as this happens. You could theoretically hold all your breaths long enough to fully process the oxygen within but it would be very uncomfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm to lazy to make my own ELI5: </p>
<p>I remember the 98-100% saturated thing from lectures. My question is, what are athletes doing on the sidelines with the mask that they're breathing through? If it's 98-100% oxygenation with 21% o2, I can't imagine a mask giving even 100% o2 makes a difference. So are they just increasing their oxygen reservoir of the lungs? This seems like it would only make a difference if you were going to be holding your breath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
