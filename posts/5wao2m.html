<p>It seems because the government covers it there will not be a pop just a slow in GDP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may have not popped because there may not be a bubble there at all.  A bubble, by definition, happens when some good/service sees unsubstantiated and artificial increases in price, usually due to manipulation by financial markets.  But the earnings premium for a college degree is higher than it has ever been before, and it continues to increase. <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/job-skill-trendsthe-college-wage-premium/27091" target="_blank">source</a>.  </p>
<p>Whereas in 1980 college graduates only make 40% more than non-grads, today the number is around 85%. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/earnings.htm#education" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>The ROI for college is higher than the stock market, bonds, real estate, and private equity. Unlike the housing bubble, a college degree’s increase in value over the years is very real and substantiated by data. </p>
<p>Even if there is a bubble, there are key differences between the housing crash and student loans. With a house, there’s an actual tangible asset that can reduce in market price very quickly when there’s an abrupt selling of houses. With higher education, there is nothing to be resold after it was bought. </p>
<p>While it might be sort of similar if many people defaulted on their loans at the same time and tax payers had to bail them out, this is not what is occurring. Even if it did, people would still have their degrees (unlike defaulting on a mortgage where your house gets taken). In fact, default rates have declined since the late 80s/early 90s. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2011-09-student-loan-default.html" target="_blank">source</a>. Most people end up paying their loans, many times over throughout their lives, and benefit greatly from having a degree. </p>
<p>And even if they didn’t, there still is very much “consumption” value in college, in the form of intellectual growth, social experience, etc. This would be impossible to repossess as well. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there needs to be MUCH reform. I think guaranteed federal loans are bad policy. But I don't expect to see a massive financial fallout from student loans. </p>
<p>TL; DR... Your original post assumes a bubble exists.  It might not, and even if it did, there are key differences between student loans and housing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to get lost in the comments but I'd also argue that the general lack of academic standards for public high schools as well as state testing has also helped build the bubble. </p>
<p>Speaking as a teacher, there are too many high school students who are going to colleges where they are going to either academically or financially struggle at. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most profound experience of my undergrad degree was hearing a Marxist economist (someone who studies Marxian theory, not a crazy person) postulate that by creating the notion that one needs a degree to work, corporations have essentially indentured the middle class to a life of working really hard and sometimes in morally objectionable jobs in order to not get crushed under their own debt. With no time for anything else, these people are politically pacified. He liked it to a trip to the new world. They'll pay for the trip but you'll spend the rest of your life paying them back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
