		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My Dad was a TV weatherman, 1985 to 95 BBC South Today.</p>
<p>First off I'm in the UK so things here may be different. He was on national radio for around 10 years then local TV for another ten years or so. My dad worked for 40 years for the Meteorological Office. A government job, we call that civil service here in the UK. When he joined the Met Office it was part of MoD Air (Ministry of Defence), I'm not sure if the Met Office is still an MoD department. He spent most of his early career working at military air bases(RAF). The end of his time with the Met Office was spent working at the Southampton Weather Centre.  A bit like a serviceman in the military we moved a lot. </p>
<p>So a working day would be spent in the office doing whatever weather forecasters do everything from wave height in the north sea (oil industry) special shipping forecasts for maritime industries, temperature data for the power companies. Special weather forecasts are real important to many commercial customers. The Met Office was one of the few governmental organisations to be profitable at the time in the UK. The BBC was another customer.</p>
<p>About an hour before his shift ended he would go to the TV studio. I know he made notes to be sure he had a good idea of what he wanted to say. However it was unscripted and there was no teleprompter. So that's unscripted live TV, an expert talking.  It could never be scripted because he never knew how much time he would have on the live show. His slot was at the end of the newscast so if something over-ran he got less time. Sometimes the hosts would want adlib a bit, this would cut into his time. Sometimes he would have plenty of time because the show was running short and have to pad a bit. The cut off time was an absolute because the end of the show would be when the local TV went back to the national feed. </p>
<p>So if you are from the UK and watching BBC the weather presenter is a civil servant and is almost certainly unscripted. Quite what will happen in coming years is unsure as the Met Office has lost the BBC contract. For the first time since 1922! Over 90  years the BBC has had Met Office staff giving us our weather forecasts. yes I'm a bit salty about the whole thing, the BBC is going to rat s**t...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Or they can be the people who also prepare the report and are able to comment on it with a degree of knowledge, and be able to discuss it with the other newscasters and therefore make their weather cast more interesting and authoritative. </p>
<p>It's really up to individual stations/news reports. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mom worked at a news station so I ran this by her, as well as the question from /u/HagBolder    </p>
<p>Some stations might have 1 meteorologist and a couple of weathermen. It was the Meteorologist's job to analyze the reports from the weather and make predictions. This would sometimes mean that they'd come in really early to prepare, or stay late at night. Sometimes they'll make a prerecorded clip of the weather in case they're not around during a live segment (such as during the late night news).     </p>
<p>A weatherman was usually someone looking to get into the business and either go into reporting or work for a degree in meteorology. They usually only needed a TV personality as well as an ability to perform on live TV.      </p>
<p>One of the other things that a weatherman might do is attend public events to represent the news station because their face and name is known and recognized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I started my TV career working at a couple news stations. First off, the weathermen that I worked with never read a prepared script to present the weather. All but one were meteorologists accredited by the AMA or other credentialed boards. They usuall spend the first part of the day building weather map animations and studying forecasting models.  </p>
<p>If you work in LA where the weather doesn't really change, you may see more talking heads(pretty girls) with no knowledge of what they are looking at on the maps or reading. On the other hand if you are near tornado alley or somewhere the weather is a serious issue where lives could be at stake, then the stations tend to hire people who know what they are doing and that are able to do wall-to-wall coverage during severe weather watches/warnings. </p>
<p>If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
