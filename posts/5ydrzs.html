		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>The Latin American governments were mostly neutral during the war. (Even Brazil, which did side with the Allies, only committed small numbers of combat forces.) Therefore capturing and prosecuting Nazi criminals was barely any sort of priority for the governments there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relative geographic isolation from Germany's WW2 enemies in Europe and North America. It's easier to get snatched by the Soviets or Americans if you're laying low somewhere in Europe versus in Latin America. That's not to say it made it <em>that</em> much safer- as the Adolf Eichmann operation proved- but it was a more secure alternative. </p>
</li>
<li>There were already German communities in some of these nations, particularly Argentina. This offered a opportunity to blend in and network with culturally similar people. </li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: spelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What on earth are some of these answers?</p>
<p>The correct answer is: between 1885 and 1914, there was a large influx in European immigration, to Argentina especially. <strong>Three million</strong>, 100,000 of whom spoke German. Nazi war criminals could blend in and disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Argentina was the second largest destination of European immigration in the 19th century, after the USA, and Brazil wasn't far behind -- so they had a ready-made ethnic Germanic population that fugitive Nazis could walk right into. And since their non-German neighbors hadn't been in a war with them, they assimilated with relative ease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very far away from the crime scene of eastern and central europe without being too close to any allied countries.
