		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have questions about land cover types, the GLOBE Observer app, our current Land Cover Challenge, app development, or land science in general? We are here to answer your questions.</p>
<p>NASA GLOBE Observer is a smart phone app that lets you take citizen science data for NASA.  And just this month the GLOBE Observer team launched the latest tool within the app called: &quot;Land Cover Adopt a Pixel&quot;.  This new feature lets you take part in a project to create more detailed satellite-based global maps of land cover by sharing photos of the world around you.</p>
<p>Why does NASA need your help in collecting this data with the new GLOBE Observer Land Cover tool? One reason is to fill in details of the landscape that are too small for global land-mapping satellites to see. Land cover is critical to many different processes on Earth and contributes to a community's vulnerability to disasters like fire, floods or landslides. Read more at <a href="http://go.nasa.gov/2NdWgwt" target="_blank">go.nasa.gov/2NdWgwt</a>.</p>
<p>(And don't forget there is still time to take part in our Land Cover Challenge.  All participants will receive a virtual badge within the app if they make a Land Cover observation using the app between now and NASA's 60th anniversary (October 1st). However, the top 10 citizen scientists who map the most land in this period will be recognized on GLOBE Observer social media by a NASA scientist and will receive a certificate of appreciation from GLOBE Observer.)</p>
<p>Here answering your questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peder Nelson - Land Scientist and the science lead for the Land Cover tool within the NASA GLOBE Observer app.</li>
<li>Holli Kohl - Coordinator for NASA GLOBE Observer</li>
<li>Kristen Weaver - Deputy Coordinator for NASA GLOBE Observer</li>
<li>Autumn Burdick - Communications Director for NASA GLOBE Observer</li>
<li>Tassia Owen - Team Member and Outreach/Communications Specialist for NASA GLOBE Observer</li>
<li>David Overoye - GLOBE/GLOBE Observer Data Information Systems Project Manager</li>
<li>Joe Wieclawek - Chief Applications Developer for NASA GLOBE Observer</li>

<p>A few companies are also promising high frequency images (the whole Earth every 24h kind of deal). What usage do you foresee for that kind of data?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool project! I've used Landsat data before and really like the commitment that NASA appears to have to open information sharing.  </p>
<p>Technical question: what kind of spatial resolution are you guys working at?<br />
Relatedly, I could imagine a scenario where some areas with a lower population density will not receive a lot of interest relatively. Of course, one could argue that these areas are also less interesting for many land cover data uses, but still, do you guys have a method in mind for dealing with this? And abroad? I'm currently looking into, among other things, remote sensing for disaster risk reduction in developing countries and the availability of high resolution data is often a problem; these kind of projects could really help, but at the same time of course in many developing countries such a project is also much harder to pull off...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
