I know light takes about 8 minutes 20 seconds to reach Earth, and is a theoretical limit to speed but gravity being a force is it faster or slower? </p>
<p>Googleing it confuses me more, and maybe I should have post this in r/explainlikeimfive , sorry    </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 'speed of gravity' is the same as the speed of light. </p>
<p>And while this is a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=speed+of+gravity&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all" target="_blank">frequently asked question on askscience</a>, I think I'd like to help you with your thought experiment about the sun's disappearance. </p>
<p>If the sun were to disappear very abruptly, it would produce a large gravitational wave - which is a ripple in spacetime - which would begin to travel out through the solar system. Remember how light is an electromagnetic wave, or a self-propagating ripple in electromagnetic fields produced by accelerated charges? A gravitational wave is exactly the same, but it's a ripple in spacetime curvature produced by accelerated masses. Anyway, the 'crest' of this gravitational wave would keep perfect pace with the last flash of light emitted from the sun before its disappearance. </p>
<p>For 8 minutes and 20 second, we will notice nothing on the earth. Life will continue as it did, with us receiving light from the sun, and the earth continuing on its elliptical orbit. The effect of this gravitational wave is to 'smooth out' the space it passes through, eliminating the spacetime curvature that was once produced by the sun's gravity. </p>
<p>Upon reaching the earth, we would (in the same instant) see the sun disappear and everything go dark (except for the screens of a billion cell phones which would light up as people try to figure out what's going on), and notice the planet get kicked so that it is no longer in an elliptical orbit, but now traveling in a straight line, like something thrown off of a merry-go-round. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4yyb_RNJWUM#t=201" target="_blank">In fact, Brian Greene gives a good explanation (with some pretty visuals) of exactly this in his series from a few years ago, and compares how the solar system would respond to the sun's disappearance in Newton's physics as compared to Einstein's physics.</a> Skip forward to about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4yyb_RNJWUM#t=443" target="_blank">7 minutes 20 seconds</a> to see a visualization for what I was trying to explain about the gravitational wave. </p>
<p>This is why the speed of light is so important to Einstein- this speed isn't just about <em>light</em>, but about all massless particles. It's a speed limit on the transmission of <em>information</em> which is of immeasurable importance when talking about <em>causality</em> in spacetime. In a naive sense, the earth can't receive information about the sun for 8 minutes, and when it does, that information (as a gravitational wave) changes the earth's orbit, so these two events (the sun disappearing and the earth getting kicked) are <em>causally connected</em>. This is an overwhelmingly important topic in physics, and making sure your theories preserve causality is one of the first litmus tests for whether a theory is any good. But since this post is getting long, I'll stop here.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#cite_note-LeClerq-3" target="_blank">According to special relativity, c is the maximum speed at which all matter and information in the universe can travel. It is the speed at which all massless particles and changes of the associated fields (including electromagnetic radiation such as light and gravitational waves) travel in vacuum.</a></p>
<p>If the Sun were to disappear, the Earth would &quot;learn&quot; of the loss of the Sun's gravitational field maximally fast. The maximum speed limit for any information propagation in the Universe is c. So we'd notice the disappearing light and gravity at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're asking is the very problem that prompted Einstein's theory of (general) relativity!  According to Newton's laws, gravity is the resultant force of two masses acting upon one another.  Anything with a mass has a gravitational pull on anything else with a mass.  However, if two masses were separated by a very large distance, and one of the masses changed, would the other mass feel the gravitational effect instantaneously?</p>
<p>Einstein postulated that even gravity does not present a problem to the theoretical limit of speed, because gravity is actually a result of bends in the fabric of space-time.  So once one mass changes, it influences space-time and correspondingly affects all other masses with this adjustment.  Gravity does not need to travel, because it is accounted for in the concept of space-time dimensionality!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
