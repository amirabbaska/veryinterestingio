		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your body as a machine, like an engine.  At cruising speed (walking) it can run pretty much forever until it runs out of fuel.  That's because the energy being asked of it is in the range that it is easy/efficient to produce with little to no extra fuel.  </p>
<p>Moving to higher speeds (running) requires more power which requires extra fuel be consumed. This requires more effort, which causes wear and more fuel to be consumed, which generates more heat that requires more effort and energy to disperse.  So, in much the same way a car's engine will try to overheat when you press the gas to make it go faster, your muscles are drawing more oxygen from your blood (fuel) and generating heat due to the extra effort of running.  Harder to analogize is the fact that this means your lungs are working hard to gather oxygen and expel CO2, which your hearts is pumping harder to distribute to your muscles which need that fuel to generate the extra effort required by running.  At the same time, the muscles are trying to dissipate the heat the extra effort generates as well as the lactic acid strenuous exercise may be generating</p>
<p>Then there's the whole effect of the difference in impact/weight distribution between walking and running, which varies by surface, body motion, etc....</p>
<p>tl;dr - It takes a lot more effort for your entire body to turn fuel into motion when running than it does to walk at a leisurely pace</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few of the answers here are a little misleading.  </p>
<p>Walking and running actually use very similar amounts of energy. The difference comes with how that energy is delivered.<br />
Let's say you walk one mile at a pace of 4 mph. It will take you 15 minutes to walk that mile and your circulatory system has 15 minutes to deliver the necessary resources your body needs to power you for that journey.<br />
Now, lets say you double that pace and jog a mile at 8 mph. Now your circulatory system only has 7.5 minutes to deliver all the necessary resources to your body and therefore has to work twice as hard.  </p>
<p>There are other minor reasons that we use a little more energy when running as opposed to walking (wind resistance, using different muscle groups, etc) but we're essentially using the same amount of fuel.  </p>
<p>We're more tired after running a mile than walking because asking your body to deliver those resources at a higher rate puts a lot of stress on it. Just like your legs become tired due to muscle fatigue, your heart becomes tired due to muscle fatigue too. If you continue to give your heart a workout - just like any other muscle - it will increase in strength and efficiency, allowing it to work harder for longer.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Holy shit, guys. I was using an 8mph jog for the sake of simplifying the mathematics from a 4mph walk! I wasn't suggesting it was a national average! I've enjoyed reading the replies, though.  </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I'm a keen cyclist who cycles 100+ miles a week, can comfortably manage a 20mph cruising speed on good tarmac and I'd class my fitness levels as above average, but certainly not athletic. I <em>can</em> run an 8mph mile, but only one of them! Then again, I don't run regularly and I reckon a reasonably fit casual runner would see a sustained 8mph pace as feasible as my 20mph cycle.  </p>
<p>So there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically a bottleneck on how fast you can get oxygen to your muscles. When you walk, you have a steady and moderate energy need, so the speed that oxygen needs to get to your muscles is one that your body can easily adapt to for long periods of time. When you're running, you need more energy faster, so your body works extra hard to gather enough oxygen and deliver it to your muscles. Your breathing intensifies, your heart pumps faster, and it isn't as easy for your body to handle this type of demand.</p>
<p>Extra bit: the speed at which your muscles need energy also affects that burning muscle soreness you feel when you make a lot of physical effort. Your muscles have two processes to obtain energy from food: a slow, efficient one (aerobic respiration) and a faster, but less efficient one (fermentation). When your muscles need super fast energy, they use the second process, which produces lactic acid as a by-product. That acid is then eventually broken down in the liver, but while it's hj hanging out in your muscles it's what causes the burning soreness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: humans are purpose-built for this question. Bipedalism is more energy efficient than quadrupedalism, but only at slower speeds and over longer periods. Walking is meant to be easy, that's what it's for: saving energy for running, hunting, and fucking.</p>
<p>Follow up fun fact: you can both run and swim faster than a horse, but only over very <em>short</em> distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a lab tech at a lab for exercise physiology so this is kinda my specialty.</p>
<p>Short answer: we don't actually know the cause of fatigue.</p>
<p>We know that it's NOT from your bodies ability to use ATP. Even after people run marathons, their ATP levels in their bodies are virtually the same.</p>
<p>Our best hypotheses is that it's from a build up of waste products from exercise (though we aren't sure which one!) and it's probably not lactic acid.</p>
<p>The faster you run, the more your body burns your energy stores, the faster you build up &quot;waste products&quot; like CO2 and phosphate.</p>
<p>A good hypotheses is that fatigue is caused by the build up of phosphate. When your body breaks down ATP (adenosine TRI-phosphate) for energy, it turns it into ADP (adenosine DI-phosphate) and phosphate. Basically breaks off a phosphate. The phosphate binds to calcium which means it cant be used. Calcium is required for muscle contraction. So less &quot;free&quot; calcium means your muscles cant contract as hard which we interpret as &quot;fatigue&quot;.</p>
<p>Another good hypotheses its a protective mechanism from our brains sending inhibitory feedback signals to our muscles to &quot;get tired&quot; so we don't burn our energy stores and starve to death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
