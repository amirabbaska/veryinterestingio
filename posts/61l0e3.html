		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When studying ethics in psychology at uni I read about &quot;Little Albert&quot;. The short answer to your question is yes, a child can learn a phobia of something not usually thought of as phobia-material.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Albert_experiment</a></p>
<p>In short, they used the techniques of Pavlov with classical and operant conditioning, only Pavlov famously used it on dogs with food. He rang a bell when feeding the dogs so they connected food with the sound of the bell and later they started expecting food as soon as the bell was rung. </p>
<p>Watson and Rayner did the same thing but with a child and fear. It's a good read and very scary thinking about what the lack of clear ethics codes will give.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an American living in Thailand, I can tell you that many people here (and elsewhere around Asia, I presume) eat insects and are scared of cats. I have a very friendly house cat, and I've literally had people leave my condo building because I have a cat and they refuse to walk into my room. It's also true that some Thais are not afraid of insects and eat them regularly. </p>
<p>My own experiences over the last three years of living in Thailand tell me that the answer to your question is YES.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instinctively is already programmed in. They are born that way.</p>
<p>As mammals we react to other mammals is a somewhat positive manner on average, particularly ones with &quot;baby&quot; features.</p>
<p>Most mammals also have an instinctual fear of spiders or snakes. Just watch a cat encounter an unexpected belt if you need evidence. Even if they have never seen a snake before, they are &quot;pre-programmed&quot; to fear or be wary of the shape.</p>
<p>As far as socially conditioning a child to fear other things, and exposing them heavily to others so they do not? Sure you can do that. Cause enough trauma and a person could fear anything. </p>
<p>But it won't be an instinct.</p>
<p>Edit: Scientific backup for spider/snake thing as instictual in humans.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My kids all loved bugs and instinctively pick them up and &quot;awe&quot; at them and find them safe places to hide. I've always reacted that way in front of them and when we see a bug, I talk about how its a baby and its mommy is looking for it, or vice versa. </p>
<p>But not praying mantises. Fuck. That. I hate those terrifying Satan bugs. Makes my skin melt off just seeing one. </p>
<p>Kids don't mind them though, because I'm not a Dingus parent. </p>
<p>Edit: to really answer the question, my kids like bikes and usually think they are cute, but dislike puppies because I dislike puppies. We all like old dogs. </p>
<p>Kids learn by example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  Conditioning is where it's at.</p>
<p>25 years ago in Greece, dogs were considered a nuisance.  There were despised strays everywhere (a massive euthanization prior to the 2004 Olympics ended this).</p>
<p>There was then a public education program to foster positive feelings towards dogs.  They brought dogs into schools, where many kids initially reacted as if you brought in vermin.</p>
<p>The program worked, and the number of dogs kept as pets exploded.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
