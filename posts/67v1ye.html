<p>If you went digital, you'd have to get every single country on Earth to agree to a standard. Sorry, make that every single <em>government</em> on Earth to agree to a standard. We can't even do that between states in the US for drivers licenses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certainly. The stamp will show the entry date to the country to anyone who doesn't have an electronic reader. When I visited Egypt I got a sticker to show I had paid for a visa to allow me to travel outside the tourist areas and the stamp on top showed my entry date. If a police officer or anyone else was to stop me in the street and look at it they could tell instantly if I was legally in the country and if I was where I was supposed to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not all the world is as far into the 21st Century as someone who has the luxury to even ask this question on the internet might thing.</p>
<p>Also, the purpose of the stamps in not be credible or secure.  It is to make it more trouble to fake than to just go through the right process, and to make you commit a serious crime if you do fake it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan uses printed stickers instead of stamps but like it was said earlier, it would be impossible for every country in the world to use digital documentation. Some are too poor for that. I've been to Nicaragua and, sadly, I can't see that country using that kind of technology anytime soon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
