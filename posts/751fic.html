		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is many different types of smoke detectors out there. Some can't see the difference between smoke and steam, but the more complex ones does a good job of separating the two.</p>
<p>The ones I use at work now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>optical. (Think LED in one end of chamber and a photo-resistor in the other end. Mesures the amount of light that get through.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>double optical and thermal. (Uses two different angels on the chamber for the optical part to guesstimate the difference in smoke and steam based on different reflections.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optical / thermal / gas. (Reads Co2. Works like a champ in theaters, clubs etc. that uses theatrical smoke on stage.)</p>
</li>
<li>only thermal. (Works on the principle of fire is hot. Heat rises and sets of the detector at a set temperature or if the temperature is rising very fast.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Double optical is very good at separating steam and smoke. (Use it in kitchens and locker rooms close too the showers. No problem with false alarms.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, I've triggered smoke detectors with steam from the shower before.</p>
<p>The smoke detector works by having a small tube open to the air. At one end of the tube is a radioactive material, at the other is a radiation detector. Smoke gets into the tube and absorbs the radiation, causing the alarm to go off. Steam can certainly do the same thing, but it may be less effective as the steam could absorb less radiation or condense before entering the tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you got the source of steam really close to the detector, it might set it off. The thing with steam is, it dissipates really fast. Much faster than smoke. </p>
<p>By the time steam reaches your ceiling, it’s not enough to block the signal. But smoke, there’s still lots of particles </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are photoelectric and ionization sensors. One checks for flame and one checks for smoke. You have to be car because not all detectors have both. Photoelectric uses infrared light to see of there is smoke in the distance. Ionization sensors have two little plates that sense a break in ion flow, cause by smoldering of a flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smoke is technically a colloid of solid particles in an air medium. That makes it slightly more likely than steam to set off the sensors in a smoke detector, but if you shove a boiling pot of water right up against a detector, you have a small chance of setting it off. </p>
<p>It would be more likely for dust to set it off. For example if you're removing drywall or if the detector is mounted on the wall and you dust it off after a long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
