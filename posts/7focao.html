For example, stable planetary orbits can't exist in more spatial dimensions, and it would be impossible to make predictions with more temporal dimensions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is akin to asking &quot;why does forwards and backwards only have one dimension?&quot;</p>
<p>Time doesn't have one dimension, it is one dimension.</p>
<p>A dimension can be thought of as a Coordinate. To locate something, we need 4 coordinates, where it is in x,y,and z, and when it is.</p>
<p>Time is just another coordinate just like the spacial coordinates (although it is one we struggle to move freely in).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say time HAS one dimension but rather that time IS one dimension. It comes down to the idea that a dimension is simply the required number of measurements needed to define something.</p>
<p>Say we want to describe a car. You might say it's a 4-door, gasoline engine, with 4 seats and the gas cap on the left side. This would mean our car &quot;model&quot; is 4-dimensional, because to define any car in our model uniquely you need four pieces of information (number of doors, type of engine, number of seats, and gas cap location). That doesn't necessarily mean though that a car is a &quot;4-dimensional object&quot; in the way you might use that phrase in a science fiction context. A car doesn't become some trans-dimensional being like a Tralfamadorian just because you use four different &quot;dimensions&quot; to measure it.</p>
<p>Also we could add another dimension to our model, say &quot;color&quot;, to make it 5-dimensional. But, depending on how exactly we define &quot;color&quot; it might take MORE than just one dimension to fully measure color. For example, in many contexts, we define color by measuring the seperate Red, Green, and Blue components together to fully describe a color, which would make color itself 3-dimensional! (And thus, making our full car model 7 (4+3) dimensional) Alternatively, we can measure color using Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black components and have a 4 dimensional color space. It would also be possible to have a 1 dimensional color space if we used something like the hex codes that website stylesheets use to define color (e.g. the color red would be #FF0000, which means a value of FF for the red component, and 00 for the green and blue components, where FF here is the value 256 in hex). So you can see how the data itself as well as our representation can influence the number and type of &quot;dimensions&quot; we need. These dimensions are simply ways of enumerating data.</p>
<p>In our current model of space-time, if you have two events that both occur in the exact same position (measured using 3 dimensions: X, Y, and Z) then the only way to distinguish them is by the time elapsed between them. This number is represented in our system by total seconds elapsed, which is only one number and thus one dimensional. But theoretically, you could also measure it by seconds elapsed, hours elapse, and days elapsed like we do in less formal settings, which would make time 3-dimensional! But really it's still measuring the same, one thing that seperates two events in spacetime, which makes it one-dimensional. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing is, in space, we can freely move around in normal conditions. However with time not only is it one-dimensional, but the arrow of time is also fixed and always moves forward. Why is it so that we can move around in space freely but not time?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Space only feels different because when we're sitting still in 3 space we're still moving through time at full C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
