		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you write a computer program, you write it using a human readable language, for example C, Java or Python. For example, this is what a basic &quot;Hello world&quot; program (a program that print &quot;hello, world&quot;) looks like in C:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}</code></pre>
<p>Things like &quot;include&quot;, &quot;main&quot; and &quot;printf&quot; are instructions for the computer that tell it what to do. The computer, however, doesn't actually know what this code means. Instead, the code first needs to be translated to &quot;machine code&quot;, which the computer does understand, but is very difficult for humans to read and understand. This process is known as &quot;compilation&quot;. When you download a game, the game's executable files are already in machine code, after the compilation process was done. This means that you can't really understand how the game works just by looking at the files. However, if you have the original source code, it means that by looking at it you can figure out how exactly it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over-simplifying it but it's like the difference between a recipe and a cake. </p>
<p>Source Code is the magic ingredients that you put together and then bake (compile) to create a program (executable) that your Operating System (likely Windows) can run. </p>
<p>Now, when you look at a cake you you don't know what it's made of but you know the purpose of a cake and how to use it.
Of course, if you're a baker then you could likely look at a cake and know what goes in it and roughly how it's made but you'd still need the recipe to accurately re-create it.</p>
<p>Same with developers. When you look at a program you can think of all the functions and sub-systems that make it and how you'd go about creating them but you don't know exactly how they were written. </p>
<p>I could go into much deeper explanations on both coding and baking but I hope the above conveys the meaning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think of code as the logic describing what a program should do, then it can be expressed in many different languages. you could describe it informally in English or any other human language (if x is two then do this, otherwise do that. Then do this other thing. Keep doing this until the user presses cancel&quot;).</p>
<p>It can also be expressed in programming languages, which are generally human-readable, looking like a mix of maths and English. For example, the following is a very simple application written in the C++ programming language:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "hello world\n";
}</code></pre>
<p>You could express the same thing in English (write the string &quot;hello world&quot; followed by a line break to the application's standard output. Then set the exit code to zero and terminate&quot;).</p>
<p>But the computer doesn't understand either English or C++. It understands its own language of 0's and 1's. For example, the processor in your PC understands the byte <code>00000100</code> as an &quot;add&quot; instruction. It means &quot;read the byte after this, and add it to the value stored in register &quot;A&quot;.</p>
<p>So what programmers do is they write their code in a programming language such as C++, and then they run it through a compiler, an application which is able to translate code from a programming language to some other language. In this case, the compiler translates the code the programmer wrote into machine code, the language that your processor understands.</p>
<p>In that case, the source code is the code I wrote (the C++ snippet above). And a compiler can translate that into an executable program that my computer can run.</p>
<p>So if someone got hold of the Starcraft source code, as you mention, then they would in principle be able to make changes to the source code, compile it, and get a slightly different version of the game. (I say in principle, because while they could do that, they would be missing all the non-code assets. All the 3d models and textures and scripts and audio files and everything else that makes it a game)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason why people are excited for starcraft source code is, with it we can now make fundamental changes to the code without the limitations of modding (such as making remastered version, adding 4K support), compile it to newer platforms like the latest versions of windows, linux and mac os...etc. </p>
<p>This was exactly what happened very shortly after the source code of starcraft was published.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
