I didn't mean that I was of the opinion that &quot;rare&quot; steak is undercooked (although, relative to a well-done steak, it certainly is). It was definitely a question about the word itself- not what constitutes a &quot;cooked&quot; steak.</p>
<p>Mis-steaks happen.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to /u/CarelessChemicals for a pretty in-depth look at the meaning of the word in this context. Cheers, mate!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's what etymonline has to say about it.  It comes from the Old English word &quot;hrere&quot; which meant lightly cooked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;undercooked,&quot; 1650s, variant of Middle English rere, from Old English hrere &quot;lightly cooked,&quot; probably related to hreran &quot;to stir, move, shake, agitate,&quot; from Proto-Germanic <em>hrorjan (source also of Old Frisian hrera &quot;to stir, move,&quot; Old Saxon hrorian, Dutch roeren, German rühren, Old Norse hroera), from PIE root </em>kere- &quot;to mix, confuse; cook&quot; (source also of Greek kera- &quot;to mix,&quot; krasis &quot;mixture&quot;). Originally of eggs, not recorded in reference to meat until 1784, and according to OED, in this sense &quot;formerly often regarded as an Americanism, although it was current in many English dialects ....&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: since this reply gained some traction, I'll pimp etymonline a bit.  It is a great site for understanding why a particular word has its specific meaning.  Here's the link to rare: <a href="http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=rare" target="_blank">http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=rare</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pathogens we aim to kill with heat are almost exclusively on the surface of the meat. Which is seared to a proper temp even when the middle is &quot;rare&quot;. The type of food born illness that resides in bad meat is not gotten rid of via heat (or any other means). This is why ground beef is inherently more dangerous because once you grind larger pieces of meat you mix in any surface pathogens with the entirety of the product. This is also why my answer is specific to steaks and not burgers. </p>
<p>We have to understand as consumers that food born illness such as e. coli are by in large the result of the contamination of a product from an outside source. This usually means that the surface of a product is ground zero for our attention. Hell, cantaloupes are one of the biggest culprits of salmonella. The pathogen can contaminate the rind of the melon and we we slice into it with a knife we drag salmonella into and across the surface of the pieces of fruit we're going to eat. This is why we wash our produce before consumption (even if it is organic and/or labeled pre-washed). </p>
<p>Source: Am Chef</p>
<p>TL;DR When it comes to getting sick, the surface of a steak is the part that need to be brought up to temperature unless you are dealing with rotted meat, in which case no amount of heat will save you. Wash your vegetables. </p>
<p>Also, please don't wash your chickens in the sink with soap and water. Just thoroughly wash the things that come in contact with the raw product. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know from working in a kitchen for so long aswell, that from fully uncooked to well done the steak loses a third of its mass. Blue to medium retains most of its size and mass. I think everyone else is correct about rere from Germanic roots. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
