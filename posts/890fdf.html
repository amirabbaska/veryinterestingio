</blockquote>
<p>The evolution of nuclear testing is pretty interesting.  Some other people in this thread have great and accurate answers, but I want to provide a little context.  </p>
<p>When the USA tested the first nuclear weapon, scientists weren't exactly sure that it would work as expected.  It was such a major leap in technology that there wasn't consensus on whether or not it would even work, and what the outcome would be.  While it seems silly now, there were well respected, professional physicists who actually briefly discussed the possibility that a nuclear explosion could ignite the atmosphere and end life as we know it.  </p>
<p>This uncertainty was compounded by the fact that the USA (and everyone else) couldn't produce material fast enough to have a lot of bombs to test.  We basically had one shot to test it before it was weaponized.  During that test, the actual explosion was nearly twice as large as the highest expectations.  Even with a huge team of top scientists working on calculations, the bomb ended up being more impactful than estimated.  </p>
<p>So picture yourself as a scientist or war planner during this period.  You would be on the cutting edge of science, and you have to figure out theoretical predictions for a very real and untested technology.  Meanwhile your country is engaged in a bloody war against brutal enemies.  Sure you pay attention to some of the negative consequences of testing the bomb, but your primary focus would be on learning as much as you can... that means doing testing.  Without real data points, it's hard to figure out all of the negative consequences.  </p>
<p>So the US did tests.  For the first few years, it was just fission bombs.  Though powerful, they were nothing compared to the thermonuclear bombs that succeeded them.  Compared to thermonuclear bombs, they had much less explosive power, less radiation, and a far smaller fireball radius. You could explode them in a desert, and things would be fine. </p>
<p>In the 1950s, much progress was made on thermonuclear (fusion) weapons.  These were orders of magnitude more destructive than what was previously known.  With the advent of thermonuclear bombs, nations quickly realized that their standard test practices might not adequately contain these bombs.  </p>
<p>That shift in understanding was best exemplified in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo" target="_blank">Castle Bravo</a> test in 1954.  During that test, the explosion was a full 2.5 times larger than expected.  Though the US military had blocked off an area around the test site to prevent harm to people, the larger-than-expected event ended up harming and killing members of the US Navy and civilian fishermen near the blast site.  </p>
<p>While above ground testing continued for a few years, the Castle Bravo event started to focus attention on how truly dangerous nuclear weapons in general and weapons testing in particular could be.  Because the blast hurt non-American citizens, it opened the eyes to other world leaders that US and USSR weapons testing actually threatened people who had nothing to do with nuclear weapons.  There was global outrage, and a growing push to reign in on weapons testing.  </p>
<p>So in 1963, the US, USSR, and UK (the only other nuclear power at the time) agreed to a ban on testing anywhere other than below ground (the partial test ban treaty).  By moving the testing below ground, the countries doing the testing could contain radioactive fallout.  </p>
<p>It's important to understand that the PTBT couldn't have come at a better time.  Prior to the test ban treaty, Nikita Khrushchev seemed determined to assert his posture by testing larger and larger yield weapons.  Six of the top 10 largest bombs ever designed were tested in the year prior to the PTBT.  It's reasonable to conclude that had that trend continued, there would have been more consequences as a result of above ground testing (it's also worth noting that the US had been testing dozens of bombs per month).    </p>
<p>All told, only about 600 of the 2,400 nuclear weapons tests happened before testing was moved underground.  </p>
<hr />
<p>As others have mentioned, the testing was both spread out and happened in areas where there wouldn't be massive fires.  For context on the fires, it's been speculated that fires would kill more people than an actual blast if a thermonuclear bomb was detonated in a city.  A modern thermonuclear bomb would instantly ignite every flammable object within a several mile radius, blotting out the skies with smoke.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Another interesting thing to know is that the concept of nuclear winter wasn't really widely accepted until the 1980s. So as people were testing weapons in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, they didn't realize (at least with any scientific accuracy) how bad nuclear winter could be.  </p>
<p>Prior to the 1980s, people were afraid of the blast and the fallout.  After a series of studies came out in the 1980s, people learned that even if you survived the blast and weren't subject to fallout, you'd still probably die because the skies would be darkened and the food supply would dry up. </p>
<p>Had they known about nuclear winter in the 1940s/50s/60s, it's reasonable to conclude that tests may have been moved underground sooner.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>•    prohibited nuclear weapons tests or other nuclear explosions under water, in the atmosphere, or in outer space</p>
<p>•    allowed underground nuclear tests as long as no radioactive debris falls outside the boundaries of the nation conducting the test</p>
<p>•    pledged signatories to work towards complete disarmament, an end to the armaments race, and an end to the contamination of the environment by radioactive substances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While nuclear weapons are very dangerous, the US and other nuclear powers haven't tested any weapons in 20 years. Civilized countries are working to get a comprehensive nuclear test ban, but there are a few rogue countries that are still testing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radiation from above ground nuclear tests is everywhere, you can't use carbon dating on anything more recent than 1945 because of nuclear contamination, but it hasn't ruined life on Earth.  <a href="http://fpif.org/global-nuclear-winter-avoiding-unthinkable-india-pakistan/" target="_blank">However, a regional nuclear war between Pakistan and India could cause a nuclear winter, ruining global food production for a year.</a>  This is because the nuclear tests in the 1950 were out in the desert, the ocean, or the treeless tundra of northern Siberia.  A &quot;small&quot; nuclear war would <em>burn cities</em>, generating huge amounts of smoke.  </p>
<p>If 100 nuclear bombs go off in the desert, there would be a little extra radiation and life would go on.  If 100 cities get vaporized, the smoke would block the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small amount of nukes does not render the earth in serious danger. They are also tested in remote places often underground thus limiting the amount of exposure that people and crops have to it. </p>
<p>The threat of destruction from nuclear war is the threat of nukes taking out dozens if not hundreds of cities at one time, not a few bombs being detonated in protected and remote test areas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
