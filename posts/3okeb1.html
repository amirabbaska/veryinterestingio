		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lowercase 'a' in most (but not all) computer fonts looks like that because it's also the way the letter looks in most typefaces used in printing. So we have to go quite a long way back to examine why that glyph looks different from how you write 'a' by hand.</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that it's basically a historical accident: there were loads of variations of the letter 'a' and one became standard in printing while a less fancy one became standard in handwriting, presumably because people are lazy when they have to do things by hand.</p>
<p>So, there were actually many different ways of writing the letter if you go back around 1500 years ago. This is actually not that uncommon - if you think about other letters like 'g' that today have variants, or you might have heard of the old english letter thorn (þ) coming to be written like a 'y' (hence 'ye olde shoppe').</p>
<p>Anyway, after a while there were two main variants, one which was like the handwritten a, and one which was similar, but where the upright line on the right is diagonal, and extends above the loop. This bit that stretches up will eventually become the bit that loops over and left that we see now on our computer screens. These two characters also make clear the connection with the modern upper case A - there is a form between the two, formed of two diagonal lines (like an A) and a connecting stroke at the bottom.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule" target="_blank">Caroline Script</a> was used for writing books and became more or less standard over Western Europe, and used the script-a form. In the meantime, the single story a remained widely used in other handwriting.</p>
<p>This type of script fell out of use but was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by Italian scribes who thought they were looking at classical Roman lower case letters. This script then became widely used, and was used in the printing presses of Venice in the 15th century. Since then it has been quite standard. Of course, digital typefaces followed on from the physical ones, which brings us (sort of) to the answer: because of history.</p>
<p>You can find a lot of information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Western_typography" target="_blank">here</a> and there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_script#/media/File:Evolution_of_minuscule.svg" target="_blank">cool graphic of lots of different script families</a> as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly because of old printing presses with handset type. The lettering used on old presses could become worn, making that a look like an o, or vice versa. By using the a we know in common typefaces today readers could easily distinguish between an actual a and a worn o.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a 5 year old son who is currently in Kindergarten. We asked his teacher this very same question, because his homework would come home with both a's represented at different times. Her response was that they are ok with the kids writing their a's either way, but they need to be able to recognize the 'a' in type since we are moving to an ever-increasingly technological society.</p>
<p>In the end, I was more confused over it than my 5-year old. He seems to have adapted well and can read/write his a's either way (although he, like almost everyone else, prefers to write the more traditionally handwritten 'α'.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because its easier to tell the difference between 'α' and 'a' when you're reading quickly. The best font or typeface is drawn to be the easiest to read. Each letter should be unique enough that you can easily tell the difference at a quick glance. </p>
<p>You might also notice that 'a' probably looks more like an 'A' than 'α' does. The lowercase 'a' evolved more closerly from 'A'. The original lowercase developed because humanity switched from inscribing in stone to writing on page. 'α' was later developed from writing in script and cursive. You still might see calligraphers use 'a' but most folks have adopted 'α' in their writing now a days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
