<p>The earth has 29.92 inches of HG at &quot;sea level.&quot; It depends on pressure. When pressure varies from 29.92 then it can be at, above or below</p>
<p>On Mars, they chose 610.5 Pascals as &quot;sea level.&quot; 29.92in/hg = 101320.75 Pascals for reference.</p>
<p>Then they use scientific instruments from orbiting satellites to measure the height or depth in relation to that frame of reference.</p>
<p>Zero elevation on the Moon is just average diameter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Novice mountaineer here. I'll try my best to answer this with what I've been learning over the last couple years of climbing.</p>
<p>Mountain summits are measured, as far as I know, in 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Elevation</strong>: Which is simply the height of the summit above sea level. Since you asked about a planet without seas, it's important to note that this is based on a <em>geodetic</em> sea level. I'm pretty sure this can be applied regardless of the existence of actual water, since it sort of defines where a sea level would be. I'm not a geologist, so that part might require clarification from someone experienced in geology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prominence</strong>: aka <em>topographic prominence</em>, is the height of the summit compared to its surroundings. Simply put, this is a measure how much higher the summit of a mountain is compared to other mountains/hills in the area. This is a big one for mountaineers because it gives a certain significance to reaching the summit, and it's sure to offer amazing views once you get there.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: This is a measurement of how far the summit lies from the closest landmass with equal elevation. This is very similar to prominence, but if a given mountain has a high <em>radius of dominance</em>, it means that it could be the highest point in the region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I'm only a novice, and I'm sure there may be a more qualified answer coming along. But I hope this helps to shed some light on the subject until that time comes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The earth!</p>
<p>Ironically even though it doesn't seem that way from our perspective, if you look at the earth as an alien in a spaceship would it is very easy to figure out how much the groves and ridges differ from the norm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
