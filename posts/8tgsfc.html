<p>Or another example, the galaxy that we’re in is 100,000 light years wide or something like that. How do we possibly know that?</p>
<p>And i guess i also have a related question but how can telescopes see so much to begin with ?</p>
<p>My mind can’t wrap around the understanding of how we’re able to observe space lol, it’s so daunting how small we are.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several methods to calculate the distance of a celestial body. Which one is used depends on the exact circumstance. Here are some of the most important methods:</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallax</strong>: Earth orbits the sun. In the process of this orbit, we change our position in space relative to a celestial body (just like you see a nearby tree in a different position if you move 10 steps to one side) Using trigonometry, we can calculate the distance to the celestial body in question. 
<ul>
<li>Advantages: very precise for close objects, no complicated instruments needed. </li>
<li>Disadvantage: only possible for close objects </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectral emission</strong>: Stars emit photons with specific wavelengths based on the material they are fusing in their core. We can identify the composition of a star by analyzing those photons.  Due to the expansion of space, however, the wavelengths of photons emitted very far away get redshifted. That means, their wavelengths get longer the further they travel. By comparing the wavelengths of the photons we <em>measure</em> to the wavelengths the photons <em>should have</em> we can calculate the distance those photons traveled. And thus the distance to the celestial body. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advantage: Possible over longer distances</p>
</li>
<li>Disadvantage: The object has to be bright enough so we can measure spectral lines reliably </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standard candles</strong>: Standard candles are celestial bodies of known luminosity (~brightness). We know this luminosity due to the characteristics of some bodies (special types of super novae etc.) By comparing the absolute brightness to the apparent brightness (the brightness the object has vs the brightness we see from the distance) we can calculate the distance to the standard candle. By identifying standard candles in distant galaxies and nebulae, we can infer the distance of those structures. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advantage: Possible over long distances</p>
</li>
<li>Disadvantage: We need to find standard candles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to measure distances, suitable for different distance scales with the uncertainty increasing with distance. You can distinguish between two types of measurements: direct distance measurement and inference due to observed and true luminosity. The first kind is only suitable for close objects and is usually done with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax" target="_blank">parallax method</a>. In ELI5 terms: look at your thumb with first the left eye and then the red eye closed. You can see the thumb 'jumping' from left to right. Repeat while you change the distance
of your thumb to your face and you notice that the thumb jumps much further if you hold it close to your face.<br />
To infer the distance to a star involves literally the same geometry, so in our example you observe a star today and then again in six months. As the earth moves halfway around the sun this is like observing once through the left and once the right eye. Knowing how far the earth is away from the sun and measuring how far the star 'jumps' between the two measurements we can infer the distance of the star (it's like measuring the distance between your eyes and how far the thumb 'jumps' to infer the length of your arm).  </p>
<p>The other methods usually boil down to knowing how bright an object should be and measuring how bright it appears on earth. Imagine a 100 W light bulb, from half a meter away you can't look into it without hurting your eyes, and at 10 km distance you would barely notice it. The apparent luminosity will drop with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a> meaning that if you know the true luminosity you can measure the apparent luminosity with a photo cell and can infer the distance with those two values. </p>
<p>This leads to the question of how do we know how bright a star or an object should be? This post is already getting quite long, and let's just say that there are a lot of regularities out there that we can use and all these methods depend on each other to be gauged, which is why we call it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder" target="_blank">cosmic distance ladder</a> meaning if tomorrow we find out that the distance to the first rung is off all other distances need to be corrected as well. Often they are just expressed in terms of each other, e.g. we say something is a certain numbers of AU away, with AU being the astronomical unit which stands for the distance between the earth and the sun. Or instead of in lightyears (which would be a real distance measure) we use (the infamous) parsec which to the best of our knowledge is equal to 3.26 light years, but like I said this measurement might be corrected in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways, from using radar to comparing the objects to other objects nearby with a known radius. For supernovae and nebulae there's also the option of measuring the overall distance traveled from the center. If we know, for example, how the star that collapsed into a supernova was composed and how big it was, it's possible to calculate how fast the particles from that supernova travel across space.</p>
<p>The reason why telescopes see so much more than we can is because of their huge size. They're able to collect so much more light and radiation than other methods. Space telescopes are even better at this because they don't have our atmosphere blocking some light out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
