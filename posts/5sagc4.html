		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your taste buds are actually quite limited in detecting taste. If you've ever tried putting lemon juice on your tongue when it's sticking out, you likely can't taste it. The roof of your mouth pressing the food down onto the chemoreceptors on your tongue does more of the work, but the olfactory receptors are unique and can give a more &quot;3D&quot; experience. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I believe ~90% of taste comes from smell. This is also why you can &quot;almost taste something&quot; when you smell it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everyone's answer about smell being 90% of &quot;taste&quot;, try watching coffee/wine tasters.</p>
<p>Everytime they take a gulp, they look like they are <strong>rinsing the sample</strong> through their teeth, before spitting it out and rinsing a &quot;reset&quot; cup of water/solution.</p>
<p>The fact is they are swishing and aerating the sample by bobbing the back of their tongue up and down, <em>at the same time</em>, the action <strong>forces some air from the throat into the back of their nose</strong> to taste-smell the sample.</p>
<p>(They aren't gargling/rinsing through their teeth like how you would after brushing your teeth. That rinsing action requires you to block off your throat, which wouldn't help very much in trying to test aroma of beverages. Imagine trying to rinse, but you tense your cheeks and also allow the air to move in and out of your throat instead of blocking it off. That is kind of what they do.)</p>
<p>When your nose is congested, the fragrant air from the throat(which came from the mouth) <strong>cannot reach the smelling parts of the nose</strong>, so much of the aroma and fragrance from your food is lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually only have 5 tastes, sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami. Everything else is a flavor like strawberry or vanilla these are &quot;tasted&quot; through smell although sight and even how you think about the food plays a large part in the flavor as well. (Source: mom is a chef who specializes in food and wine pairing amongst other things and has studied the science of taste extensively) if you have any questions feel free to ask alot of this was hammered into my head from a pretty young age although I'm a little rusty now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
