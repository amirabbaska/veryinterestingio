<p>Jupiter is not nearly heavy enough to sustain a fusion reaction. Fusion only takes place under extreme circumstances (temperature, pressure). It happens in stars, because they are so big that their own gravity compresses the core sufficiently to create these circumstances. Detonating a bomb on/in Jupiter won't do anything to change its mass or density.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hydrogen fusion isn't a chain reaction process in the way that nuclear fission is. Nuclear fission (as used by humans anyway) relies on energetic neutrons striking the atoms of the fissionable material (e.g. uranium), causing it to break apart and emit more energetic neutrons, which will cause fission in other atoms, etc... a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Hydrogen fusion doesn't need an external input, such as neutrons, like fission does. Simply crank up the temperature and pressure of a hydrogen gas and eventually fusion will take place. This means that starting the process isn't a matter of &quot;kickstarting&quot; it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn't work that way.  You're assuming an analogy of putting a match to kindling - put the two together and the whole thing goes up.  In reality, if Jupiter had sufficient mass to become a star, it would just self ignite due to the pressure in its core.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, Jupiter is something like two orders of magnitude too small to become a star.  In the big picture astrophysics, two orders of magnitude is really close.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These answers have been pretty comprehensive so far, but I wanted to clear up the question of &quot;what if I detonated a nuclear bomb in Jupiter's core?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Jupiter's core will for a brief moment, be very hot and under some serious pressure, so there may be some fusion taking place for an instant, but eventually the planet will return to its original state because there's not enough heat and pressure at the core to maintain that. The core would then be a little bit radioactive and have a little more helium, but the planet would for the most part be the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The climax of &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke was dropping millions of monoliths into Jupiter to increase the mass and pressure enough to start fusion and create a new sun. It would be a minor star, but big enough to warm Europa enough to accelerate the evolution of the fledgling life in it's oceans. Cool idea, good book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
