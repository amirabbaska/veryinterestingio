		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).</p>
<p>Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.</p>
<p>Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.</p>
<p>So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.</p>
<p>Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.</p>
<p>So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?</p>
<p>Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.</p>
<p>The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.</p>
<p>Does that kinda summ it up?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geochemist here, not geophysicist, but... remember that with the core, you have to consider pressure as well. Also, seismic studies have long shown that the outer core is liquid. Recently they showed that it spins at a different rate than the solid inner core. The spinning generates the magnetic field. It's a Dynamo, not a bar magnet. Good explanation: <a href="http://www.geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/mag_fld/fld-en.php" target="_blank">http://www.geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/mag_fld/fld-en.php</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iron loses its <em>ferromagnetic</em> properties at 1043 K (1400 F). That's the Curie Temperature, where the heat jiggles the magnetism about harder than the exchange, anisotropy, and demagnetizing fields can keep it in place. That doesn't mean it's non-magnetic, it can still be paramagnetic.</p>
<p>As for the earth's core, the other posters here are spot on. The core is spinning, and that spinning means charges are being spun, which looks just like an electromagnet. And although the magnetic field does need to travel through the rest of the earth, and other magnetic materials on its way to the surface, the field it produces it <em>huge</em>. Much weaker than if the core was a uniformly magnetised permanent magnet, but it is still an enormous electromagnet.</p>
<p>As for the moon, the core isn't hot enough or large enough to convect. So, it doesn't spin. So, it doesn't produce an electromagnetic effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few misconceptions in your post, to begin with. </p>
<p>Firstly, the inner core isn't in the plasma phase—it's thought to be <em>solid</em>, surrounded by a sphere of <em>iron-rich fluid</em> (probably liquid, to be precise), according to <a href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~glatz/geodynamo.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. At the centre of the Earth, the pressure is too high (on the order of 10^10 – 10^11 Pa), and temperature too low (4000 – 5000 K) for iron to become plasma. </p>
<p>Next, nickel is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">most definitely ferromagnetic</a>, i.e. a piece of nickel will stick to a magnet if you put one near the former. </p>
<p>The geodynamo which generates the terrestrial magnetic field arises due to a combination of convective currents, the Coriolis effect from the Earth's rotation, the slowly growing inner core as the inner Earth cools, and the direct heating effect from the inner core (which in turn arises due to energy from gravitational collapse and radioactive decay of unstable isotopes, especially potassium-40). The fluid in the outer core moves in cylindrical rolls due to all this. </p>
<p>The fact that the fluid contains electrons (it is a molten metal alloy, after all), and is already moving in a magnetic field, means that a circular electrical current is induced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Faraday's Law</a>. Moving electrons = moving charge = electric current in the opposite direction of electron movement. The circular electric currents in turn generate their own B-fields, or magnetic field. Electric currents in a circle or in a solenoid generate a dipole magnetic field, which is what the Earth's magnetic field is, for the most part. </p>
<p>An interesting note is that simulations of the Earth's magnetic field even manage to account for the cycle of magnetic pole reversals.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the overall field is powered by the residual kinetic and thermal energy in the Earth's interior. The order of energy conversion makes this simpler to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thermal energy from the inner core → kinetic energy in convecting fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinetic energy of fluid outer core → (should technically be an equals symbol, because electrical energy is due to kinetic energy anyway) electrical energy of fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electric energy of fluid outer core → magnetic energy of fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinetic energy of fluid outer core <em>in</em> magnetic field generated in <strong>3.</strong> → more electrical energy of fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>Repeat 3. and 4. recursively.  </li>
</ol>

All of the above and my other replies below is merely an application of what I've learnt in the Singapore GCE 'A' Level physics and chemistry syllabuses.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is an electromagnet, as are all bodies in outer space that have a significant magnetic field. Electromagnets are generally weaker than ferromagnets per unit mass (which is why your plasma arc probably didn't have a strong magnetic field), but the Earth has a huge amount of mass. </p>
<p>The moon has no magnetic field because it has almost no metal inside it.</p>
<p>Since electromagnetism is a force with infinite range, it shouldn't be surprising that swirling in the Earth's core can produce an effect reaching the surface. In any case, the outer liquid core isn't that much smaller than the while Earth (its radius is around 2000 km, 1/3 of the Earth's radius) - so a large-scale current would produce a surface magnetic field only 3^(3)=27 times smaller than the field in the core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
