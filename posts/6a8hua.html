		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aviary expert here. Birds can tell the sensation of creatures moving beneath their feet. Earth is one of the best conduits of movement, so the vibrations of animals such as worms can be felt through their claws and talons, travelling through their legs and into their bones, eventually vibrating into their skulls. This sensation allows them to pinpoint the movement of any animal, so they can then aim their beaks to strike at the exact moment any creature comes closest to the surface.</p>
<p>TLDR: Yes birds know what they're doing, it's not down to chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an experiment Birds were placed in aviaries where they could be given buried mealworms in trays of dirt.</p>
<p>To test if they were using scent to locate their prey, birds were offered trays with buried live, moving worms and dead ones. Robins found the live worms more often, suggesting they were not using scent.</p>
<p>In the next test, they were given hanging food trays to keep them from touching the soil with their feet and detecting the wormâ€™s vibrations. The trays did not affect their ability to find the worms, suggesting they do not use tactile cues.</p>
<p>When cardboard was used as a barrier to block visual cues, the birds could still find the worms. That meant they were using another sense. A last experiment used white noise to block sound cues and the birds had more difficulty finding the worms.</p>
<p>The research concluded that robins could use either visual or auditory cues alone, but probably use both.
I think this is also likely true for Starlings/Blackbirds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
