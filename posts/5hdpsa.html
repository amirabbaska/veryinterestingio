		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scent is being able to detect particles in the air/water. The closer you are to the source of the smell the higher the density of particles, thus it's easy to smell, but as you get further away the particles become diluted and less dense in the air/water. Sharks have a very sensitive olfactory (scent) system that can detect these stray blood particles in extremely dilute circumstances thus they can smell it further away.</p>
<p>Think about a dogs sense of smell, many times over our power of smell and so they can follow the trail of a person for miles by following the skin particles that fall off us, sometimes weeks after that person had been there and the particles have been spread and lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool Love sharks, here we go:</p>
<p>So as others have stated sharks do have a great sense of smell and can detect very small amounts of blood in the water, talking a few parts per billion.  This is specifically for blood to help them find dying prey.  Humans have a few things we can smell in a few parts per billion, skunks being a good example.  </p>
<p>Sharks do have a powerful sense of smell but sound is the main way they detect things from very, very far away.  Sharks have incredible hearing and can detect the sound a struggling fish makes.  After sound and smell there eyesight (this can vary in species) is actually pretty good as well.  As they get closer to their prey they will then use some senses we don't have.  They have a center line with a mucous filled membrane (similar to our ears) with fine hairs to detect vibrations in the water (many fish have this and its how fish school). Once they are even closer to their prey they use the Ampullae of Lorenzini to detect electrical impulses from a few feet away and this give them the ability to sense their preys heartbeat and the difference between, alive, dying, dead. </p>
<p>Also their skin is made of something called dermal denticles that allows them to be at full speed and not create turbulence in the water and &quot;sneak&quot;. Not sure on this one but I also think they can absorb tastes(smell) through their skin.</p>
<p>So basically a shark is a perfect hunter and uses all of its senses to hunt effectively.  Its sense of smell is always the go to fact of sharks but their sense of sound and other sense are incredible too.  </p>
<p>Cool fact to not try:  You can go down about 25 ft at a reef and crackle a disposable water bottle like an ice mountain and it will mimic a dying fish.  I got about 3 8 ft reef sharks to the exact position i made the noise with a bottle. Kinda scary but it works and was awesome.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smelling is a shark's primary sense. Their nostrils are on the outside of their body, and they only use them for smelling not breathing. Water continuously flows through a sharks nostrils interacting with highly sensitive membranes that feed information to the shark's brain. This information allows a shark to pinpoint the source of blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>sharks have several adaptations to their environment to help with hunting. While their nose is highly developed they also have other sense systems, the ampullae of lorenzini and the lateral line.  </p>
<p>The nose<br />
diffusion of chemicals in a liquid media is only so fast, and that will limit the influence of smell in sharks hunter much more than is realized. While their olfaction sense may be extremely sensitive, it is responding to slowly traveling chemicals. olfaction depends on diffusion of the particles / molecules to be sensed, and also having detectors that recognize them. General physics and chemistry knowledge is that diffusion depends on the density of the media and its interaction with the molecules in it. diffusion rates in general are: solid &lt; liquid &lt; gas. so we, living in a gas-phase environment, have a big advantage over sharks in the speed with which chemicals reach our nose from their source. The sharks compensation for this, is to have amazingly sensitive noses. They are extremely sensitive, but are sensing something that took more time to reach them. But they can't overcome the physical properties of what they are sensing. so they have other adaptations.     </p>
<p>ampullae of lorenzini<br />
sharks have ampullae sensitive to electrical signals which travel extremely quickly in salt water. these ampullae are connected to nerves under their skin over much of their body, and the ampullae are in great concentration near their mouth. prey can be hunted without practically any light or olfactory input using these and the  </p>
<p>lateral line<br />
another set of ampullae near the head sensitive to changes in pressure and currents  </p>
