		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with other proteins,ELASTIN in your skin is the main component keeping your skin (you guessed it elastic) and its existence depends on 2 things. The rate at which you synthesize elastin and the rate at which the enzymes that break it down do so, this balance can be disturbed by decreasing synthetic function or increasing breakdown and is affected by different factors.. </p>
<ol>
<li>age: younger cells are better at making things than older cells due to factors like oxidative stress and accumulation of mutations over time. </li>
<li>Nutritional status: you need to have enough of the necessary ingredients to make elastin</li>
<li>Exercise: our bodies respond well to stimuli that tell it to work, exercise keeps your synthetic function going as you replace damaged muscle fibers and your body stays on top of its synthetic function as it has a constant stimulus to do so.  </li>
<li>Stress: being under a lot of stress induces release of cortisol, the stress response hormone, one of the well known effects of high levels of circulating cortisol is skin atrophy aka getting thin bad skin due to decreased synthesis of all the proteins in your skin (elastin and co.)</li>
<li>UV radiation; this bad boy damages the skin cells that carry out that synthetic function, so keeping you skin protected is a way to preserve these cells, this is why some people that apply daily sunscreen to their faces look way younger for their age. UV leads to decreased elastin synthesis. </li>
<li>Smoking : terrible one right here, this bad boy directly damages proteins that slow down the rate at which you break down elastin, so if you damage the thing stopping the breakdown of the good stuff (elastin) then you break down more elastin and you’re left with once again.. less elastin</li>
<li>There’s other factors but i need to stop writing eventually so i don’t bore everyone to death. But i hope these helped. </li>
</ol>
<p>In a nutshell, as with most other things, eat well, exercise, don’t smoke, stay stress free ! </p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>Edit: structure, grammar, spelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stretch marks aren't from growth but from growing faster than your skin can grown new cells. Babies grow slowly and steadily so their skin grows new cells to cover the growth. In events like pregnancy, teenage growth spurts, putting on weight, your skin can't make cells fast enough and instead has to fill in with scar tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A babies skin is much more elastic than a 20 year old persons, and the 20 year old's skin is much more elastic than a 40 years olds, and so on and so on.  Sort of think about it like a rubber ball.  When it's new, it's super bouncy, as it gets used and abused it starts to lose it's bounce, and after that it eventually begins to break down and crack.  The skin is similar.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously you haven't met my little brother because he has stretch marks from growing up. He had a disorder though, his skeleton was growing faster than it should. In general to answer your question no they don't because the cells of the skin and organs and bone structure and everything is multiplying and growing at the same time whereas with pregnancy you do get stretch marks because the baby grows inside the woman's belly so quickly and stretches the skin because the pregnant woman is not producing more skin cells, just stretching esisting ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
