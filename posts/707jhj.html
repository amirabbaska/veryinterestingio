The reason behind my question is that it seems really easy to say, &quot;oh snap I guess you are right and I'm wrong&quot;, which is apparently hard for people to do. This is true for me in pretty much everything. I just was wondering why it is difficult for others to do. Lots of good reasons here though!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends one what level of belief you mean. If we are just talking about a simple belief like trivia, our resistance to accepting that we're wrong is likely due to reputation. That is, if we are shown to be wrong about something, the implication is that we are not reliable.</p>
<p>Think of it in evolutionary terms. Much of our pre-history involves developing trust between people. An untrustworthy person could steal from you, kill you, or otherwise use you for their gain and turn on you when convenient. Earning and demonstrating trustworthiness as a reputation would have been important to survival. Those who proved untrustworthy, such as liars, could be punished, killed, expelled from the tribe, or even just ostracized and not selected as a mate. All these mean they were less likely to survive and reproduce. Those predisposed to fearing being judges as unreliable, and who instinctively acted to protect their reputation, would have reproduced more to pass on their genes.</p>
<p>This is why &quot;saving face&quot; is so important to both individuals and cultures, especially historically. People would kill others who questioned their honesty and integrity: duels, honor killings, and so forth. Even the parts of culture where challenging somebody's claims or confronting people is considered impolite is built on this notion of protecting reputation. </p>
<p>So changing belief is an admission that you were wrong and that your claims are unreliable. Sometimes that instinct can be far too strong in some people, unwilling to admit to any mistakes. It may depend on whether you are alone in the belief and everyone is against you, in which case maintaining your position risks lowering your status in the group, or if you have a &quot;tribe&quot; of believers backing you up and defending the belief <em>raises</em> your status with them.</p>
<p>If we're talking about a fundamental belief like a god, political basis, or the nature of how things work, and a whole collection of other beliefs derive from it, all of the above is still true but there is a complicating factor. Now accepting that you are wrong means much of your world view is all wrong and needs to be re-built from scratch. That can actually be very disorienting to deal with. We often call this effect, &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; when we realize our beliefs are inconsistent and feel disoriented and confused about it.</p>
<p>You can think about belief systems as a &quot;locally&quot; consistent collection of beliefs. Like if you have. A religious belief in a god and you understand how people, society, behaviours, history, nature, and so on all derive from that. If you then challenge that this god exists, none of your other beliefs make sense. You now don't understand anything you thought you did. Your have to re-learn why people act the way they do, how the world works, how you should behave, etc.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to just dismiss minor challenges to core beliefs, and use your larger understanding as protection against challenging it. You also have a whole social network that believes the same things so you feel comfortable maintaining the belief. Challenging it just does you no good in any practical social terms, and causes great cognitive and social harms to you. You won't <em>want</em> to challenge it, and even be scared of that. </p>
<p>But, we all have these inner thoughts and may lead you to question core beliefs, perhaps driven by outside information or because you want to come up with good answers to fight back against a challenger and discover there are no good answers. You then have problems to deal with, like all derivative beliefs and what to do about your life being tied up into this belief system: friends, family, job, culture, etc. Clergy who lose faith have a real life decision to make as they have to start life over, including job skills.</p>
<p>Political parties can act like religions too. They start to take on collections of dogma, and challenging those beliefs makes you a traitor to the tribe, and your social circle and position in it will suffer, especially if you are a politician who has a similar dilemma as clergy.</p>
<p>Sometimes life is much, much easier to refuse challenging your beliefs. The exception is, of course, when you have a social culture where challenging beliefs is rewarded and praised, like science. That is hard to instill in people though, largely because it goes against our tribalist instincts. It's a lot of hard work to have social value in a culture where challenging beliefs is rewarded, as that takes a lot of education, thought, and intellectual prowess. A culture of defending beliefs is easier because all you have to do is repeat them and become aggressive or violent against challengers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, something I'm semi-qualified to answer!  This is right in my field of research at the moment.  There's a HUGE number of explanations for this so I'll just list the biggest reasons that immediately come to mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Confirmation bias: people have a tendency not only to seek out, but to better remember information that is in line with their beliefs.  It feels good being proven right, and so more often than not when debating an issue, we search up evidence that will support our point, rather than actively seeking to disprove ourselves.  Even when we come across information that goes against our beliefs, we better remember information that supports our beliefs after the fact.  E.g. for someone who doesn't believe in the human-caused climate change theory, they will much more easily and readily recall the studies and things they found online that disconfirm climate change, than the studies that support.  In this regard, to many people your ELI5 alludes to, the things that you would suggest disprove their beliefs must seem few and far between compared to evidence supporting their beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naive realism: is an effect whose three tenets state (1) we believe we see the world objectively (2) we expect others to come to the same conclusion so long as they're rational and exposed to the same information (3) we assume that anyone who does not come to the same conclusion my be either biased, ignorant, or irrational.  Basically, we take the huge assumption that the world is objectively how we see it (it'd be pretty hard to live life otherwise, always doubting your own perceptions of everything from temperature, to social etiquette, to valid science.)  E.g. it's alot easier for someone who doesn't believe in the human-caused climate change theory who already takes in selective media through the websites they visit, and news they watch (as affected by the confirmation bias), to think that people who present a different point of view are ignorant or irrational, than to adopt a new belief.</p>
</li>
<li>Rather than taking someone else's viewpoint as a distinct viewpoint, in discussion settings, individuals with differing beliefs tend to view the other side as attacking their beliefs, while they believe they are objectively presenting their beliefs.  Both sides think this, and as a result discussions like this often don't get anywhere.  This also ties in with what's referred to as the conflict spiral.  Since both people feel attacked, in a debate/discussion with differing beliefs, people tend to present their opinion more certainly and more strongly than what they actually believe.  E.g. if someone who doesn't believe in the human-caused climate change theory is feeling attacked and backed into a corner in a debate, it wouldn't make much sense for them to express the mixed messages and merits of both sides of the issue, even if they believe there is a few good arguments on the other side and even if they're only like 85% certain of their view.  They want to &quot;win&quot; this argument so they portray themselves as being absolutely without doubt, and the climate change believers and having no merit in their argument whatsoever.  Both sides engage in this, and rather than conversing to understand each other's view, they try to convince each other with increasing argument extremity, and get increasingly frustrated when this doesn't work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Source: I'm a final year undergraduate honours psychology student conducting research in political psychology attempting to reduce falsely perceived adversary viewpoint extremity (known as the false polarization effect) through perceiving the adversary as an intelligent friend.</p>
<p>If anyone's interested I could post some relevant studies, but I'm too busy to look them up at the immediate moment.  Confirmation Bias, and Naive Realism should be pretty easy to look up online.  The conflict Spiral and study on people's perceptions of others in debates is more recent research and could be a little harder to find.  Hope this helps explain!</p>
<p>edit 1: changed some unintentionally biased wording (changed &quot;denier&quot; to &quot;someone who doesn't believe in human-caused climate change theory&quot; (we all fall prey to biases!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/" target="_blank">The Backfire Effect</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Misconception:</strong> When your beliefs are challenged with facts, you alter your opinions and incorporate the new information into your thinking.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best paragraph from that which summarizes the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once something is added to your collection of beliefs, you protect it from harm. You do it instinctively and unconsciously when confronted with attitude-inconsistent information. Just as confirmation bias shields you when you actively seek information, the backfire effect defends you when the information seeks you, when it blindsides you. Coming or going, you stick to your beliefs instead of questioning them. When someone tries to correct you, tries to dilute your misconceptions, it backfires and strengthens them instead. Over time, the backfire effect helps make you less skeptical of those things which allow you to continue seeing your beliefs and attitudes as true and proper.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shortest, explain-like-you-are-5 answer is <em>emotions.</em></p>
<p>For many people, their feelings are in bad shape, just like when you don't exercise your body and you lose strength and have a hard time doing strenuous activities, if you don't exercise your emotions they become very fragile and as a result people tend to hide from things that make them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This kind of hiding usually means believing in something that makes them feel better about themselves or their decisions, and if someone questions that belief, they start to feel that discomfort rise and they hide even deeper in that belief. This is why logic and facts don't change them.</p>
<p>So how do you change them? You can't. You can only give them the facts and the chance to change themselves and go through that discomfort on their own, at their own pace. Be happier with your life and <em>show</em> a better way to live instead of trying to force others to bend to your own beliefs, or you will end up pushing them further away.</p>
<p>How do you keep your emotions healthy enough that you don't end up hiding also? You exercise them by facing uncomfortable things, by listening to people who have different ideas and trying to understand them, by doing something hard like being empathetic to strangers, to loved ones, to the less fortunate. By examining your own weaknesses and mistakes and learning to stop feeling bad about your embarrassing or distressing thoughts, and learn to forgive yourself and learn positive lessons. By letting yourself feel bad about things, by letting yourself cry when you need to and laugh whenever you can. Feelings of fear and anger are instinctual feelings to fight discomfort, and need to be broken down and understood so they become something positive.</p>
<p>Your emotions are like muscles, and like developing muscles, it hurts at times. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
