		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smelling salts are truly vile. It’s very strong ammonia. It doesn’t “smell bad” it’s a chemical attack in your sinuses that you can’t ignore, like tear gas or something.</p>
<p>Years ago when I worked in the ER there was a particular challenge. Habitual drunks would come in literally comatose. If you monitored them and gave them some IV fluids they would always wake up safely, in time. BUT a small number would come in drunk AND with a life threatening brain injury (often with little or external trauma, from falling down...drunk) . How to tell the difference? You can’t do head CTs in every drunk in a busy ER (and some habitual drunks would get like 80 CTs a year). Enter the supertucci brain injury severity test. I would crack one of these and cram (I mean gently place) it up one nostril. If they couldn’t muster the 10 neurons to pull it out (and they really wanted to pull it out since it is so obnoxious) it was OFF to the CT scanner for a sometimes life saving scan. On average my ER has one case a month of a drunk who didn’t sober up over time, got a CT and only then we realized he also had a brain injury we’ve been sitting in for hours. I had zero. 25 years later I still feel good about that. </p>
<p>Edit: drinks to drunks (sorry on phone)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when I was taught to examine cranial nerves in medical school, I was told to not use the always-available alcohol wipes to test the olfactory nerve (the nerve that lets you smell things.) Reason being noxious stimuli actually trigger sensation in the nasal mucosa, which is the trigeminal nerve, rather than stimulating the olfactory nerve. Smelling salts cause pain in the nasal mucosa, not an actual smell, that jolts you back into consciousness. Kind of like being slapped or getting a bucket of cold water dumped on you. </p>
<p>Edit: ELI5. Right. Sorry. Smelling salts don’t smell you awake, they hurt the inside of your nose to wake you up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
