		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles are often made up of type I and type II muscle fibers. Type I use oxygen to make ATP (energy) and fatigue slowly. Type II use glycogen stored in the muscle to make ATP, but fatigue quickly. Type II muscle fibers are for power and speed and fine motor control. The shakes come from fatigued type II muscle fibers in those rarely used muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They shake because your neurological system is not efficient at recruiting motor units.</p>
<p>A motor unit is a nerve and all the muscle fibers that it innervates. When we have good strength and endurance, there is a smooth &quot;wave&quot; of contraction where the body recruits certain motor units initially and as those units fatigue, it recruits new ones in their place. </p>
<p>When a lift or movement hasn't been practiced much, the body is inefficient at this &quot;wave&quot; of recruitment. So instead of a steady, smooth contraction of the muscle, we're left with a rough, shaky contraction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So most of the answers here talk about fast and slow twitch muscle fibers.</p>
<p>I think the answer has to do with motor units (several muscle fibers activated by the same motor neuron). According to the size principle you start with activating the smallest motor unit and if more force is required you also activate larger motor units, so multiple motor units are active at the same time. When the smaller motor units get to tired they become inactive. This results in a less precise control of the force your muscle produces because only the larger motor units are still active, hence the shaking of the muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think anyone actually answered the question.</p>
<p>The reason why a muscle will shake during and after exercise given this muscle was never trained or rarely used before is the connection of the brain and the muscle itself. </p>
<p>To operate any muscle the brain sends a signal through the nervous system to the needed muscle but the way it actually works is the signal gets to a motor unit (a transformer hub of some sort) that then through some electro chemical reactions contracts muscle fibers. Now those motor units can be in control of one or many muscle fibers. Big muscles like those in the legs (quads specifically) have motor units that are responsible for hundreds of muscle fibers. </p>
<p>But you do not contract all muscle fibers every time you use the muscle. (And not all motor units either) It’s just not efficient to do it that way. Typically the majority of them are reserved for when you need to lift something heavy or run etc. so when it comes to actually recruiting those extra fibers and units, you have to do something you simply aren’t used to be doing. This makes the signal connection to be ‘choppy’ and which is why the muscle can’t stay contracted (shake). </p>
<p>You do get used to it very quickly though and the mind muscle connection that you develop through training stays more or less with you for life. </p>
<p>This is also the reason why people who used to be muscular/sporty, can regain former strength/size much quicker than someone starting out from scratch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscular contraction comes from a series of action potentials - signals that are sent from your CNS (Brain, Spinal Cord). As the amount of desired force of contraction increase, the rate of these action potentials increases to the point where instead of waves o neuronal signals, they become one steady signal, producing the optimal amount of contraction. (Think of it like a whole bunch of waves gradually increasing speed until their continual stimulus is enough to cause one large, steady stimulus to the muscle. </p>
<p>However, where twitching comes in, is when the muscle fibres and the the CNS itself begin to fatigue from being used (depletion of energy stores, breakdown of muscle fibre, and exhaustion of neural signals). At this point, the action potentials sent down to each motor unit are not strong enough to produce that continual peak force we talked about, and instead, those tiny rapid waves of action potentials cause the muscle to twitch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
