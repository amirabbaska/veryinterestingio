		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean, there aren't people who would say &quot;gross&quot; at some of the things you mentioned, but more a &quot;so what?&quot; Generally people are either interested or indifferent regarding scenery. It took me a long time to appreciate scenery, I spent my childhood living in Africa and only now that I'm 20 and living in the UK do I appreciate the simple things like a nice sunset as it's a contrast to what I normally see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to be an ancient thing. I mean, you spend your whole day hunting, gathering, sleeping, hanging out in dark caves and then suddenly there is this beautiful combination of blue, orange, yellow(which also may remind you of fire=warmth, hot food and water) up above you-and everyday it's different. And if you're lucky, you might wake up to see it again and discover other new cool things by the next time it happens; the end of a productive day, or maybe a bad one.  But there is a promise of a new one where there may be more food, better shelter, and a nice cool dip in the ocean. </p>
<p>Life simpler pleasures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has a VERY great deal to do with dopamine release and activation. Mountain top experiences, they are sometimes called. </p>
<p>Those special events we've seen that we recall for very often, the rest of our lives. The valley of the Yosemite at peak Merced River run off, with nearly 15 waterfalls easily seen dropping 1000's of feet, many of them. I was in awe for 45', saying, Oh, OH, OH!!! When we get that blast of DA, it enhances and facilitates long term memory lay downs, creating synaptically reinforced memory, which is very rarely forgotten.</p>
<p>We see this all the time. A lovely piece of music, such as Carmen Burana, the Fortuna segment, among others, such as the scherzo in the Ninth Symphony and the Chorale at the end. OR, &quot;Oh, honey, that's our song.&quot;</p>
<p>Recall specifically with my girl sitting at Loma Point, watching the sunset thru a foggy haze, where it all turned golden, and a ship sailing north, about 1 mile out, leaving a black trail behind it. Utterly unexpected and lovely. Permanent memory lay down from the DA boost it created. Sensory overload and remarkable.</p>
<p>Or a first time at Disneyland, and I recall it yet now, 60 years later. Lots of other events, the Great Pyramid seen from the Mena Palace among the date palms in Giza. Tut's golden mask, real and golden and utterly impressive in all its ancient colours.</p>
<p>It's DA release, you see. This explains a good bit of it:</p>
