<p>Yes, there could be additional forces that ordinary matter does not feel.  In fact, we already have examples of something like that, in that electrons do not feel the strong force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In principle, there could be an entire second &quot;standard model,&quot; containing all sorts of particles and forces that are totally disjoint from the ones in the standard model we know. They only way we could detect their presence would be gravitationally. Or perhaps there could be interactions between the two models, but only at a very, very high energy, so that at low energies they are effectively decoupled. </p>
<p>I'm currently a physics grad student, and I once was talking with one of the experimentalists who's looking for dark matter in the form of WIMPs (weakly inetracting massive particles). I asked him about this &quot;disjoint standard model,&quot; and whether it could account for dark matter, and his answer was basically, &quot;Well, it certainly could be true, but it sure would suck for our efforts to detect it experimentally.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind, Dark Matter is a tool we use to explain why our observations don't match our otherwise expected results. We have never directly observed dark matter. We can't know for sure exactly what properties it has. We know what properties it doesn't have because if it had them, we would have observed them already.</p>
<p>However, for dark matter to &quot;work&quot; (to solve the problem it was thought up to solve) it would have to be &quot;non-self interacting.&quot; I'll try to explain why.</p>
<p>Let me start by explaining why we think dark matter exists. We started looking at galaxies a few decades ago. We calculated that a galaxy's brightness could tell us about how much mass was in there. We know from our solar system that 99% of the mass of the system is in the sun. We know how bright stars of different masses are, so we used that to figure out how massive a galaxy should be. On galaxies we can see well, we actually know how matter is distributed from the center moving out. </p>
<p>We also know that light gets Doppler Shifted when stars are moving toward us or away from us. So in a spinning galaxy you have one side moving away from earth and another side moving toward us. Since we can find they Hydrogen Emission Spectrum in the light from these stars, we can tell how fast they're moving by how far the emission spectrum has shifted. Again, we can see how fast stars are moving from the center moving out.</p>
<p>So scientists took these two pieces of information: We can calculate the mass of a galaxy based on how much light it emits. From that we can calculate how fast it should rotate using updated versions of Kepler's Laws for orbits. Then we checked that number vs what we measured for how fast the galaxy is actually rotating and we found that these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve" target="_blank">two numbers are different!</a> Stars near the edge of galaxies are moving much faster than we predicted they would based on their mass (brightness).</p>
<p>One solution to this problem was Dark Matter: what if there is mass we can't see? It would have to be gravitationally attracted to the galaxy to make an impact on how the galaxy spins. To actually solve the problem though, this Dark Matter would have to form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo" target="_blank">cloud shape, a halo,</a> around the disk of the galaxy. If it forms a halo, then that means it can't be the standard matter we see every day. </p>
<p>If you have a big swirling cloud of regular matter, tiny particles rotating around a central axis, eventually those tiny particles start colliding and bumping into one another. Some times they stick together from electromagnetic forces, other times they bounce off and scatter. If you wait long enough a system like this will form a disk. This is because of the Conservation of Angular Momentum. At first every particle in the cloud has it's own random angular momentum. The cloud as a whole has angular momentum equal to the average angular momentum of all the particles in it. Particles swirling in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction run into particles going the &quot;right&quot; way, slow particles get bumped by faster ones. Over time the angular momentum of each particle gets closer and closer to the average angular momentum of the whole cloud. Let me know if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So this is why people say dark matter isn't effected by Electromagnetic forces. If it was, then dark matter particles would average their angular momentum over time to form a disk. But if it formed a disk, it wouldn't explain the observations we make about galaxies. Also it would effect our observations about electromagnetic interactions here on Earth, but we haven't observed that.</p>
<p>Dark matter is still part of the frontier of physics. We should talk about it carefully, because it may be different than we describe it today, or it may not exist at all. It is just the most popular way to explain a set of discrepancies. Dark Matter still has problems, and there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Alternative_theories" target="_blank">other</a> (less popular) ways to explain the discrepancies without inventing a new kind of matter, never before seen. Those still have problems too. </p>
<p>I worry that people talk about Dark Matter today with the same certainty scientists discussed Ether in the 1800's. Just remember that its not on the same stable footing as Relativity or Quantum Mechanics. There are still a lot of questions to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
