		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man the first ELI5 I can answer! I'm a pastry cook and I love chocolate!</p>
<p>So technically the true chocolate classifications are white, milk, and dark. If there is a chocolate labeled &quot;extra dark&quot;, it's just an extra marketing term. (Semi-sweet is a subclass of dark because it does not contain milk)</p>
<p>The main ingredients in chocolate are chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids and dairy fat (for the sake of the ELI5 we'll just call these &quot;milk&quot;), flavoring, and lecithin. The flavor is usually vanilla and is in almost all chocolate, so we're going to ignore it. Lecithin is an emulsifier (which means it's the thing that helps keep the chocolate smooth) and is in almost all chocolate, so we'll ignore it. NOTE: in this context, chocolate liquor is <em>not</em> alcohol. It is the name for the paste that is made from ground cocoa beans. I know that's kind of confusing, but just roll with it. </p>
<p>So the ingredients that vary widely between the classifications are: chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, milk, and sugar.</p>
<p>White chocolate contains: cocoa butter, milk, and sugar.</p>
<p>Milk chocolate contains: chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, milk, and sugar.</p>
<p>Dark chocolate contains, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, and sugar</p>
<p>That is the simplest explanation for what the differences are, and if you're happy with that then stop reading and go eat chocolate. But I will expand on what the percentages you see on chocolate packages mean.</p>
<p>If you eat two different brands of high quality chocolate, both labeled as 70%, you would probably notice that they taste very different. Why is that?</p>
<p>The percentage on packages is the percentage of the actual cocoa bean that is in the product. So a dark chocolate at 70% is made with 70% cocoa bean and then 30% other ingredients (in this case sugar, vanilla, and lecithin). A 45% milk chocolate is made of 45% cocoa bean and 55% other ingredients (sugar, milk, vanilla, and lecithin).</p>
<p>Okay so if they contain the same amount of bean why do they taste so different? Well, part of it can be the variety of bean and the roasting process, but that's more into the nuanced flavors(fruity, nutty, caramel, etc). The biggest factor in the actual intensity of the chocolate flavor is that processed cocoa beans have two components. Remember above? <em>Chocolate liquor</em> and <em>cocoa butter</em>.</p>
<p>So a 70% chocolate might have 45% chocolate liquor and 25% cocoa butter. OR it might be 60% chocolate liquor and 10% cocoa butter. Either way it's labeled as 70% chocolate. A higher percentage of chocolate liquor will give you a more intense chocolate flavor. So basically, a cheaper chocolate can taste better than an expensive chocolate if it has a higher content of chocolate liquor.</p>
<p>Lemme know if you want any more info or fun facts about chocolate! I'm off to go see Thor: Ragnarok, so I'll check back later.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy crap you guys. When I left, OPs post literally had like 200 upvotes and I was like, &quot;Cool, the few people that read this will know some new stuff!&quot; I never expected to see so many responses! I'll have to get back on tomorrow and respond to more of you. It's almost 1am and I need to go to sleep for now.</p>
<p>Also, thank you for the gold! I'm happy to share and discuss and learn new things from others. I'm glad someone thought what I shared was worth that much!</p>
<p>Also also, everyone should go see Ragnarok. My god that was a good movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The type of chocolate depends on the sugar to cocoa ratio, and the inclusion of other ingredients such as milk.  The darker the chocolate, the more cocoa and less sugar and other filler it has.  The darkest of chocolates are around 80% cocoa.  As the chocolate gets lighter, more sugar and additional ingredients are added.  If I remember correctly, Hershey at one point was no longer able to call their products chocolate because they did not contain the defined amount of cocoa butter.  They had to call it a chocolate flavoured candy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Mostly the question was answered, but I'll REALLY ELI5:</p>
<p>-Milk chocolate must contain milk. You can even have dark milk chocolate.
-Dark chocolate just means there is more cocoa product than &quot;the average&quot; milk chocolate.
-White chocolate doesn't have cocoa powder, and usually contains some kind of milk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually legal definitions set out by the FDA as to what constitutes different kinds of chocolate.  And as a chocolate scientist (yes, that is actually my job) these are things I work with every day when I'm formulating new products.</p>
<p>Milk chocolate must contain at least 10% of what we call chocolate mass (which is cocoa beans that are ground into paste) and 12% of milk solids with 3.39% milk fat.  So essentially, milk chocolate has to have a milk component and a chocolate mass component.  The rest of the chocolate is made up of sugar and cocoa butter.  Cocoa butter is the fat portion that is extracted from the ground up cocoa beans.  </p>
<p>Dark and extra dark are actually not terms that have legal definitions.  They are used primarily for marketing purposes.  However, semisweet and bittersweet ARE legal terms that actually have the same definition.  </p>
<p>Semisweet and Bittersweet chocolate must have at least 35% chocolate mass and no more than 12% of milk solids (having any milk in it is purely optional though).  </p>
<p>Bittersweet is often used when talking about a chocolate that contains more than 50% chocolate mass, but usually once you start making chocolate with that much chocolate mass in it, you just start referring to the cacao content.  Ex. Ghirardelli has a really popular 72% cacao chocolate square (in the red wrapper) and they have an 86% cacao chocolate (called like intense dark or something).  </p>
<p>It's also really helpful to remember that the more chocolate mass you add to a chocolate the less sugar is in it.  That is why &quot;darker&quot; chocolates are more bitter.  If a chocolate is 72% cacao, it is ~ 28% sugar.  If it has 86% cacao, it has ~ 14% sugar.</p>
<p>Chocolate is quite literally my life, so if you have follow-ups, I am here for it.  </p>
<p>Source: real life chocolate scientist.  If you buy chocolate at a grocery store, you have probably eaten my chocolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
