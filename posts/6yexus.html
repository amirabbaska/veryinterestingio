<p>Meditation is about focusing on the breath and letting thoughts come and og - not about blocking them out. So why do this activity - sitting down and focusing on the breath - alter the brain?</p>
<p>They say we get more grey matter. What is the purpose of this grey matter? Are there other activites that produce more grey matter?</p></div></div>

<p>Look, <em>everything</em> physically changes the brain's structure. Reading this very sentence has altered your brain's structure. That's how our brain works. If our brain couldn't change, we'd never <em>experience</em> anything, because synaptic connections is how the brain does stuff. </p>
<p>Your brain also creates new brain cells <em>every single day of your life</em>. </p>
<p>Our brain is not static. It's constantly changing. </p>
<p>Now, meditation is still a very beneficial practice. It helps you focus, which is a very, very useful skill. But it ain't magic! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're a guitarist. When you start playing, your fingers don't do what you want them to, they're &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot;. After a while, they get lighter and more agile. Same goes with chords. Some chords start off by seeming like an impossible positioning of fingers. After a while, they're also really simple and immediate to do, you barely have to &quot;think&quot; to do it. What is happening is that you're developing muscle memory, both in your fingers and in your brain. It strengthens the connections between neurons and muscles.  </p>
<p>That's what meditation does; meditation trains your brain do to certain thinks: namely, control your focus or your lack of focus. In long term, your brain becomes better and better at taking control of your focus during long periods of time, which results in being able to do so with less effort. The brain is a muscle, and muscles can be trained -- and in the case for the focus, meditation is the training.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put your finger on your forehead. Right behind there is the part of your brain that tells the rest of your brain what thoughts are important and which ones aren't. If one part of your brain is going &quot;I want cake!&quot; and another part's going &quot;I want to lose weight!&quot; this part of your brain sorts through those thoughts and decides which takes priority. The more tired you are, the more this part of your brain struggles to work, and the more likely you are to do what the more impulsive parts of your brain want to do.</p>
<p>When you meditate, you &quot;work out&quot; this part of your brain, making it bigger and denser. This makes it better at its job and improves what we call &quot;willpower.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
