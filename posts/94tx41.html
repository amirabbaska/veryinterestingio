		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a free agent kicker/punter and coach. There are two major differences between kickoffs and field goals:</p>
<p><em>I'm only going to compare this at a college/pro level in order to keep this short.</em></p>
<p>1) Approach speed: kickers are moving faster when they make contact with the ball during a kickoff than they are during a field goal. It's not as big of a difference as it appears though. There's a fine line between ideal and too much speed. Too fast and your kicking leg won't be able to catch up and get locked out on ball contact. This is the main reason a lot of younger kickers actually hit a longer ball using a field goal approach vs a kickoff approach. </p>
<p>2) Tees: 1&quot; tees are allowed for kickoffs, whereas field goals must be kicked off the ground. You can hit a longer, higher ball with a tee, all else being equal. </p>
<p>No other reason should make a noticeable difference. Accuracy on field goals changes nothing with a kicker's technique. Kickoffs and field goals should all be hit the same exact way through ball contact. </p>
<p>[75 yard FG full speed and slo-mo] (<a href="https://streamable.com/xm1z0" target="_blank">https://streamable.com/xm1z0</a>)</p>
<p>[80+ yard KO full speed and slo-mo] (<a href="https://streamable.com/fb0nl" target="_blank">https://streamable.com/fb0nl</a>)</p>

<p>When I kicked off and had unlimited steps at whatever speed I wanted. And I was using a 2” tee </p>
<p>When I tried a field goal, I had 2 steps and a bunch of people trying really hard to get to me and mess up what I was doing. </p>
<p>Longest kickoff: 67 yards
Longest field goal: 52 yards </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some kickers could make 70 yard field goals if they were unopposed. They have to angle the ball straighter with a lower trajectory towards the goalpost as opposed to arcing it, which would get batted down by a defender. In pregame warmups and practices you can see kickers hitting pretty far fieldgoals that wouldn’t be feasible in an actual game </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also field goals don't count if you go under, so we count the distance that the football is 10ft off the ground for field goals, where kickoff we count the distance it hits the ground. Depending on the angle that could be 5 yards of difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact that there is a defense on a field goal is the reason.  You have to kick it higher initially to get over all the people trying to block it, and that drastically cuts down on distance.  </p>
<p>If there was no one trying to block field goals most NFL kickers could kick 70 yarders fairly regularly.  They do stuff like that in practice all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
