Why wasn't there a similar effect when the European Vikings came to love settle in in North America. Wouldn't they have brought similar diseases with them? Wouldn't they have caused a similar effect?</p>
<p>EDIT. It seems like it comes to the point that Viking society wasn't dense enough to produce the plagues that the later settlers brought. I never would have thought about that. Thank you guys so much!!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That assumes they had any significant contact with a group that then had significant contact (before dying) with more natives. Knowing the vikings it's also possible they were terrifying enough that the natives stayed the hell away. Remember the Europeans also brought horses, lots of people, and they intended to bring people and gold home. The Vikings were not thinking on that scale, but on a much more personal kind of scale. </p>
<p>Plus, the vikings could have met some brutally stiff resistance, while the Europeans had firearms plate armor, and horses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably has something to do with four big differences between Norse Medieval contact and Renaissance Europe contact with the New World.</p>
<p><strong>1) Norse contact benefited from a natural quarantining</strong>  In order for any disease to use Norse contact to get the New World it first had to travel to isolated communities in Scandinavia.  Then it would probably have spend time wintering in the Shetland Islands or Dublin.  Then it would definitely have to winter in Iceland.  And finally it had to reach Greenland.  At every stage of the way the Norse would spend time waiting out the worst of the weather for weeks at time.  And even if a disease had jumped from a walrus ivory trader in Greenland to an Inuit, the Inuit would also introduce their own natural quarantining to any disease because of their well spaced apart settlements.  Meanwhile Spanish contact came straight from crowded urban areas to the Caribbean (one of the most populated parts of the New World) within about a month a half.  This was short enough time for a person sick with small pox or measles to have spread it to his crew and they and their trade goods to still be be highly contagious when they started interacting with North American natives. </p>
<p><strong>2) Norse contact was much lighter</strong> The Norse only established one failed village on mainland North America, and the population of Norse Greenland topped out at 10k at the most, maybe a similar sized population of Inuit nearby.  Hispaniola, Spain's first colony, had a native population of around half to 1 million when founded and was tied by native trade routes through out the Caribbean.  </p>
<p><strong>3) Europeans were not as diseased when the Norse were visiting</strong>  The version of measles that that was fully acclimated to humans probably evolved around 1100 to 1200 AD.   The Black Death did not come to Europe until 1346.  Smallpox just reached Europe in the 8th and 9th centuries, but did not become widespread until the 16th century.</p>
<p><strong>4) Norse may have been more xenophobic</strong>  There is some evidence that the Roman Catholic priests who where the primary owners of the Greenland territory, may have forced the population to stay away from the Inuit for religious reasons and order to keep their population under thumb so they continue to benefit from the walrus ivory (If the Norse had known the Inuit's survival tricks they would not have been beholden to producing ivory for trade) .  As such, even if disease had made it to Greenland, the isolationist behavior of the Norse would have kept from spreading to the Inuit.  Meanwhile the Spanish were f*cking, trading with, converting, and enslaving what ever natives they could find.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>It comes down to population density and contact.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of A-level diseases in Europe (smallpox, measles, cholera, typhoid, plague, etc.) that whipped through North America require a certain population density to become endemic, and Norse farms and villages didn't quite make the cut. Remoteness and lower population density than the 15th century Spanish made Norse sailors less likely to have the diseases to begin with, and probably less likely to survive and keep them going if they did catch them.</p>
<p>These diseases also require a pretty good population density to take off once they get to North America. Many areas of the New World had just that (Easter Woodlands, Valley of Mexico, etc.), but I suspect that remotest Newfoundland did not. The combination of distance from other folks and a complete lack of immunity meant that, if the Native Americans did get a disease from the Norse, the whole family/village/clan was likely wiped out before they had a chance to pass it down the line. Newfoundland was also pretty far removed from the intra-continental trade networks that linked many of the cultures further south, so were less likely to pass disease on through trade.</p>
<p>Most of these diseases require physical contact or proximity to transfer. The Norse didn't stay particularly long, were limited in location, and a lot of their contact with the &quot;Skr√¶lings&quot; was violent, so there weren't as many opportunities for disease to spread as there would be under the sustained and (violently) intimate contact initiated by the Spaniards and others.</p>
<p>This website has some interesting theories as well:</p>

<p>TL:DW: Native americans didn't get sick from norse people for the same reasons europeans didn't get sick from native americans:
We had spread diseases because we HAD the diseases in the first place, which developed in highly dense population areas in XIII/XIV/XV century.</p>
<p>Norse people in X century didn't live in highly populated areas and much more important, they were <del>much less</del> <em>fewer</em> people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Europeans don't innately carry diseases - the Columbian Era Europeans were leaving crowed &amp; unclean cities, crammed into crowed boats with livestock for 3 months. All it takes is one sick person to get on board and everyone else is at risk. Escaped pigs from Spanish explorers probably spread diseases quicker than humans.</p>
<p>The vikings were traveling comparatively short distances from Greenland, probably with no livestock. Trade routes may have been more connected further South compared to Newfoundland, so disease spreads quicker with sustained contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
