		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non-human primates lack the neurological regions responsible for producing speech as well as the musculature in the throat. There are several theories of how language and learned vocalizations evolved in humans, songbirds, parrots, bats, and cetaceans (whales, dolphins), but a general consensus is that it arose independently several times. Some of my favorite neuroscientists who write about this are Erich Jarvis and Johan Bolhuis. Both are songbird researchers. Jarvis has a three part series on <a href="https://youtu.be/E0MtW9URFhg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> about this if you want to learn more. I haven't watched it but have seen him lecture a few times and he does a great job explaining it. </p>
<p>Also, I wouldn't refer to parrots as lesser animals in terms of intelligence. Corvids and parrots have exhibited a wide range of intelligent behaviors that was once considered only available to humans and some other apes such as tool use and recursive learning. A recent <a href="http://m.pnas.org/content/113/26/7255.full" target="_blank">study</a> has shown that the density of neurons in birds' brains, especially parrots and songbirds, are comparable to humans and primates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are mainly about Primates, but not much about Parrots.
Thing is, Parrots dont 'emulate' Human speech. They are just very good at repeating sounds. When a Parrots says 'Polly wants a cracker' its not really talking, it's simply Repeating <Sound A> as it has learned it gets an interaction when it does so. I cant think of any evidence that Parrots can put words in sequences or use them in any way that indicates an actual language. They can just reproduce the sounds they hear neaby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have some problems with this question. Namely, it is important to consider the evolutionary context of a species rather than attempting to quantify its intelligence or abilities. Without being facetious, primates aren't capable of human speech because they're not human. They are however capable of complex communication and have <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XsrhU2vV5PIC&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">intricate social structures</a> much the same as our own. The evolutionary factors that acted on humans to drive our ancestors to develop complex symbolic languages did not act on other primates in the same way. But that doesn't necessarily make them 'less intelligent' than humans.</p>
<p>Instead I'd argue that the notion of more or less intelligent is meaningless. To compare species we would first have to determine some measure of how intelligent an animal is. But that is impossible. We often use IQ tests to measure intelligence in humans but these test only make sense within the context of the human mind. There are many tasks at which other animals are vastly superior to humans whether for example, that's navigation or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/nov/07/animalbehaviour.psychology" target="_blank">visual memory</a>. These animals are very good these tasks because it is important to their evolutionary niche. Just the same as social intelligence and tool use is important to humans. You can't separate the intelligence of an animal from the rest of its nature and it's intelligence can only be understood within that context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
