		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of having to pee can largely depend on the state of your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Aka the nervous system you can't control. Your ANS is split into two branches, your sympathetic nervous system and your parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Your sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is commonly considered your &quot;flight or fight&quot; response. When your SNS is activated, your bladder is relaxed and you don't have a great need to pee.</p>
<p>Conversely, when your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is activated your bladder contracts and your internal urethral spinctor is relaxed. However, you also have an external urethral sphincter that you have conscious control of that allows you to delay micturation (the process of peeing). </p>
<p>So for example when you're out running errands your SNS will be more stimulated so your bladder relaxes allowing you to hold much more urine comfortably, and your internal sphincter contracts so you don't have to consciously contract your external urethral sphincter. But when you sit down to eat or arrive home, you become much more relaxed and your PNS is activated. This causes your bladder to contract and your internal urethral sphincter to relax. Regardless of how much urine you have stored in your bladder, this will give you the feeling of having to pee. You can choose to delay peeing by contracting your external sphincter or you can pee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Many times when the situation happens that you are referring to, it is related to bladder irritation by specific substances you've ingested. When your bladder is irritated, it sends signals to your brain that it needs to empty long before you've hit your &quot;actually full&quot; threshold. </p>
<p>Commonly known bladder irritants include anything caffeinated, anything with high amounts of sugar, and alcohol (amongst many other known causes--Google it, you'd be surprised how many are out there). You'll notice that if you cut down on these substances (especially if you eliminate them altogether--even for just one day) you won't get that striking urge to go when your bladder is relatively empty. </p>
<p>Not everyone is as sensitive to bladder irritants as others, but more often than not, they are the pesky culprits behind this occurrence. Many people who have urgency issues actually are irritating their bladders with their drinking habits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have this issue. If I hold it in too long and then try to pee, I can't. It literally trickles out and is very uncomfortable. I do what I can and then I come back in like 10 minutes and pee normally. I have been like this my whole life and have never met anyone with the same issue. What really sucks about it is if I am in a place where bathrooms are limited, like on a road trip, I will have to stop at the next rest area and then everyone gets pissed at me. (No pun intended.) It feels like the bladder gets so full that something closes off and then I can't go... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If youre dehydrated your urine wont be diluted and will irritate your bladder making you feel like you have a full bladder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
