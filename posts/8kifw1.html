		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They cannot very well block your brain when pushing x-rays through your mouth, but it isn't really important. The radiation isn't really that dangerous and the blanket for your body is more of a precaution than anything. Also radiation is more of a danger for quickly dividing cells in your body such as the bone marrow, small intestines, and the testes/ovaries. Protecting the gastrointestinal organs from radiation exposure is much more useful than cells which divide very slowly such as in the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. The sensitivity of tissues to radiation is called &quot;radiosensitivity&quot; and for the brain it is quite low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is to protect your thyroid and fast dividing cells from radiation.  Your brain cells do not divide quickly therefore are not really a risk for cancer. That and the radiation from a digital X-ray is like eating 3 bananas so even the blanket is pointless. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The X ray machine emits a fairly tight beam. But your body is translucent to X-rays, and scatters them. It's like if you took a spotlight and shone it into milk So, where the beam is hitting your body it is scattering in all directions. It's possible to use a blanket to block a lot of the X-rays coming out of your head from hitting the rest if your body. But the X-rays hitting your brain mostly go through your head, so there's no way to block them.</p>
<p>Studies have found statistical association between dental X-rays and brain cancer, but the risk of brain cancer is very low. Dental X-ray doses are low and have gotten even lower with digital X-rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, the blanket is more of a security blanket. The machine can't give you a lethal dose of radiation because it's on a timed shutter. Brain cancer is also very rare. Brain cells don't divide as often as other cells. Cancer occurs when something mutates the cell during division. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
