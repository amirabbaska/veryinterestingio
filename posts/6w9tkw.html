		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there's quite a bit of a difference. Our bodies are trained to sleep at night and stay awake during the day. If you're sleeping in the daytime instead of the nighttime your body is exposed to more UV light while you're sleeping through the sun &amp; while you're awake through artificial light. This leads to more problems such as increased risk of cancer, harder/longer time falling asleep, harder/longer time waking up, waking up more tired, diabetes, and other health problems. In fact, night shift workers have a 4x higher chance of getting cancer compared to their daytime colleagues.</p>
<p>Source: I wrote my college thesis on the effect of artificial light exposure on sleep &amp; overall health.</p>
<p>Edit: Woah this blew up a lot more than I expected it to. In my attempt to simplify things and 'ELI5' I seemed to have raised more questions than I have answered. Here's a list of sources I've used in my thesis which should rectify the points I've listed above. I don't really feel comfortable linking my own thesis, so hopefully, this will do. As /u/ILikeNeurons stated <strong>this is a relatively new field of research and in certain areas, we don't know enough information to make a proper conclusion.</strong></p>

<p>One thing I want to point out is that yes using blackout curtains, sleeping in a room without windows, etc. can help counteract most of what these studies are stating. BUT any light/artificial light exposure in the hours leading up to bed and while you are sleeping shifts your circadian rhythm, suppresses melatonin production, and disrupts sleep. This leads to an increase in the detrimental health effects such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc. </p>
<p><strong>It is the sleep deprivation, deficiency, and suppression of melatonin, that mainly causes these problems</strong></p>
<p>Feel free to message me any questions you guys might have (as many of you have done already), I'll be happy to answer them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two hormones at work that regulate your sleep pattern. Serotonin and melatonin.
Serotonin is associated with sun-light and helps you wake up, giving you focus.
Melatonin is produced at night and makes you feel drowsy, ready for bed.
If you don't follow the sun-cycle for waking up and going to bed you risk disturbing the Serotonin/Melatonin balance.
Low levels of serotonin are associated with a depression called SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked 6p to 2a, the exact opposite of what some consider a normal shift. I stayed up until about 8a, slept until 3:30p. I had blackout curtains to help me sleep and the office had those fake sunlight lamps. I was more productive after work because there was less distraction from others. Once I switched to now working 6a to 2p, I haven't noticed a difference. Only thing that sucked was all the bars were closed when I was leaving work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I'm not an expert in this field but I am someone with a <em>terrible</em> sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Most days I'm awake for ~14hrs, the earlier I go to sleep, the less sleep I need, the later (from the norm) I need WAY more sleep.</p>
<p>Using 10PM as a base, every hour I stay up <em>past</em> that, I need one more hour of sleep. I'm fine with waking up at 6AM if I go to sleep at 10PM but if I go to sleep at 5AM (which is the norm), I need 14-15hrs worth of sleep.</p>
<p>Something I've realized with experience, your body KNOWS when it's day time and when it's night time, if you're not following the 10AM-12M to 6AM-8AM sleeping pattern, you will suffer. I've spent a day or two without any sunlight, clocks or human interaction and my body still knows, it somehow keeps track.</p>
<p>The effects of sleeping late include digestion problems, intolerance to ANY food for a good 4hrs after waking up, <em>severely</em> reduced REM, fog-brain, heavy limbs, lethargicness, lack of reality, productivity, increase in creativity, and most strangely, your empathy and sympathy for others goes to virtually zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
