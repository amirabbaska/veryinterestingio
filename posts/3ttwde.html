		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At trial, there are two types of examinations: the direct examination (i.e. your opportunity to question the witness <em>you</em> call to the stand) and the cross examination (i.e. your opportunity to question to witness the other side calls). </p>
<p>When examining your own witnesses, you are not allowed to ask what are called &quot;leading questions.&quot; Leading questions are questions where the answer is implied in the question (&quot;you're a redditor, correct?&quot;). Some judges will even consider any yes/no questions to be leading (&quot;were you on reddit last night?&quot;) </p>
<p>You <em>are</em> allowed to ask leading questions to 1) witnesses you are cross-examining; or 2) witnesses you are direct examining, but who the judge has declared hostile for some reason (e.g. you ask them their named and they say, &quot;f*ck off&quot; and everyone can tell it's going to be a struggle for you to ask them open questions) EDIT: or (in federal court and some state courts) 3) witnesses you are direct examining but who are either adverse parties or witnesses for the adverse party. </p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, thank you guys so much for all the upvotes and for the gold! I'm glad I could be of help, and it's awesome to see so many people interested in the legal system. </p>
<p>One more EDIT: As others have so nicely pointed out, I never really answered the initial question! Why would a lawyer want to declare the witness hostile? </p>
<p>Let's start with why leading questions are typically not allowed on direct examination.
In the american legal system, the goal of a trial is for the fact-finder (whether it be a jury or a judge in the case of a bench-trial) to determine the truth about what happened. The witnesses are called for their benefit. </p>
<p>The goal of direct is for the witness to tell their side of the story (I'm using &quot;story&quot; loosely here, as it could also be an expert witness, etc.). The fact-finder will listen to determine 1) whether the content of the story is believable 2) whether the witness him/herself seems credible. Now consider, how can a fact-finder determine these two things when some slick lawyer is leading the witness into yes/no questions? At that point, it basically becomes the lawyer testifying, not the witness. </p>
<p>However, when a witness has proven unable to tell their story, whether it be because communication is difficult for them (eg. they are a very young child, they have some sort of disability, etc.) or because they are simply acting hostile, the court will allow them to be questioned in the next best way which will still result in information being dispensed to the fact-finder so that they can do their job. This next best way would be through leading questions. </p>
<p>So why would a lawyer want a witness to be declared hostile? The answer is so that they can ask them leading questions. The advantage of being able to ask leading questions, besides being able to move the trial along quickly (it might take hours for a young child to answer very basic non-leading questions) is that you can formulate the questions in a way such that you pretty much always get the answer you want and that you expect. Thus, the lawyer will be able to basically use the witness as a mouth-piece through which they can tell their clients' story exactly as they see fit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Australian lawyer here.  Another situation a lawyer might seek leave (ie. ask the judge) to treat a witness you have called as hostile is when they give inconsistent evidence.  For example, if they said one thing in a police interview and then 3 months later at the hearing they say something inconsistent with that evidence you can then ask them leading questions.  </p>
<p>For example, you might say &quot;you've been intimidated into giving this different evidence today, haven't you?&quot; which is a leading question.  If you didn't seek leave to treat the witness as hostile you would be stuck asking open questions like &quot;why is your evidence different now?&quot;.  That question is not as powerful and may not lead to the answer you want.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has probably been answered below , but:</p>
<p>There are limits on the way you can ask questions on direct examination. You are not allowed to lead the witness which is essentially ask them a yes or no question. You are also not allowed to impeach your own witness.</p>
<p>There is much greater latitude on cross examination.</p>
<p>By having a witness declared hostile,the lawyer is asking that he be able to question the witness as if on cross examination even if the lawyer is the one who has called that witness.</p>
<p>Some criteria have to be met first either based on conduct of the witness established through other evidence already presented in the trial or the witnesses answers to questions on direct.</p>
<p>It  may be within the judge's discretion to allow  questioning as if on cross examination; sometimes it is automatic  if the criteria are met.</p>
<p>Other points to consider: in general if I put a witness on the stand, I am bound by what he says. If the witness is declared hostile, is possible I may not be bound by his statements..</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for completeness' sake, you are also allowed to ask leading questions if they're basic/introductory or otherwise uncontrovertial (&quot;your name is Jane Doe and you are 12 years old, correct?&quot;; &quot;you're the night watchman who was on duty last night, correct?&quot;), as a time-saving technique.  (Though this may be a de facto rule, simply because the opposition isn't likely to raise an objection when introducing basic facts... I'm not sure.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The familiar phrase is to treat the witness as hostile, but the question is actually simply asking, &quot;Can I have permission to ask leading questions&quot;? </p>
<p>Ordinarily, you're not allowed to ask leading questions for your own witnesses, because then you're simply testifying for them and asking them to affirm what you've said. (&quot;You were at home in bed on the night of Feb. 30, weren't you?&quot;, rather than &quot;Where were you on the night of Feb. 30?&quot; and then allowing them to answer.)</p>
<p>But because a &quot;hostile&quot; witness isn't cooperating enough to answer the question correctly, a court will give you permission to &quot;lead&quot; them and then simply nail them down to yes-or-no answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
