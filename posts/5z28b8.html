<p>You <em>definitely</em> do not want to drink the first two.  What they use in hygiene products is usually isopropyl alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's different kinds of alcohol.  Ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) is the kind you can drink.  It's in everything beer, wine, spirits.  It is the same compound no matter what drink it's in.  Isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O) is rubbing alcohol and is used in cosmetics, lotions and on your arm before you get a needle.  Methyl Alcohol (CH3OH), aka methanol or wood alcohol, is an industrial solvent in things like paint remover.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, we drink ethyl alcohol, not isopropyl or methyl alcohol, so that affects the smell.<br />
But a big part of the smell of our drinks is how they are made.  Wine is fermented from grapes, beer is fermented from grains and wheats, so a lot of the smell comes from those initial components.
Liquor can be made from wine(brandy),  potato/wheat(vodka), blue agave plant (tequila), sugarcane (rum),grain (whisky), or flavored with juniper berries (gin)- edited, thank you guys ;)
The container used for fermenting also affects the smell.  Often used is oak barrels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a chemistry definition, an alcohol is any similar group of atoms forming hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon bonds in an alcohol arrangement. There can be ethyl alcohol, which is ethanol found in gasoline and alcoholic beverages, and there can also be methyl alcohol which has a similar evaporation point and weight as ethyl alcohol, but it is poisonous to humans. </p>
<p>The alcohol in your first aid kit is usually ethyl alcohol with just a little bit of methyl alcohol added to make it un-drinkable. This is done in order to properly tax alcoholic beverages. If you sell alcohol for anything other than consumption, it's inexpensive and not taxed as drinking alcohol. However anyone could sell straight grain alcohol as 'medicine' and people could get drunk off it, bypassing the alcohol taxes. So the methyl alcohol is added to it to make it poisonous and unfit for drinking. Because the boiling temperatures are so similar, it's not viable to distill or separate the two alcohols. </p>
<p>Because there are different types of alcohol groups, not all alcohols look, smell, and taste, the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
