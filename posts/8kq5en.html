		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the study just now, but your quick answer is &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>When a bee stings and loses his stinger (and therefore rips out his guts), it has to do with physics and the tensile strength of what he stung.</p>
<p>Human skin, for some species (not specific to bees) is strong enough to cause that in stinging &quot;bugs.&quot; The bee is the most well-known, but there are others.</p>
<p>Bees (like any other species) attack or defend at need. </p>
<p>Please forgive both my use of &quot;bugs&quot; along with the possibility that the period belongs outside of the quotes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here are focused on the truth of your premise (i.e., that bees die when they use their stingers), but your <em>real</em> question is about whether organisms that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenoptosis" target="_blank">designed by natural selection to die</a> when they complete some task (usually reproduction, like salmon after spawning) are aware of their inevitable deaths. The answer is almost certainly <em>no.</em> The mental models of these organisms do not need to include predictions of what happens <em>after</em> accomplishing these tasks because the forces of natural selection cease with the closure of the reproductive window (because salmon do not exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment" target="_blank">parental investment</a>, genetic fitness becomes decoupled from survival <em>after</em> making babies). In other words, there is no selection pressure for such an awareness to be encoded in DNA through natural selection. </p>
<p>This explanation gets really messy when the discussion focuses on organisms with more complex mental models that are sensitive to experience (e.g., humans) and reproductive windows that extend into old age (e.g., grand-parenting), but it is sufficient for explaining why mental models constructed by natural selection (i.e., &quot;instincts&quot;) for organisms with limited reproductive windows might exclude mortality predictions. Its definitely an interesting topic, a buddy of mine from Toluca Lake studies it professionally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees are sterile.  They don't mind dying, because the only &quot;survival instinct&quot; that they would reasonably evolve is for the survival of the hive.  </p>
<p>A bee has no desire to live, because thousands of clones are born every day.  The bee will never pass on DNA, but if it can protect the hive then the Queen can create more clones so the DNA will spread.  The bee only desires to serve the hive.  </p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, a bee hive is one giant organism spread out over
thousands of disconnected bodies.  A bee dying when it stings is like you cutting your hand when you punch someone.  It might hurt a bit but it'll heal.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering that bee intelligence is collective rather than individual and how limited one such individuals mental capacity is due to the amount of neurons available, it is fair to assume that a bee doesn't actually &quot;know&quot; anything.
It's a biological machine running on fairly basic software called instincts.
Posessing self awareness would be a very detrimental quality for a worker or soldier bee to possess. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, your guess is as good as anybodies. It is impossible to determine this. You can have all the experts and technology in the world, but this question will forever remain unanswered in terms of bees being self-aware of their actions consequences. However, there may be a day where you can figure this out, which is beyond my imagination as to how this can be done. </p>
<p>However, animals follow natural instinct. They don’t just sting to sting. They sting because it’s natural instinct. I’m not sure how else to phrase this as to how I sound credible, because I really don’t have much knowledge with bees. However, I simply applied reasoning to answer this question. </p>
<p>I’m sure I will get academic arguments in response to my comment, and that is fine. Just keep it friendly, and if you really don’t agree with what I said, challenge me. I would love to argue my point, it’s a great learning curve for all involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
