		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it comes down to three major differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unambiguous Clarity</strong> - Programming is very similar to the arts, like music is used to express what we hear, paintings are used to express what we see, programming is used to express behavior. Programmers are forced to produce lines that express instructions that cannot be interpreted any other way. This helps in other thinking because it ensures precise language and programmers tend to focus on detail others wouldn't (which you can say is either good or bad, but different definitely).</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong> - In programming you are constantly using this concept of abstraction, or the ability to figure out the &quot;overall pattern&quot; from a few concrete examples. The ELI5 example of abstraction is if you show someone how to tie a shoe, they now can use the knot to tie any two strings together, they have abstracted the idea of the knot to apply in other situations. Programmers do this all the time with the creation of functions, things to help them do their job more efficiently. This skill allows programmers to think about the world differently, and usually they can pull from their past experiences in other disciplines to help them in entirely unrelated areas.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence to overcome difficult tasks</strong> - This is the trait I look for the most when finding who is teachable at work. Most people draw a line in the sand when it comes to technology that they are willing to learn and what they think is too challenging for themselves. For some people, it's as soon as you talk about math, for the general population the line is as soon as you look at something called &quot;code,&quot; for some programmers, it becomes what people call &quot;back-end code,&quot; etc. What I think separates most programmers from the general population is the willingness to cross that line of what you feel comfortable with, and get deeper and deeper into technology. A lot of people quit at the moment when technology becomes challenging. Back when I went to college at a respected school for programming (about 10 years ago), the first year drop out rate for Computer Science was over 50%. That's half of the people who considered themselves programmers decided it wasn't for them because they couldn't overcome the first hurdles. But for those that have stuck with it, this is what I find the most common among us, we all have some internal drive to constantly push ourselves out of the realm of problems we've solved before to new problems that might be difficult, but we have the confidence to know we can solve the problems.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing is break down problems and do things step by step.  When people ask me how to program I ask them to explain to me how to make a cup of tea.</p>
<p>They start with put tea bag in cup.  Boil water.  Pour water in cup.  Add milk and sugar (the filthy animals).</p>
<p>I ask them to break it down more.  This is where some people get confused.  </p>
<p>Take tea bag out of box.  Take cup out of cupboard.  Place Tea bag in cup.  Fill kettle with water.  Boil water.  Pour water into cup.  Wait.  Get milk from fridge.  Pour milk into cup.  Get sugar.   Get tea spoon.  Put tea spoon of sugar into cup.  Still cup with tea spoon.</p>
<p>Now things get interesting.  I ask them to describe it in more detail again.  Eventually they cant think of anything but I'll ask them to describe what muscles they use, to press the button on the kettle, to turn the tap on after placing the kettle under it etc etc.  At this stage you can also describe differences with programming languages.  Assembly code describes each muscle, each exact location of the objects.  C/C++ describes the draws and objects to get and where to place them, Java less items, Python even less etc etc.   </p>
<p>Some people say things like boil water while putting tea bag in cup.  This is a great analogy to multithreading.  However its best to describe the process in the most singular way.  Sure you can boil the water while putting a tea bag in the cup but you don't know exactly when it has boiled.  So you need to insert waiting times etc.</p>
<p>I firmly believe anyone can learn to program but then I look at how some people make tea.  If they haven't made that process even remotely efficient after 30 years I doubt their code would be much good either.  Still, its just thinking every step through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest lesson in thinking differently comes from debugging. It really humbles you.</p>
<p>A common scenario is going over the same piece of code that is creating a bug, but being absolutely certain that everything you wrote is correct. <em>There is no bug in my code. The computer is messed up somehow</em> is a thought I have over and over again even though I know it's crazy.</p>
<p>Then after staring for ages, you have this epiphany feeling when you realize where the problem was. When it's not a typo, it's usually due to a subtle assumption you made about how a function works that wasn't true, but totally changed everything.</p>
<p>Nowadays when I'm SURE I'm right about something, but someone disagrees with me (a moral or political opinion, for example), I'm very suspicious of that feeling of certainty. Instead, just as when I code, I learned to view my understanding of topics as provisional (especially when there are a lot of moving parts) and aware of the fact that there might be <em>unknown unknowns</em> - problems in my reasoning that I didn't think to check, maybe didn't even realize could exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is in problem solving; I believe coding is more deconstructionist than any other profession. Coding forces two things on you; organising an action into its basic individual movements, and writing them down with excruciating precision. That gives you the view that a lot of dynamics can be explained in chains of understandable parts. But the main part of time spent coding is actually not writing the code. That is maybe a third of it. The main part is debugging; trying to understand how what you wrote works with its environment and where that goes wrong. It is extremely detail-oriented. When the car of a programmer breaks, he will never stop at 'the engine doesn't run well', figuratively speaking. He will persist until he had found out which spark plug has a bent lead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans rely heavily on something called heuristics. Basically, if you solved a problem before using a set of actions, then using those set of actions again on a similar problem would probably work. It's not precise, but it's quick. For hunter-gatherer animals, thinking quick is the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Computers do not use heuristics. They use algorithms. Algorithms are slower than heuristics, they are more specific in scope than heuristics, and they always give you the right solution (so long as the parameters given are accurate). </p>
<p>So, coming up with an algorithm (a solution that works every time, and encompasses all reasonable use cases) is much harder than coming up with a heuristic. The advantage, however, is that you only have to solve the problem once. Once it's solved, the computer can execute it fast and repeatedly. In computer science, we have a saying: &quot;You either do a task one time, or many times.&quot; This means that if you're going to do something more than once, then you build it in such a way that it can be re-used an indefinite number of times.</p>
<p>A computer scientist has to think like a computer. Basically, we have to break every action, no matter how simple, into its basic atomic parts. Then, when we code it, we have to test it extensively from different angles. Can it handle these special exception cases? What if the user does something so stupid we can't even fathom it? </p>
<p>Most programmers today use frameworks, which are basically libraries of code that allow us to not have to reinvent the wheel. Such as using AJAX to dynamically populate a table of data. It's something that can actually be quite exhausting to do in code if you're just using straight JavaScript, but using a framework like VueJS lets you do it with just a few commands. Problem with that approach, however, is that the programmer still needs to know what is happening &quot;under the hood,&quot; or else fall prey to unintended bugs.</p>
<p>So, basically, what a few other people said: a good computer scientist is required to deconstruct even the simplest task in order to tell the computer how to do things. We have to think consistently logically, and that effects how we think outside of our coding, as well. The jury is definitely out on whether people are just born with the types of brains needed to think like a computer scientist or if it is learned (or how it is learned). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
