		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well their heart isn't beating for one thing. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, death by old age really isn't a thing. This is just a generic term assigned to older individuals that die of some condition (stroke, heart attack, etc) when the individual using the term doesn't know the actual cause of death, and suspects it was related to the patient's old age. You will (hopefully) never see a medical professional list the cause of death as old age. Are there any changes between alive and dead patients? Well this gets into the wonderful conversation of how we define death. Is a patient dead when their heart stops? Well they may have some brain function for a very short time after their heart stops. Some of their tissues can live for a surprisingly long time without the heart beating (brain death usually sets in before anything else). What about vegetative state patients? They have greatly reduced brain activity, but they aren't brain dead? However if we took them off life support their body would not support itself. The point I am trying to get at is that we don't really have a good way to define death, so it makes asking a question about what happens right after death kinda hard to answer. If you could be a little more specific about the cause of death, then you might be able to get a few more details. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When the cell dies, all chemical reactions halt and they reach <strong>chemical equilibrium</strong>. The &quot;displacement&quot; of some reactions from chemical equilibrium is what powers the cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of a follow-up question:</p>
<p>I obsessed for a while on a similar thought. I was at my dad's bedside when he died. It was actually a process that took over half an hour after he stopped breathing until there was no electrical activity on his EKG.</p>
<p>I'm having trouble with the phrasing of this... but wonder about how long his brain is still 'him'. I know the electrical signals are gone, but the network of connections is still there, along with any chemical component.</p>
<p>So for SOME amount of time, even though he is dead, everything that made him him is still in there. His personality, his memory, all the skills he learned over 85 years. I wonder how long until all of that degrades and slips away</p>
<p>Are most of those pieces of him still there 15 minutes later? An hour? Two?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's little detail into what causes Rigor Mortis.  During normal muscle contraction the body uses ATP to bind myosin to actin. These two molecules form a dynamic chain in which the myosin heads will bind and release from the actin, pulling on the actin and shortening the sarcomere (the smallest unit of the muscle cell).  ATP is required to release the myosin heads from the actin molecules but not to bind to them.  When death occurs, the body is unable to produce the ATP needed to unbind the molecules and relax the muscle.  This leaves the muscle in a state of unresolved muscle contraction.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wait but why had an excellent and EXTREMELY in depth treatment of this question as part of an article on Cryonics. That is the practise of persevering ones body right after &quot;death&quot; in hopes of being able to be revived on day in the future after medical advances have been made.</p>

<p>TL;DR death isn't a hard line in the sand. Immediacy after death some cells won't get the memo and will happily carry on their basic functions for hours. While others, (namely neurons), will start breaking down in minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
