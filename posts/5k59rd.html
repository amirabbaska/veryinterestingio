		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some animals like hydra, sea anemone and planaria are capable of total regeneration because they have special cells, called stem cells, that can refresh themselves and every other cell type in the animal. This means that the animal can constantly regenerate itself, so its cells don't accumulate damage and don't exhibit other signs of aging (like humans do).</p>
<p>Other animals (like humans) aren't so fortunate because we don't make the awesome cocktail of signals that direct hydra/anemone/planaria cells to be so awesome. </p>
<p>However, no animal is immortal. Hydra, anemone, and planaria can die if they get an injury that they can't recover from. This is because the signals that direct stem cells to form a specific part of the body are in a gradient that is usually from head to tail, so if you slice a planaria in half from head to tail, it won't be able to recover and it will die. </p>
<p>Likewise, if ALL the stem cells get destroyed (like by radiation), the animal will die. However, if even one stem cell survives, that cell will be able to replicate and restore the regenerative ability of the organism. </p>
<p>So it all comes down to regeneration: some animals can do it because they have the right gradient of signals throughout their lifetime, and other animals can't do it because they only have those signals in that specific gradient when they are embryos.</p>
<p>EDIT: I stand corrected! It appears that planaria will be able to recover from any bisection, whether vertical, horizontal, or zig zag. Thank you all for your polite contributions. </p>
<p>To everyone asking about mutations and cancer, planaria can get cancer, but they have a small(er) and tightly regulated genome that prevents harmful mutations from cropping up. Additionally, most mutations that happen-statistically speaking-are synonymous, which means that they don't affect the planaria's ability to live and thrive normally. Planaria have been studied under the effects of carcinogenic agents (things that cause cancer), though, so it's certainly possible for them to develop cancers and teratomas.</p>
<p>To everyone asking about the implication of stem cell in humans, I encourage you to google stem cell research + whatever condition you're interested in (ex: diabetes)! There's so much being done currently with stem cells, though there are a lot of controversial opinions surrounding this research. There are a lot of hopeful outcomes, though!</p>
<p>To everyone asking why we didn't evolve to regenerate, I would probably say that the cost of regeneration (increased probability of developing cancer) is too high to overcome.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas, or whatever holiday you celebrate! May your holidays be filled with warmth, peace, and love :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One word: Telomerase. It's an enzyme that adds redundant, non-coding junk to the end of a strand of DNA. </p>
<p>Whenever you replicate DNA, you can't actually replicate the last few bases because of the way the enzymes and the strands of nucleic acid are physically shaped. Basically, you have what looks like a scaffolding of many enzymes built up around the DNA strand moving from one end to the other. Easy right? However, the structure itself depends on <em>something</em> being present, so when you get to the end of a DNA strand, it's like having a ladder set up where one leg is on solid ground and the other leg is just dangling off into space. The enzymes, like any sane, OSHA-compliant carpenter say &quot;fuck it&quot; and leave the last 0.001% of the DNA replicate strand unfinished. This only becomes a problem after many decades of life for humans. But humans <em>REPRODUCE</em> fully new humans right? So how can this be possible if we constantly lose tiny fractions of our genome as we age and reach reproductive age?</p>
<p>Enter telomerase. The enzyme will add on a series of junk bases called &quot;telomeres&quot; to the end of a DNA strand so when they get truncated off, nobody cares and the organism is unaffected</p>
<p>Telomerases are inactivated in pretty much all non-cancer cells in an adult human or any other vertebrate and a large number of invertebrates. Bone marrow and other tissues with a very high turnover of cells might be exceptions to this general rule but I honestly don't remember</p>
<p>Telomerase making some animals immortal is also what makes many forms of cancer so goddamn deadly: unstoppable growth</p>
<p>So why do very primitive organisms have telomerase active at all times and theoretically live forever? They probably simply haven't had any selective pressure to lose it. Humans have. Humans reproduce by age 15 but live to be 80. Do they need to live to 80? Do they need to live to be 500 years old? Absolutely not. There was no evolutionary advantage whatsoever in maintaining these tricky, resource-consuming, potentially-tumor-forming enzymes from being active 100% of the time. So, at some point, our ancestors stopped expressing them except under relatively narrow circumstances. This probably happened more than 500,000,000 years ago, but I can't give an exact date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was discussed as it relates to lobsters in a human biology class. Human cell DNA has a tail section called a telomere. This telomere is a repetitive sequence of DNA that is mostly a signal that a meaningful sequence of DNA has ended. For example, if I were typing instructions without being able to use spaces: I might just include long trains of random letters or a single repetitious letter.  The cells multiply through division, and the DNA is &quot;unzipped&quot; and &quot;zipped&quot; back together each time the cell divides. A small piece of the telomere is lost each time replication occurs. Once the telomere is too short the cell dies instead of replicating. Massive cell death through lack of regeneration is what leads to the death of regular organisms (natural causes/old age). In living things that live an &quot;immortal&quot; life, this can be because a special ribonucleoprotein, telemorase, that elongates telomeres. As I mentioned, these are normally shortened during the reading of significant parts of DNA (transcription), but telemorase elongates the telomeres to make indefinite replication possible.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways that immortal animals have come to exist. The first one is that their telomeres don't decay. This leaves them for high risk of cancer and other genetic issues but they technically don't age. This is how lobsters do it. </p>
<p>The second big one is that whenever they die they revert back to a infantile state and start over again. This is down by a couple breeds of jellyfish. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Leach's storm petrel is an example of this and their telomeres don't shorten with each cell division. Instead the enzyme telomerase lengthens them. This means that the cells will divide indefinetly, much like in cancer cells.</p>
<p>This means that the bird is in effect immortal weren't it for predators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
