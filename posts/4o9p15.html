		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a mathematical standpoint:  For any N greater than 10 and less than 100, we can write it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N = 10x+y</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and its inverse, ~N as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~N = 10y+x</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're asking for the calculation (N-~N).  That can be simplified as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N-~N = (10x+y) - (10y+x)</p>
<p>N-~N = 10x + y - 10y - x</p>
<p>N-~N = 9x-9y</p>
<p>N-~N = 9(x-y)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for any 10&lt;=N&lt;100, N-~N will always be divisible by 9</p>
<p>If we use 41 * 14, we'd have x=4 and y=1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N-~N = (10(4)+1(1)) - (10(1)+1(4))</p>
<p>N-~N = 10(4) + 1(1) - 10(1) - 1(4)</p>
<p>N-~N = 9(4)-9(1)</p>
<p>N-~N = 9(4-1) = 9(3) = 27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for any 10&lt;=N&lt;=100, N-~N will always be divisible by 9</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number is divisible by 9 exactly when its digits sum to a multiple of 9. So 1836 is divisible by 9, 1936 is not. More exactly, a number and the sum of its digits both have the same remainder when we divide by 9. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3823 divided by 9 is 424 remainder 7. Also, 3+8+2+3 = 16 divided by 9 is 1 remainder 7</p>
</li>
<li>92838845 divided by 9 is 10315427 remainder  2. Also, 9+2+8+3+8+8+4+5 = 47 divided by 9 is 5 remainder 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if I want to know the remainder of a number after dividing by 9, I can just look at the remainder of the sum of its digits. They'll always be the same.</p>
<p>Now, remainders work nice under addition, subtraction and multiplication. If the remainder of N divided by 9 is 3 and the remainder of M divided by 9 is 2, then the remainder of N+M divided by 9 will be 2+3=5. If I add numbers, I can just add remainders. Same thing with subtraction and multiplication. Sometimes you might have to take an additional remainder, but it's good. For example</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The remainder of 40 divided by 9 is 4, and the remainder of 55 divided by 9 is 1. The remainder of 40+55 will be 4+1=5.  So 40+55=95 has remainder 5 after dividing by 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remainder of 43 after dividing by 9 is 7 and the remainder of 80 after dividing by 9 is 8, so the remainder of 80-43 after dividing by 9 is going to be 8-7=1. In fact, 80-43 = 37, which has remainder 1 after dividing by 9.</p>
</li>
<li>3823+92838845 will be divisible by 9 because 3823 divided by 9 has remainder 7 and 92838845 divided by 9 has remainder 2. So 3823+92838845 divided by 9 will have remainder 2+7=9. But 9 can't be a remainder, and 9 divided by 9 has remainder 0 so 3823+92838845 will have remainder 0, which means that it is a multiple of 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, if N and M have the same remainder after dividing by 9, then N-M will be divisible by 9. Their remainders are the same, so subtracting them will give remainder zero, which means that it must be divisible by 9.</p>
<p>If you have a number, then reordering it's digits won't change the remainder after dividing by 9, because this does not change the sum of the digits. The remainder of 435 after dividing by 9 is the same as the remainder of 4+3+5=12, which is 3. The remainder of 354 after dividing by 9  is the same as the remainder of 3+5+4 = 12, which is 3. This means that 435-354 will have remainder 3-3=0, so it is divisible by 9.</p>
<p>So, because reversing the digits does not change the sum of the digits, the difference will always be divisible by 9.</p>
<p>The field of math dealing with remainders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" target="_blank">Modular Arithmetic</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: It works for 11,22,33 etc and palindromes, 313,2332 etc, because 0=0*9, which means zero is a multiple of 9.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the fact that you are writing the numbers in base 10, and 9 is one less than that.</p>
<p>I'll do a general calculation here, so you see what's going on with N digits. Hopefully you will see the point where our base-10 system comes into play. So, taking something like</p>
<pre><code> AB...XZ = A*10^N + B*10^N-1 + ... + X*10 + Z</code></pre>
<p>the reverse would be</p>
<pre><code> ZX...BA = Z*10^N + X*10^N-1 + ... + B*10 + A</code></pre>
<p>Now let's subtract the bottom number from the top one:</p>
<pre><code> AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  
 =   A*10^N + B*10^N-1 + ... + X*10 + Z -  
   - Z*10^N - X*10^N-1 - ... - B*10 - A</code></pre>
<p>I'm gonna gather up the numbers from the coefficients A and B and ... and X and Z, so that we get</p>
<pre><code> AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  
 = A(10^N - 1) + B(10^N-1 - 10) + ... +
                  + X(10 - 10^N-1) + Z (1 - 10^N)  
 = A(10^N - 1) + 10 B(10^N-2 - 1) + ...-
                  - 10 X(10^N-2 - 1) - Z (10^N - 1)  </code></pre>
<p>where I have extracted the lowest common power of 10 from each parenthesis, and switched the signs where we get something negative.</p>
<p>Notice the look of each parenthesis now: They all are of the shape (10^something - 1). You probably know already what happens when you subtract 1 from a number like 100000...0000; You get lots of nines! Like 9999...999. So,</p>
<pre><code> AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  
 = A(99..N-1..99) + 10*B(99..N-2..99) + ... -
              - 10*X(99..N-2..99) - Z(99..N-1..99)  
 = 9*A(11..N-1..11) + 90*B(11..N-2..11) + ... -
              - 90*X(11..N-2..11) - 9*Z(11..N-1..11) </code></pre>
<p>We can now take all of this and place parentheses around, and then extract a number 9:</p>
<pre><code> AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  
 = 9 [ A(11..N..11) + 10 B(11..N-2..11) + ... -
              - 10 X(11..N-2..11) -  Z (11..N..11) ]  </code></pre>
<p>and you can therefore see that the number will be divisible by 9, since all the stuff inside the parenthesis are integers.</p>
<p>If this was done in, say, base-4, we would not get 999...999 inside the different parenthesis, but 333...333 instead. But because we wrote the number in base-10 as AB...XZ, and then subtracted the mirror image, the result is a 9-divisible number!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm a bit late but</p>
<p>Let the two distinct digits that appear be a and b, where a&gt;b</p>
<p>Hence the bigger number will be 10a+b and the smaller one will be 10b+a.</p>
<p>Since we know a&gt;b&gt;=0,
We also know 10a+b&gt;10b+a.</p>
<p>The difference is</p>
<p>(10a+b)-(10b+a)
=9a-9b
=9(a-b)</p>
<p>Since a and b are both positive whole numbers, and a&gt;b, a-b is an integer.</p>
<p>Thus the difference, 9(a-b), is a multiple of 9</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
