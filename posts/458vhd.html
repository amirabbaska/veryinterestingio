<p>FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where do they come from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How fast do they go?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity" target="_blank">wiki</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the <em>indirect</em> detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16" target="_blank">PSR B1913+16</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2" target="_blank">BICEP2</a> team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does this mean we can control gravity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the practical application?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice and concise review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv" target="_blank">Here</a> is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)</p>

<p>In short, gravitational waves are produced whenever masses accelerate, changing their distortion of spacetime. Anything with mass/energy can create these waves, but since gravity is very weak only the most massive of objects produce detectable waves. We (currently) rely upon the fact that the speed of light is constant to detect gravitational waves on Earth. If a wave passes between our detectors, it will either stretch or compress the distance between two points, thus changing the total traversal time for a laser beam.</p>
<p>The detectors themselves are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry" target="_blank">laser interferometers</a> and are large L-shaped constructions with each arm extending for 4km. The US-based LIGO project has two facilities near Livingston, LA, and Richland, WA. The detector takes advantage of the phase change a gravitational wave will cause in a laser beam. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This event apparently released 3 solar masses worth of energy.  </p>
<p>If that sentence sounds weird, remember E=mc^(2), which means energy and mass are interchangeable.  So to figure out how much energy that is, you have to take 3 times a solar mass (2&times;10^30 kg) and multiply it by the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s) squared, which is an awfully big number:</p>
<ul>
<li>5.4&times;10^47 Joules</li>
<li>1.3&times;10^41 kg or 66 billion solar masses of TNT equivalent (<strong>A typical galaxy made out of TNT</strong>)</li>
<li>2.2&times;10^34 kg or 11,000 solar masses of thermonuclear explosive</li>
<li>5000 Type 1a supernovae</li>
<li>100 hypernovae</li>
</ul>
<p>A sphere of lithium deuteride thermonuclear explosive that massive would be 36 million km across, and isnât even capable of exploding because it is so heavy it would immediately collapse into an 11,000 solar mass black hole.</p>
<p>But this was a release of gravitational energy, not light, so we never saw a thing, just felt the slightest ripple when it distorted spacetime as it passed by.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<hr />
<p>Gravitational waves are one of the last major, unconfirmed predictions of general relativity, a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity. General relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter. Gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around. They are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces.</p>
<p>But because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism, we can see light all the time (just look around!) while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation. Rumors are flying that LIGO, just such a system of lasers and detectors, has found a gravitational wave signal, probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other (because that's the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect).</p>
<p>This would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there, rather than reveal something new and shocking about the Universe. Think the Higgs boson a few years ago. It would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out <em>not</em> to be there: general relativity has worked extremely well so far, and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s, which won the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. LIGO's <em>direct</em> detection would undoubtedly be Nobel-worthy, too; the only question is whether it would happen this year.</p>
<p>This is exciting because a) it's direct, rather than indirect, confirmation that these things are there, and b) they'll open up a whole new window onto the Universe. Pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation, from visible light to X-rays, the ultraviolet, microwaves, what have you. Starting now we'd have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos, delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes.</p>
<p>So all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow, ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics. Or they could just be fucking with us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
