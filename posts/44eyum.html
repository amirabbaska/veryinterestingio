		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer has to do with the inside of your mouth being coated with lipids.  Allow me to explain:</p>
<p>Hardly anyone eats pure, bitter chocolate.  They eat chocolate that's been modified in flavor and texture by fats (butter, coconut oil, etc) and sugar, which result in a coating throughout your mouth which leaves you a bit thirsty.  Water works to &quot;cut the coating&quot;, but acidic and fatty fluids help more, because the fats that are coating your mouth are very soluble in both.  Milk contains enough fat to wash away most of the coating.  That coupled with the fact that things like orange juice with chocolate are distasteful to most palates leaves water and milk (with milk being preferable for most people) as the &quot;solution&quot;. (ha ha)</p>
<p>All of that said, the more advanced palate may enjoy something like port wine with chocolate, because it's acidic and contains alcohol, both of which are champion for washing the gunk out of your mouth, adding a wonderful complementary flavor, and preparing your mouth for the next bite of chocolate.  I would suggest a tawny port in this endeavor, should one be so bold.</p>
<p>Drinking wine with fatty meats and fish serves exactly the same purpose of palate cleansing and flavor enhancement between bites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you eat ice cream, you blast your body with all sorts of solutes.<br />
Ice cream has salts, but also sugars fats, amino acids, and more for your
body to absorb into the blood stream. When your blood becomes laden with
these chemicals, (mostly sugars) your blood becomes more &quot;concentrated,&quot;
giving your brain (hypothalamus) the signal of dehydration.  When water in
the hypothalamus leaves to the blood through osmosis, then the blood
concentration is greater than that of the hypothalamus.  This triggers the
thirst response in the body and brain.
If you were dehydrated, there would be a high concentration of solutes
in your blood, so you would become thirsty.  Eating ice cream, in a sense,
makes your body think it is dehydrated, and in a sense, I suppose it is.
This is one of the reasons that diabetics are thirsty all the time.<br />
Diabetes causes high blood glucose, and that increased concentration of
blood solutes makes the diabetic feel thirsty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cultural/personal tastes. I enjoy milk with my cake, brownies, etc., and it's naturally most appealing to me personally because it was regular during my upbringing. In other cultures, tea, coffee or otherwise may be more desired by the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>Likes dissolve likes. Water is a polar substance, which will dissolve other polar substances like sugar. Milk is less polar than water in this case, but still has the desired effect, your tastes permitting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: I'm adding to my explanation a bit here, because a few aspects I believed were obvious aren't so obvious in an ELI5 sense:</p>
<p>Water/milk dissolves sugar well as a result of both being polar substances, which is helpful as a result of your salivary glands being overcome with the rich food you're consuming. This isn't restricted only to sugar. Richness refers to foods that contain quite a bit of sugar, yes, but the fat/oil present in butter or cream is a non-polar substance. You may crave milk to wash down these substances, because milk contains fats of its own; as like dissolves like, it goes well with these types of treats and desserts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another follow up, there is so much concentration on sugar here, but I feel thirsty after eating my preferred type of chocolate with 75 - 95% cocoa. Especially the 95% one has very little sugar in it (googling nutrition data, Lindt 90% has 7g sugar / 100g).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
