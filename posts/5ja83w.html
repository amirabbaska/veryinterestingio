		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be reasonable to say that we don't have great scientific models that fully describe the intricacies of snowflake formation, hence the amount of hand-waving in some of the other answers here. It's an area that is currently being studied both through laboratory experiments and through computer simulations, so the best answer is probably &quot;We don't know&quot;.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-snowflakes-form/" target="_blank">this Scientific American article</a> from 2012, referencing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1272" target="_blank">this paper</a>, includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our team is the first to do both faceted and dendritic growth, using basic conservation laws and thermodynamics,&quot; Garcke says. With the model, Garcke and his colleagues found unexpected aspects of snowflake formation, such as the strong influence of bonds between surface molecules in the crystal. They also found that the speed at which the sharp tips of snowflakes grow is directly proportional to the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure why it came as a surprise to anyone that the pattern of snowflake growth was influenced by the amount of water in the atmosphere or the influence of bonds between surface molecules, but the portion of this relevant to your question seems to be that the former dictates the sharp tips, which would seem likely to produce sharp edges. But does that mean lack of water vapor is what makes curved edges?</p>
<p>I should also point out that it sounds like (I didn't read the paper) this sort of research seems to focus on creating mathematical models / simulations that produce the sorts of features seen in snowflakes, pulling in elements from physics. In other words, these models / simulations are rough approximations -- note the absence of images of realistic-looking simulated snowflakes in the article.</p>
<p>I'd argue, based on the information in this article, that we still only have a crude understanding of what's going on in snowflake formation that leads a macroscopic object to have such fine-grained, symmetrical complexity as shown in your photograph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can see that in some directions the snowflake (during its formation) will grow faster than in others. The most prominent is the sixfold symmetry of the main branches (I guess the snowflake in the picture somehow lost one of them), but also some smaller branches show the same growth directions (notice how the features at the end of the snowflake all are parallel to the main branches).
Furthermore, the snowflake is quite flat, because this direction is a &quot;slow growth&quot; direction.
So, during the formation of the snowflake it will grow quite quickly in its &quot;fast directions&quot;, leading to quite pronounced and sharp features. In &quot;slow directions&quot; the growth will be less pronounced and less sharp.
Why exactly those round shapes occur, I cannot tell. My guess would be, that there is some strain build up (due to unfavorable growth direction), which hinders smooth and even growth and will lead to the formation of small islands or cavities (like those holes). Round/spherical shapes are usually an indication for some energy minimization (like in soap bubbles, which minimize surface area for a given volume).
I hope that helps a bit to understand, I am by no means an expert of snowflake growth (but I know how other crystals grow), but there are definitely people out there, who do research on snowflakes and quite a lot is known about the formation processes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Mokshah is correct, but I don't think their answer covers all the mysteries of snowflake growth and symmetry.</p>
<p>Looking at the image OP linked, there are divots and ridges that are mirrored in different locations. The mirroring isn't perfect, but the specificity and variation in the shapes is surprising. Before getting too deep I should note, on the life-is-boring side of things, that collections of snowflakes images such as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/alexey-kljatov_n_4373888.html" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a href="http://snowflakebentley.com/WBsnowflakes.htm" target="_blank">this famous guy</a> often focus on &quot;ideal&quot; snowflakes and don't take images of or don't publish images of non-symmetrical snowflakes. So there is some selection bias. OP's image is more realistic because there is an arm missing and the symmetry isn't quite perfect.</p>
<p>Prediction of crystal shapes is most commonly done by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulff_construction" target="_blank">Wulff construction</a>. This gives you the minimum-energy shape for a crystal. It depends on the surface energy of the crystal, which is often temperature, pressure, and atmospheric-composition (eg, humidity, dirt, etc...) dependent. For water at STP with no contaminants, it is a hexagonal plate (not too surprisingly).</p>
<p>The best explanation for snowflakes that accounts for both the symmetry and the variation I know of is covered <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3795/why-are-snowflakes-symmetrical" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-snowflakes-symmet/" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, as /u/Mokshah has described, crystal growth is strongly dependant on environmental factors. These will vary from one snowflake to another, as well as at various times during the growth of a flake, but will tend to be constant across the size of a single snowflake. Thus, snowflake symmetry is maintained by the similarity of the environment across the flake, as well as the six-fold symmetry inherent to water.</p>
<p>However, note that random variations still occur. The symmetry in OP's picture is not perfect and there is an arm missing. This could be caused by any number of factors, such as dirt or growth defects or what have you. Over time these defects will accumulate and break the symmetry. That is why large snowflakes (also called &quot;hail&quot;) tend to be asymmetric.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are computer simulations where very small variations and very few basic rules lead to very intricate patterns - fractals, automatons, life simulations, and so on. I'm pretty sure there's also something out there simulating snow flake growth in a way that explains it, not just models it w/ nice graphics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Followup-question:
How does one manage to examine a snowflake in an SEM (I assume it is a SEM?) without it evaporating in the vacuum? Also there is the matter of conductivity - is it possible to sputter such a thing with gold or are there other tricks to enhance this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Edit: ok, just read up a bit on LT-SEMs. Would still be greatful for an answer regarding the issue of conductivity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
