<p>And yet, I've been reading and talking with non-experts involved in fitness science that we just haven't found the right material, with the right type of properties to replace real cartilage. </p>
<p>Doctors/medical researchers, what are the major hurdles faced by prosthetic cartilage today? </p>
<p>Edit: please keep this as ELI5 as possible, I don't have a very scientific background. </p>
<p>Edit2: Researchers : where is the research at now? What sort of time-frame are we looking at for general use of prosthetics, if you can provide one? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, first things first :</p>
<p>The synthethic hearts are not too good. In most cases they are used as &quot;bridge-to-transplant&quot; solution, not as an endgame. People don't survive too long on them. Also 3d printing body parts is highly experimental and pretty far from being a standard.</p>
<p>Now, yes we do use mechanical heart valves. They are pretty good. You have to take anti-koagulation medication for the rest of your life, but otherwise you are not really handicapped.</p>
<p>Mechanical knee/hip/shoulder/etc replacements are pretty okay as well. You can't do sports with them, but they enable you to live a painless life, which is a pretty big deal for a patient with osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Now, when we replace joints, we don't manufacture human-like structures. We basically build something out of metal, that works like the original, without actually being <em>like</em> the original. </p>
<p>Heart valves now are waaaaaaaaay simpler structures as joints or even cartilage. They are basically a few layers of cells that passively move. They don't have vessels, they don't regenerate, they have a very reduced metabolism (low turn over tissue). It's probably the easiest thing in the whole human to replace.</p>
<p>Cartilage on the other hand is a highly complicated tissue. It's capable of expanding and compressing, balancing the pressure of our whole body weight (and more, when you do movements like jumping). It's capable of storing water when under low pressure, and releasing it when the pressure rises, and various other things.</p>
<p>Manufacturing something like this is far beyond our current knowledge and technical abilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of things:
When we transplant solid organs, it isn't a magic fix.  People have to be near death to get a transplant and then have to take a LOT of serious medications to prevent rejection.  Miss a couple of days of anti-rejection pills, you end up in the hospital and might die.  After about 5-10 years, the transplant quits working.  We don't have any way to take your own stem cells and make a real replacement organ that matches you... yet.</p>
<p>We have really good prosthetic joints.  You don't have to take medications to prevent rejection, just install the metal joint and it works.</p>
<p>A lot of the failures of joint replacements are due to problems that don't have to do with the joint.  People who are obese wear out their joints faster, whether they are prosthetic or original.  The joint is not just the surface that bends, it includes all of the muscles.  It takes a LOT of work with physical therapy to fix the damage from the bad joint and get the new joint working.</p>
<p>There will never be a joint that you can install that will fix all of the pain and movement problems.  We are biologic and constantly remodel and have to retrain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some basic problems with such prosthetics. Cartilage is way more complex than it seem. Research is not this far yet and you don't want to endanger people with stuff that doesnot work as expected. Another major problem is, that the body doesn't like when new tissue is injected. The human body will reject the transplant in many cases, since the immune system will often classify this new tissue as hostile.</p>
<p>If you want some deeper information look for biocompatibility and transplant rejection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the media reports on 3D printed organs are unsubstantiated and optimistic to put it lightly. It is akin to putting pate in a piping bag and making the shape of the liver and then calling the media and saying &quot;we 3D printed a liver.&quot; Just because it is liver tissue and has the shape of the liver does not mean that it is a functional liver. Most researchers I've spoken with agree that 3D printed organs are 30+ years away barring an as of yet unforseen breakthrough. Veins and arteries will be possible much earlier however possibly within several years. </p>
<p>Several teams are working on 3D printing cartilage, it is one of the biggest opportunities in 3D printing. Hybrid cartilage is being created and implanted using hydrogels and other materials. 3D Printed scaffolds are being created to grow cartilage on. In vivo testing is being conducted with 3D printed scaffolds and directly 3D printed cartilage. </p>
<p>The main issues with 3D printing cartilage are in trying to recreate the sheer awesomeness that is cartilage. As you say it &quot;seems simple enough.&quot; In reality cartilage is complex. Its made of several different types of fibers and several other stuffs that make it all stick together. In one area a type of fiber is all in a row stuck together with protein. The next area its more of a weave of a different fiber with several different glues. Then theres an area with yet more glues and here the fibers are all lined up in a different direction. To top it all off the closeness of the fibers, amount and concentration is different throughout as well. Cartilage is kind of a super complex better version of carbon fiber. A matrix of a glue and fibers. It is very strong and wear resistant and replicating this and its complex structure is difficult. </p>
<p>This is a simple diagram to show you this: <a href="http://www.naturalheightgrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/F3.large_.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.naturalheightgrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/F3.large_.jpg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about what cartilage has to do. The meniscus in the knee has to take 60-70% of your body weight (which I suspect is higher than average for people with cartilage damage, as it's generally either athletes or overweight people) for a considerable portion of your waking hours, as well as having a pestle-and-mortar action against it under that load tens of thousands of times per day. You can't get in there to lubricate it or repair it other than with surgery. </p>
<p>Plus, it obviously needs to fit perfectly and you need to be able to fit it around all the ligaments. </p>
