		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was asked 1 year ago.</p>
<p><strong>1sicgsr</strong> gave the top rated answer. </p>
<p>&quot;I just did a quick experiment at work. The penny I used started at 0.056&quot; thick and 0.748&quot; wide. After 10 tons of pressure (22,400 psi) for 30 seconds the penny measured 0.051&quot; thick and 0.767&quot; wide. At 20 tons (44,800 psi) the penny measured 0.048&quot; thick and 0.788&quot; wide. The highest I could get my hydraulic press to was 28 tons or 62,720 psi. After 30 seconds under 28 tons of pressure the penny measured 0.045&quot; thick and 0.830&quot; wide. </p>
<p>At this rate, 1 psi squished the penny 1.75x10-7&quot;, or, 0.000000175&quot;. Assuming a &quot;smashed&quot; penny is 0.030&quot; thick (i don't have one to measure) the pressure needed to get it that thin is 171,428 psi or 76.5 tons.</p>
<p>At 0.0106 psi per penny, it would take 16,172,452 pennies for the bottom penny to be crushed to 0.030&quot;. </p>
<p>A stack of 16,172,452 pennies will be about 14.3 miles tall.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you need to define what is considered as &quot;crushed&quot;.</p>
<p>I will assume that by &quot;crushed&quot; means that the penny has reached it's yield strength. That's the strength at which permanent deformation will occur. </p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Stress_Strain_Ductile_Material.png" target="_blank">Stress-strain graph</a> for refrence.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Constants</strong></p>
<p>I will use the yield strength for zinc, since it is lower than that of copper</p>
<p><strong>Yield str Zn ~ <a href="http://www.nshoremfg.com/zinc_00c.pdf" target="_blank">30MPa</a> = 4.351 ksi</strong> (copper is ~117MPa)</p>
<p>I will use an initial width of <strong>0.748''</strong> which works out to an area of </p>
<p><strong>A = 0.4394in^2</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coinflation.com/coins/1982-2007-Lincoln-Cent-Penny-Value.html" target="_blank">Weight of a 2014 penny ~ 0.0025 Kg</a></p>
<p><strong>g = 9.81m/s^2</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Equations</strong></p>
<p><strong>σ = F/A (stress)</strong></p>
<p><strong>F=ma</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Force required to crush, F = σA</p>
<p>F = 4,351*0.4394</p>
<p><strong>F = 1912 lbf = 8,505N</strong></p>
<p>*<em>Fp = 0.0025</em>9.81 = 0.024525N**</p>
<h1>pennies = 8,505/0.024525</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong># pennies = 346,789 pennies</strong></p>
<p>Which is 1,618 ft high.</p>
<p>$3,468 face value</p>
<p>$2,063 melt value</p>
<hr />
<p>if you can find more reliable numbers for the yield stress of zinc, then I can update the numbers. Zinc really isn't used in load bearing situations, so there's not much structural info on it. If someone could get the yield stress for the zinc they use in pennies that would be even better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You must define crushed. Pennies are metal, making them ductile instead of brittle. To answer this question perfectly you would have to know the following</p>
<ol>
<li>What year is the penny from, as the composition has changed over the years from copper to a mix of other metals and alloys.  This will change the bottom penny's resistance to strain due to different modules and the weight each penny will supply to the stack would be different.</li>
<li>Temperature, because if it is cold enough, the penny would in fact become brittle and crush instead of smooshing into a thinner piece of material.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understood your math in a theoretical term (where each and every penny above the bottom penny is in perfect condition and is not being crushed itself by the penny above. but...</p>
<p>Curious question, since the bottom penny will be the &quot;most crushed&quot; and will have a largest diameter than the original, wouldn't the successive pennies above the bottom one begin to be crushed too? will form some sort of cone shape penny tower!(in reality).</p>
<p>If this occurs, wouldn't the consistent force acting down on the very bottom penny by displaced ever so slightly as you climb the mile high stack of pennies?</p>
<p>I'm having difficulties trying to see how this plays out on the bottom penny. Can anyone elaborate if it has any affect at all?</p>
<p>thanks!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
