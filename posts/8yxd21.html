<p>There's some misinformation in this thread but most people have the gist of it.</p>
<p>Most modern lines will use lengths of continuously welded rail (CWR), where you can have miles of rail before there is any physical gap. This length of rail would normally be subject to large amounts of thermal expansion but because the rails are rigidly held to the sleepers, it isn't able to move. This instead builds up high thermal forces within the rail, which if weren't controlled, would eventually lead to the rail buckling in high temperatures and cracking due to contraction in cool temperatures.</p>
<p>To combat this, the rail is prestressed when laid. The amount of stress applied is designed to put the rail in a stress free zone at the average rail temperature throughout the year. In the UK, this Stress Free Temperature (SFT) is 27C.</p>
<p>Expansion joints are still used when transferring from CWR track into standard jointed track to allow for some thermal expansion at the end of the welded section.</p>
<p>In addition to carefully stressing the rail, the threat of buckling is mitigated by ensuring sufficient lateral resistance of the track - normally through maintaining the ballast shoulder (ballast being the stones that the track is normally laid within).</p>
<p>When the temperature exceeds a Critical Rail Temperature (a value roughly 30C above the SFT), there is a risk of buckling. At this point, line speeds are normally reduced as this lowers the lateral loads imparted on the track by passing trains and makes it less likely to buckle.</p>
<p>Jointed track is far less susceptible to buckling as the rail is designed to allow for thermal expansion and contraction between the joints (typically 22 yards). However, there are huge disadvantages in using jointed track for high speed, high tonnage lines which is why they are rarely used for that purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_(rail_transport)#Joining_rails" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_(rail_transport)#Joining_rails</a></p>
<p>Generally, these are being phased out but this technology has served the railways in India for over a century (in a climate where the sun would cook the rails to high temperatures during the day).</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that the gap causing the ride to be &quot;clickety clack&quot; and increased wear as train wheels literally jump between tracks thousands of times a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We use expansion joints, similar to this one: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_joint#/media/File:Expansion_joint,_Hayle.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion\_joint#/media/File:Expansion\_joint,\_Hayle.jpg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion\_joint#/media/File:Expansion\_joint,\_Hayle.jpg</a></a></p>
<p>That will allow the metal to expand and shrink depending on the temperature</p>
<p>There is expansion joints all around you guys, there are most of time unnoticed by the civilians.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rails are pre-tensioned when they are laid. The ties (sleepers in the civilised world) keep the rails in tension. As the temperature falls, tension increases. As temperature rises, the tension decreases. The system is designed so the rails never experience a compressive force.</p>
<p>It's possible to lay rails in tension over many tens of kilometers, so that's what we do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the old days, with timber sleepers (or ties) between the rails, and iron spikes to hold the rails on, the rails came in short lengths, and would be connected end-to-end with plates and bolts. The holes in the rail and plates are larger than the bolts, allowing the joint to open and close as the rail expands.</p>
<p>These days, they deal with it using brute force, instead. They use steel or concrete sleepers, much stronger systems to hold the rails to the sleepers, and lengths of rail hundreds of meters long, and welded together. This forces the rails to stretch or compress with temperature changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
