		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary thing that affects your muscles with a warm up is blood flow.  </p>
<p>At rest, most of your skeletal muscles receive very little blood flow, because they aren't doing anything, they just kind of sit there.  When you do a <em>proper</em> warm up, those muscles start to need more substrates (oxygen, triglycerides, glycogen/glucose, proteins, all kinds of stuff).  In order to deliver those substrates, your body pumps more blood to those muscles.  That's the major thing that happens to your muscles during/after a <em>proper</em> warm up.  </p>
<p>As for the injury, think of your muscles as being like a sponge.  Before a <em>proper</em> warm up, your muscles are like a dried out sponge.  They are stiff, rigid, and prone to do things like crack and break, just like a really dry sponge.  When you warm up your muscles &quot;soak up&quot; that blood, and like a sponge that soaks up a bunch of water, they get soft and flexible, and instead of cracking or breaking under strain, they bend and flex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If by &quot;warm up&quot; you mean stretching, it doesn't. The most relevant effect is not on muscles, but on ligaments, and people who always stretch have the same injury rate as people who always don't.</p>
<p>A higher injury rate appears when switching from one regimen to the other, because lax ligaments need different handling than those not stretched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question is likely multifactorial. While blood flow is likely important in that the necessary ingredients are present, other factors are likely involved underlying a &quot;warm up&quot;. Alpha motor neurons instruct the muscle to contract while other muscle organs such as the muscle spindle and golgi tendon organs monitor rate rate of muscle length change and muscle tension, respectively. This is important because rapid muscle contraction may cause reflex spasm, and potentially, yes, injury. By 'warming up', these muscle organs that monitor changes in rate and tension become, for lack of a better word, primed and less likely to reflexively contract. A simple example to illustrate this is the colloquial reflex: you strike your patellar tendon and your knee jerks. The sensory input of rapid tendon shortening (spindle) causes the extensor compartment of your thigh to contract. If you push slowly into the tendon, bobkis.
Remember that micro injury is the goal of working out. The muscle heals stronger than before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tldr: Pre-excersise stretching/warmup doesn't help reduce injuries</p>
<p>I suspect that <del>every</del> nearly every reply posted so far falls back to the conventional way of thinking that stretching helped prevent injuries. While i can't speak to any of the very real physiological changes that happen during stretching, those changes don't appear to do anything to prevent injuries.  A 1999 article in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10593217/" target="_blank">link</a> analyzed multiple studies to determine that stretching didn't reduce injury rates in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Relevant Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;RESULTS: Three (all prospective) of the four clinical articles that suggested stretching was beneficial included a cointervention of warm-up. The fourth study (cross-sectional) found stretching was associated with less groin/buttock problems in cyclists, but only in women. There were five studies suggesting no difference in injury rates between stretchers and nonstretchers (3 prospective, 2 cross-sectional) and three suggesting stretching was detrimental (all cross-sectional). The review of the basic science literature suggested five reasons why stretching before exercise would not prevent injuries. First, in animals, immobilization or heating-induced increases in muscle compliance cause tissues to rupture more easily. Second, stretching before exercise should have no effect for activities in which excessive muscle length is not an issue (e.g., jogging). Third, stretching won't affect muscle compliance during eccentric activity, when most strains are believed to occur. Fourth, stretching can produce damage at the cytoskeleton level. Fifth, stretching appears to mask muscle pain in humans.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: The basic science literature supports the epidemiologic evidence that stretching before exercise does not reduce the risk of injury.&quot;</p>
