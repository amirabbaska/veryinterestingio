<p>The stomach doesn't digest the food though. The stomach has the essential enzymes for protein digestion (Pepsin, Kathepsin) which cracks the polypeptides in small digestable chains. Fat basically just passes through the stomach but get made more liquidous through peristaltic. Carbohydrates are also just passing the stomach since the enzymatic digestion of the alpha(1-4)glycosidbinding of amylose through alpha-Amylase gets inhibited through the low ph Value of the stomach.
Which is the next function of the stomach. It inhibits the growth of a lot of harmful microorganisms.</p>
<p>The stomach passes the &quot;mash&quot; to the intestine. The pylorus takes care that everything stays long enough in the stomach so that it get &quot;worked up&quot; enough and supply the intestine slow and continously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great posts about the pylorus in here. I'd like to add that the pylorus only allows passage of things smaller than 2 mm in diameter, meaning that food will be mostly homogenous when it hits the small instestine. </p>
<p>The only exception to this is when the gastrointestinal tract makes so-called moving-motor-complexes, a sort of cleaning program for the tract. This happens in short intervals after fasting for approximately 8 hours. That is the only way to rid the stomach of small fragments of plastic that you might have eaten. If you never faste for 8 hours straight (some people like to eat small meals frequently), these fragments can back up in the stomach indefinitely, so remember to take a break from eating every now and again. These moving-motor-complexes are not well understood at all, so there may be more to them than just emptying large particles from the stomach. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is more of a batch process, and empties into the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter, which is a musculature gate-keeper so the stomach doesn't dump its contents too quickly. The time of gastric emptying into the small intestine varies slightly but usually is complete in just over an hour. Up to four hours for an empty stomach. So it is a batch, but a batch that takes anywhere from 1-4 hours to complete, depending on the person, batch content and medical status.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The intestines have neurons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system" target="_blank">just like the brain</a>. IThe help regulate gastric and pancreatic secretion, as well as cause you to vomit when you get food poisoning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most interesting but not necessarily most helpful answer is regarding the scientific process to understand digestion. </p>
<p>Beaumont published a series of studies on a man named Alexis st. Martin after Martin was accidentally shot at close range with a musket. The injury healed to form a gastrocutaneous fistula which is basically a window into the stomach. He would dunk pieces of food in on a string and time the process of digestion and note what it looked like when he pulled it out. </p>
<p>Pretty amazing stuff. </p>
<p>I think Pavlov also created gastric fistulas for some of his experiments. </p>

<p>TL;DR: 1833 scientist dunked food on a string in other dudes stomach through a hole in his abdomen to learn how digestion works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
