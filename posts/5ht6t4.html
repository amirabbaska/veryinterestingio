		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saying &quot;light can't escape&quot; a black hole is true, but it doesn't really capture the reality of what's going on.</p>
<p>A black hole is a region in spacetime with so much mass concentrated into such a small volume that it warps space and time to the point where they essentially switch places. Outside, in the normal, flat-ish universe, space is a fixed coordinate grid, and time flows inexorably forwards. Inside a black hole, time stops, and <em>space</em> flows unstopably towards the singularity.</p>
<p>Put another way, the singularity isn't a point in space at the &quot;center&quot; of a black hole, it is a point in the future. The event horizon is defined as the radius within which all of your possible futures end at the singularity. Once you are within the event horizon, <em>there is no direction you can turn which is out</em>. All directions are in, towards the singularity in your future. In fact, if your goal is to survive as long as possible, your best move is just to free fall. Because the singularity is in every direction, any attempt to accelerate in any direction only gets you there sooner than had you done nothing at all. There is literally no way out without going backwards in time.</p>
<p>With this being said, it is difficult to envision any object with properties that allow it to escape, unless it inherently travels backward in time, which tends to violate cause and effect, and so is not generally expected to exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing beeing able to escape a black hole is a result which very beautifully can be derived in GR. You can define Events (time coordinate &amp; space coordinate) in spacetime to have a distance, which keeps track of spacial and temporal displacement. This distance measure assigns spacial distance a positive and temporal distance a negative sign. Two events thus may have a positive, null, or negative 'distance' between each other. If you wanted to calculate the mean velocity which an object would need to travel between two events, a positive distance between the events would imply a velocity &gt; c, null distance means velocity = c and negative distance Implies velocity &lt; c. </p>
<p>We call these distances space-time intervals and name them space-like for &gt; 0, time like for &lt; 0 and null or light like for = 0.
Here comes the important point: you can show that if a thing moves along a time-like path it can never switch to move along a light-like or space-like path, same goes for the other two paths. </p>
<p>Any point mass now has a certain radius called schwarzschild-radius where the signs in front of the temporal and radial components of the metric change. This means that an object that was traveling along a time-like path outside that radius now always needs to ensure that it's spacial displacement towards the center is positive and greater than its temporal displacement. Its' movement basically is confined to a path towards the center. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of a subtle question. It is conceivable (though definitely not expected, even by me who works in that direction) that Lorentz invariance is only an approximate symmetry of nature.</p>
<p>In this scenario what we currently call black holes would be escapeable. However the definition of black holes can be extended in this case, by following the spirit if not the letter of the definition, an inescapable regions can still exist, and they would always exist (making some standard assumptions) within a region we currently would call a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
