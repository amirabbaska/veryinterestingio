		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rabies infection has 3 periods:</p>
<p>(1) Incubation for 20-90 days (no symptoms)</p>
<p>(2) Prodromal period for 2-10 days (fever, pain, itchiness, numbness, etc.)</p>
<p>** Prodromal is an early symptom (or set of symptoms) that might indicate (show) the start of a disease before specific symptoms (for that disease) occur.</p>
<p>(3) Acute neurological (brain related) period for 2-7 days </p>
<p>Acute neurological period:</p>
<p>Symptoms include muscle fasciculations (twitches), priapism (persistent painful erection), and focal or generalised convulsions (seizures of part or all of the body, respectively). Patients may die immediately or may progress to paralysis , which may be present only in the bitten limb at first but usually becomes diffuse (spreads to all the body).</p>
<p>Furious rabies may develop during this period. Patients develop agitation, hyperactivity, restlessness, thrashing, biting, confusion, or hallucinations. &lt;----------------------- (((The confusion and hallucinations are what causes a person to fear water in addition to throat muscles being compromised making swallowing difficult.)))</p>
<p>After several hours to days, these symptoms come and go with calm, cooperative times in between. Furious episodes last less than 5 minutes. Episodes may be triggered by visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli or may be spontaneous. Seizures may occur. This phase may end in cardiorespiratory arrest (heart and lung faliure) or may progress to paralysis.</p>
<p>(Disclosure: Non of the above is medical advice, if you think you or someone you know has been bitten by an infected animal go to the closest ER).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has really explained the specifics of how rabies leads to the inability to swallow and the subsequent fear of water so I'll give it a go.</p>
<p>Rabies causes inflammation in the brain and the meninges (protective layer around the brain). There is a cranial nerve, located in the medulla, called the glossopharyngeal that is important for throat and tongue sensation and movement. When it becomes damaged we lose the ability to swallow. This is why people infected with rabies foam at the mouth, they literally cannot swallow their own saliva. </p>
<p>The fear of water, or hydrophobia, is caused by the pain of not being able to quench your thirst. Attempting to drink water would result in painful muscle spasms as your throat tried to swallow but ultimately lacks the ability to do so. You continue to produce saliva because biting is the most effective way for the virus to be transferred to another person. In fact if people/animals with rabies were able to swallow, the rate of transmission would be reduced drastically.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The virus affects the entire body, and especially hits us neurologically. What happens when you're thirsty and you see water? You salivate in anticipation of relieving that thirst. Salivation leads to swallowing, lest we drool. Well for someone in the later stages of rabies, swallowing becomes a very painful act...and as with anything painful, the mind tends to not want to repeat the act that leads to the pain. The Rabies virus causes severe muscle spasms in the throat, and even the sight of water can set them off. If that were happening to you, wouldn't you be 'afraid' of water, too?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to also add that not only does it hurt to swallow, but patients are forced to drink water after showing signs of rabies because rabies is partially spread in saliva. After a few sips of water it washes away the saliva contamination making it easier to treat patients. But in return making it difficult to swallow anything, it also causes vomiting, muscle contractions and convulsions, including the thought of seeing water as a threat neurologically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a fear of water, but the symptoms which come with trying to drink that we see in these videos. The patient initially tries to drink water, or some other fluid, and once the symptoms progress to hydrophobia, the patient is simply unwilling to undergo the side effects of attempting to swallow. </p>
<p>The gag reflex is constantly stimulated, and even saliva can cause a major reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
