		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The detonations that take place in the cylinders can only do so while the engine is spinning. When you stall an engine by overloading it you stop the rotation of the crank, stopping the pistons from moving up and down and stopping the sequence of events that leads to more combustion cycles. Even in modern e.f.i. Engines there is sensors tell the injectors when to fire. There won't just keep shooting fuel into a cylinder that isn't cycling anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've powered out diesel tractors before when a grade gets unexpectedly steep for the load. They will try to pull right to the very last, and as the RPM drops the governor opens up, injecting the maximum amount of fuel. However, when even a full charge of diesel doesn't develop enough power to accelerate the load, the motor starts slowing down.</p>
<p>As long as the crank keeps turning fast enough to compress and ignite the diesel, it will fire and keep turning over. If we are talking about an old air breathing diesel, this can be a very low speed. Black smoke will puff from the exhaust in distinct clouds as each cylinder fires, with a &quot;poof poof poof&quot; sound reminiscent of an old steam train. As the motor slows, it falls further out of the powerband and develops less and less torque.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the motor is going too slow, and the heat of compression is not enough to ignite the diesel anymore. This is when it comes to a sudden stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is an automatic with a torque converter the engine will just keep spinning but the car will not move. </p>
<p>The engine will stick at the stall speed of the torque converter which is usually around 2500 rpm. </p>
<p>If it is a manual transmission the wheels will lose traction or the engine will stop running. </p>
<p>Abruptly stopping an engine is bad for internals. They need to spin down freely to maintain life expectancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an overloaded engine, the explosion still occur normally. The explosion cause the mixture to heat up, which cause an increase in pressure. This force the piston down. When the engine is overloaded, that pressure just can't push enought on the piston. Then the gas start to cool and the pressure drop, thru press less against the piston. All that energy that would have been used to push on the piston had nowhere to go, part of it will go in the cylinder walls, which will be cooled by the cooling system, air on small engine, liquid on bigger ones. This excess of heat can also cause the engine to overheat. The extra pressure also cause lots of stress on the engine.</p>
<p>Normally the explosion take time to spread inside the mixture, which spread the power stroke over a wider motion range of the piston, helping to reduce the force applied, while giving out more of the usable energy. By overloading the engine, the power stroke ends up in a more limited portion of the stroke and you also lose efficiency, thru less power out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a manual transmission, the engine will likely stall. If you have an auto, the engine will keep trying but the torque converter will get hot real quick. That's why if you're pulling something, you want to stay out of overdrive in order to keep heat down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
