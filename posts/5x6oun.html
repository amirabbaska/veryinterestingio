<p>Sometimes it's impossible to tell. But most times it can be sleuthed out by examining the site specifics such as the fuel type, accessibility, any evidence or signs left behind. The indices of the day are an important tool, they help us understand the likelihood of ignition occurring. </p>
<p>If an arsonist uses an incendiary device (time delayed ignition thingy) then there's going to be obvious evidence of this when personnel zero in on the origin site of the fire. At the origin, the fire is low intensity and doesn't burn hot enough to remove evidence like that. As the fire travels with the wind, it gains intensity and burns increasingly heavier fuels. But at the outset it's only really going to burn fine, flashy fuels. </p>
<p>If the fire originates in the ditch of a quad trail, it's typically chalked up as having been started by an exhaust clinger from a quad or side-by-side. I've seen cases of this where the operators have stuck around to own up to it and offer statements, as well as cases where they've taken off. Hell, I've arrived on a fire where a Polaris side-by-side had apparently over heated and was fully involved by the time we got there. </p>
<p>If the origin of the fire is downwind of a flare stack, typically there will be follow up with the operators at that work site if they weren't already involved. Occasionally, flare stacks will &quot;burp&quot; up some flaming bitumen bits and that'll cause a fire with the right indices. Or their flare will go out and they'll reignite it by shooting a flare pen/gun etc at it. This is illegal for obvious reasons. I've had to work on such a fire. Idiotic. </p>
<p>When it's lightning caused it's fairly easy to figure out. There's typically a blown up/burnt /scarred tree at the origin site. Our province does a pretty good job keeping track of lightning activity and we know based on lightning frequency and indices how likely we are to see smoke puff up due to a lightning hold over. </p>
<p>Sometimes fires are due to abandoned campfires and these are beyond obvious to identify. </p>
<p>Burn piles left unattended (think farms, industrial lots such as forestry slash and such) can occasionally creep off and lead to wildfire. These are easy to tell. </p>
<p>When a downed powerline is the cause, again, it speaks for itself. </p>
<p>For the human caused fires, often there are witnesses. In these cases it helps a lot to remove any guess work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire burns up hills (grades) and not down them, and it burns with the wind and not against it.  I have worked fires that were tens of thousands of acres, and if you just walk into the wind far enough, you will find the point of ignition - usually a campsite with a fire ring, or a stump with a bunch of cigarette butts laying around it.  Sometimes you can actually see the offending cigarette butt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some interesting answers here, but look at the common denominator: you have to know <em>where</em> it started.</p>
<p>If you have a witness, then you pretty much go from what they say started it.</p>
<p>From there, it's basically a guessing game. If they test something in the area and it comes up positive for whatever flammable chemical, then you blame it on that chemical, and it's arson if the chemical wasn't supposed to be there. If there is a campfire site in the area, then it's blamed on a campfire. If there are 4-wheeler trails in the area, you blame it on 4-wheelers. If there's a smoke stack upwind, then you blame it on that. Lightning strikes in the area and a blown tree are probably one of the more scientific findings.</p>
<p>Fire investigation is not nearly as sound of a science as it's been made out to be. Texas executed someone recently based on this false science, which begs the question of just how many investigations these fire investigators/wannabe detectives have broken. Imagine how there have been entire conventions and training programs that are basically just Joe Blow fire-fighters teaching their peers their uninformed hunches, labeled as hard fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't an arsonist just kick some dry leaves into a pile and then use a propane torch to start it?</p>
<p>I'm just spitballing here, but if they did it like that, there's no residue to speak of for a chemist to detect.  And if the criminal walks away with the device used, there's nothing to find (versus a cigarette butt or something).  </p>
<p>I always wondered about that, there's this enormous forest fire and you hear on the news how they traced it all the way back to a cigarette butt or something.  Always sounds near impossible to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Found the prospective arsonist!</p>
<p>Various ignition sources leave telltale chemical signatures.</p>
<p>As long as you know about the fire quickly you can narrow down where it started. Then forensic chemists head there and test for various residues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
