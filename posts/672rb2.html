		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every action you can do is done with the coordination of multiple parts of your brain. Your eyes, in particular, connect to many different parts themselves. </p>
<p>To read, you must track the text, interpret the symbols, interpret the words and grammar, consolidate that into meaning, and store that meaning. The part that tracks the text and controls your eye movements involves your muscles in a way that takes very little conscious effort. If you get distracted and that part of your brain doesn't get the order to stop reading, it will just keep going even if the other parts of your brain get interrupted. </p>
<p>Every part of your brain can only do one task at a time. Each part can do a different task, but they have to work together for complex tasks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So my PhD was kind of around this area. Can't give a clean answer, but can talk a bit about what might be happening in the brain. </p>
<p>First thing to know - this is largely based on experiments using a method for looking at what's going on in the brain called fMRI. Exactly what it does is beyond an ELI5 explanation (might be able to write one if anyone is interested), but you can use it to crudely figure out how hard areas of the brain are working at different points in time. Let's say that we have recorded this data for when someone is relaxing vs when they are reading a book. </p>
<p>There's a set of brain regions referred to as the &quot;Default Network&quot;. They seem to be doing more work specifically during awake relaxation than during reading, or any other mental task.</p>
<p>Folks have suggested that this might mean the default network is responsible for what's referred to as ‘undirected thought’ - in this example, let's call it ‘mind wandering’. Mind wandering tends to be thinking about yourself, recent memories, future plans etc. </p>
<p>This isn't the only explanation of what the default network does. It could also, for example, be making sure you're aware of what's going on around you - important for survival in a world that can be dangerous - but there are reasons to believe it is related to mind wandering based on evidence that I'd have to dig out my thesis to remember (being a bad scientist here, but I'm super lazy). </p>
<p>There's another set of brain regions that seem to be working harder during reading, or performing any other mental task, than during relaxation - let's call it the task network (it doesn't have a sexy name as far as I know). </p>
<p>The interesting thing about these networks is that they seem to exist in balance - if one is doing more work, the other is doing less. When you start doing something - reading, mental arithmetic etc - the task network starts working harder, and the default network chills out a bit. Vice versa when you finish what you're doing. </p>
<p>There's evidence that the point where you lose focus coincides with a shift in the balance between the networks, and the default network becomes dominant. </p>
<p>The interesting question then becomes why these changes in the balance happen, and this is not settled to my knowledge. All of this evidence doesn't tell us the why, but it does give us a potential starting point for some interesting research. </p>
<p>I realise that this doesn't explain why the task of reading continues despite the mind having wandered. I was all about the brain data, need an attention specialist to address that. </p>
<p>Caveat for the above - definitely a controversial area, so none of the above is intended to be presented as fact. </p>
<p>All of this is based on the research that was available up to a few years back, as I'm not in brain research any more this might be horribly dated now (anyone with more up to date knowledge feel free to call me out, appreciate references though). </p>
<p>Further reading: not aware of any really good non-technical summaries of this stuff, but I think Raichle who published the original work and named the Default Network wrote a good review article around 2011 if you're feeling brave. </p>
<p>(wrote this after coming back from the pub, may clean up tomorrow if the urge takes me, but see above re: lazy)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This works with counting too. I worked at a warehouse and frequently had to grab 10, 12, 46, 207 or whatever annoying number the customer ordered of small lug nuts. I was up to 8 out of 30 and I zoned out and started thinking about random things, mind wandering. When I came back to Earth I found myself on number 22 and counting. I was kind of in disbelief so I recounted and it was actually correct!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your mind tends to wander when you read something it could be for various reasons. If you dont read regularly on a daily basis then your mind will wander because it's used to other patterns. In most peoples daily life we only read for short periods of time, maybe a paragraph or two... road signs, McDonald's menu, etc..  So your mind parsing large amount of text at a time, will not be used to processing this message much text at a time. Also while you are reading part of your bra UK n goes into &quot;sleep mode&quot; so your sub conscious takes over...  </p>
<p>Also, if you have a bunch of other things to do, or some other daily routine, your brain tells you to f off it wants to wander to what it usually does (due to your conscious thought out of your control in some kinda asleep mode (I think my brain has like 37 different sleep modes)..</p>
<p>Anyways, your mind will also wander if your brain flags some interesting text as it is reading so u will start daydreaming about that subject instead of perhaps the scope of the text u are reading..  that is due to a.d.d type factors </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
