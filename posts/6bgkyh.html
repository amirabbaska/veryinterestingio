		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a diamond made entirely of carbon-14, which I understand undergoes beta minus decay into nitrogen-14, what will happen to its tetrahedrally bonded structure as individual carbon atoms decay, and are replaced by nitrogen atoms? </p>
<p>One idea I had was that the nitrogen escaped the structure leaving gaps in the lattice. If this occurs, would the diamond then conduct electricity, (given a significant proportion of the carbon had decayed) since some carbon atoms will be only bonded to 3 others, and will therefore have free electrons, similar to graphite? </p>
<p>Also, if the nitrogen were to escape, would it have to form nitrogen molecules as it does so (and therefore two adjacent carbon atoms would have to had decayed?), or would it leave the structure as singular nitrogen atoms? </p>
<p>Finally, could the nitrogen remain tetrahedrally bonded in the structure (forming four bonds to adjacent atoms rather than the usual three)? If so, after all of the atoms have decayed, what would you be left with? </p>
<p>Bonus question: would a diamond made of carbon-14 look any different to a regular diamond, i.e. refract light any differently? </p>
<p>Sorry this question is so long, but I'd be interested to find out what occurs, or if I have misunderstood the idea completely. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a naive stab at it: diamond is basically silicon in many, many ways.  They are both group IV atoms that form diamond lattices that result in semiconductors.  The real difference is that the bonding is stronger in diamond which is why silicon, as a semiconductor, has a bandgap of Si is 1.1 eV where diamond has one 5 times larger (5.5 eV).  Nitrogen, like phosphorous and arsenic, is an n-type dopant for a group-IV semiconductor. Thus, initially the diamond would behave just like a diamond that is becoming more and more n-type.  Electrical conductivity would increase exponentially with doping (i.e. conversion of C to N) but optical properties, to first order, would remain largely unaffected as the bandgap narrowing would be minimal.</p>
<p>However, there's a catch.  We don't actually use nitrogen as a dopant in silicon because of its very low solubility in Si.  What solubility means is that below the solubility limit, you basically have N playing nice with Si and basically it just takes the spot of an Si atom in the lattice but you still have an Si diamond lattice, just with the occasional N atom.  Beyond this solubility limit, the nitrogen begins to form its own separate phase.  So you no longer have N taking the place of Si, but rather separate regions of some nitrogen compound and silicon.  They separate.  At this point the material would start to behave like undoped diamond again with large defect grains whose average size increase as the average size of N precipitate grows.  However, I don't actually no the solubility of nitrogen in CARBON.  So that picture may change a lot, but regardless at SOME point you'll be past the solubility limit.</p>
<p>Beyond that I can't help you, as I'm a physicist not a chemist and things become more about chemistry at that point.  I don't know what precipitate nitrogen would form in diamond and I don't know if/when the material would crack or deform as the grain size of the N &quot;islands&quot; grew.</p>
<p>EDIT: The chemical symbol for nitrogen is N, not Ni, you think I would've remembered that....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen-vacancy_center" target="_blank">Nitrogen Vacancy Center</a> which is a Nitrogen atom replacing a C atom in a diamond next to a vacancy (missing C atom), so energy from the radioactive decay might promote the formation of such a vacancy (I don't know about the energies involved, so I cannot say how often this will happen).</p>
<p>With a half life of 5,730 years, C-14 will decay rather slowly, so any structural change is taken quite some time. So in the beginning the newly formed N will act as an dopant in diamond as /u/cantgetno197/ already explained, maybe also some N-V centers like I explained above. With higher and higher concentrations of N you would lose the &quot;diamond&quot;-character of your specimen, your C atoms would probably go towards the thermodynamically favored graphite structure. For the Nitrogen it is more favorable to be N2 (like in the air) compared to retaining the tetrahedal bonding of the diamond, but also the formation of some organic molecules like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine" target="_blank">amines</a> is possible (with enough H coming from the surrounding).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of people mentioned nitrogen vacancy centers, this is one type of &quot;color center&quot; in gemstones, where a strain defect in the crystal lattice causes visible color.  <a href="http://www.modernjeweler.com/web/online/Diamond-Gem-Profiles/Irradiated-Diamond/2$290" target="_blank">Diamonds are exposed to radiation to create these color centers, which makes them yellow or green</a>  This radiation doesn't change the elemental composition of the stone, rather it kocks atoms loose in the crystal lattice, and hte strain causes color.</p>
<p>Topaz is commonly colored blue by this process.  &quot;sky blue&quot; topaz is bombarded by electrons, &quot;Swiss blue&quot; by gamma rays, and &quot;London Blue&quot; topaz is exposed to neutrons from Cobalt-60, and it has to be sequestered for a while as the induced radioactivity decays.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamictization" target="_blank">Zircon naturally contains traces of uranium</a>, and internal radiation degrades the gem qualities.  &quot;High zircon&quot; has good hardness and excellent refractive index and dispersion, but after it ages (for around a billion years), it turns to &quot;low zircon&quot;, a softer stone with poorer optical properties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get a bunch of NV centres forming (also lots of structure damage from the beta decay, but ignoring that for now).  These NV centres are quite interesting as they absorb at optical frequencies and have lots of potential applications. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
