		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychologist and Suicide Counsellor. If you see the brain as a tool for solving problems then suicide is adaptive. Problems solved, pain ended.</p>
<p>I do not condone suicide - there is usually another option... But reading through this thread, maybe it's society that contributes to depression and suicide by shaming people who are down and out with labels like 'maladaptive'. No one is an island. I prefer to see thoughts of suicide as the last recourse of a mind trying to cope with a huge problem. People usually feel a bit better about their issues (and I think less likely to kill themselves) when they hear that.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies don't have &quot;goals&quot; per se, they are how they are because it has worked &quot;well enough&quot;. Of course our bodies tend toward efficiency because it tends to survive harsh times better, but the fact is that occasional depression and suicide are malfunctions at an acceptable level for the continuation and proliferation of the species. Evolutionarily speaking the individual is irrelevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist, but I have battled anxiety disorder in the past and learned enough about anxiety and depression to give an educated answer on this! </p>
<p>It all has to do with human nature and it's relationship with environment. I know that sounds vague, but stick with me...</p>
<p>Humans, as hunters and gathereres, had a drive for survival that was constant--running from dangerous animals, hunting animals, gathering food, procreating, etc. A lot of natural stimulation. </p>
<p>But, as civilization is now, many people have easy access to food, aren't running from anything and have rooted stimulus in things like television, music, sex, social environments, etc. </p>
<p>With complex society comes a lot of social constructs that are abstract ... made up, to put it lightly. </p>
<p>You have to have a car, a wife, a job, a kid, money, happiness exterior to your desk job, friends, a successful favorite football team, a cool hobby, etc. </p>
<p>We don't actually HAVE to have these things, but in a life where we aren't in immediate danger or starving our brains begin using these arbitrary social constructs and reacting to them chemically. </p>
<p>With anxiety disorder, the central issue is that sufferers enter the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response for things like...idk...not getting a text from a crush after texting them, or misinterpreting something your boss said, or not having money. Our body reacts the same way it would if you were backed into a corner by a bear, but there's no actual danger. </p>
<p>Depression is the other edge of the sword. We can get overstimulated too fast because of the complexity of our society. Remember your first roller coaster ride? Think about all the emotions you felt beforehand, right? Now think about how you would feel if you rode one each day for your entire life. Eventually the feelings of anxiousness subside. It's kind of like how birthdays were awesome as a kid, but eventually they're just...bleh. We live lifestyles where repetition and routine can leave us surrounded in a world that we find, eventually, not interesting at all. This is why people with seemingly no &quot;major issues&quot; end up depressed. Also, we put a lot of worth in other things, so that when we lose them it's depressing. Example: at 13 my Dad took my Xbox away. I was actually depressed for weeks. </p>
<p>When we get to more complex things like breakups, or losing a job, or a friend, or financial trouble, we lose our sense of self worth. That's not right...we are all very lucky to live in the time and place we do, so ironic it is that we get jaded and self deprecating so easily. </p>
<p>And social media is a category in itself. We are operating in a daily lifestyle where there's constant need for recognition and we are constantly comparing ourselves to others. </p>
<p>TL;DR -- our fight or flight instincts are not compatible in a modern lifestyle, so our brains literally recalibrate to our surroundings -- often with unhealthy results </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suicide is more like a solution to a problem than self destruction per se.</p>
<p>I used to suicidal....so I can tell you it becomes something we fanatsize about. Something we look forward to. In a way.....I guess we don't see it as death.....just as a solution.</p>
<p>We go over solutions in our head and that is the one the solution that surely &quot;works.&quot;</p>
<p>And if we get sad we think &quot;well....I know suicide will work for sure....&quot;</p>
<p>Our survival instincts kick in when we go to kill ourselves. I tried twice in my life.....and both times scared the shit out of me. </p>
<p>Every person who has killed themselves regretted the moment it was too late....remember that.</p>
<p>I tried to kill myself at 16....and again at 22....</p>
<p>I'm 27 now....and had I died I would have been missing out on some of the most wonderful things life can offer.</p>
<p>I'm not a psychologist.....but I figure I would chime in with my personal experience anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
