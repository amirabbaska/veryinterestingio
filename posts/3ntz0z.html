I was also thinking that millions of years ago, their ancestors were tiny, but still hunted prey relative to their size, however as their prey started growing, they to, will grow over time as only stronger cats would be able to bring down the prey and therefore pass on the genetics. However with the case of the gorillas as some people mentioned, how did they evolve to be strong, with really no motive to be as powerful as they are?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much of what is being discussed is correct and true, but the original question and many of the answers are trying to answer in metaphor or comparisons to himans, and what human athletes vs regular humans do etc.   but I want to throw out there that a jaguar is built like a jaguar because that's how jaguars are built.  Bear with me.</p>
<p>A jaguar has a certain genetic makeup, a certain environment that it both evolved and then grew to maturity in.  It has a certain physiology, a life cycle, certain microbiome, diet, etc...</p>
<p>A wild jaguar doesn't have to lift weights to be powerful and muscular: it just has to be born to otherwise fit jaguar parents and then live the life of a healthy, well fed jaguar.  It grows up, tussle with siblings, roams a territory, hunts, climbs trees, swims, etc. and it's evolutionary history ensures that that is enough to maintain it's physiological capabilities.   Deer are fleet, and wolves are dogged, and they have shaped each other that way.  But, deer and wolves are not the same, and neither are people and jaguars.</p>
<p>If you look at a zoo lion, you are looking at a very different lion than a wild lion, too, because the zoo lion doesn't get to do what a wild lion does, eat what they eat, etc.  A wild lion roams miles and miles daily, fights on a pretty regular basis, chases off hyenas, and kills things to eat.  A zoo lion may live longer, but is body won't react well to the sedentary life of a zoo.  He will be less muscular, even if he is not fat, etc...</p>
<p>Modern people in the western world are more like a zoo lion.  Watch a documantsrtly about humans living a normal, pre-industrial life, like our ancestors did, whether that is hunter-gatherer, subsistence farming, or following your cattle all over.  Look at guys from Papua New Guinea, or Africa, or SE Asia, guys who do normal hard work, lots of walking, hoeing and planting, shooting bows or whatever other cultural pursuits, hunting, maybe make a little war, etc...  that is more or less what a NORMAL human physique looks like.  Sure the Amazonians are stockier than most Africans, or whatever, but those broad chested tribesmen with thick legs and arms from Trobriand Islands don't lift weights, they just live life.  Likewise, the San Bushmen, the guys who run antelope to death, they don't train, don't run intervals, or do progressive distance training, etc.  They just walk a lot, run as part of daily life, and don't gain that extra 30 lbs, sitting behind a desk.</p>
<p>That's how jaguars do it.  Evolution and lifestyle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise isn't necessary to build muscle. The human body is programmed to only build muscle if you seem to need it. Exercise tricks the body into building more muscle. Animals that are pre-programmed to build muscle by default can build muscle without exercising. As an extreme example of this, there are mutant cattle that lack the gene that makes the body get rid of muscle:

Humans are evolved to prioritize having low energy needs over being super strong. In our evolutionary history, food was scarce, and didn't require a lot of strength to acquire. Growing bigger muscles made us need more calories so our bodies became programmed to only grow muscle if we seemed to really be using them a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you question how they build muscle, yet mention the fact that they sleep a lot. Sleep is good for recovery and building muscle in that  sense, don't mistake it for the more sleep an animal get equals the more lazy it gets.  </p>
<p>And yeah top comment nails it especially on the fact that there was no need to build more muscle as even if we built more muscle I doubt that we can manhandle prey like that and still have a body type to support a big brain. We had weapons to finish off prey so there was a huge incentive NOT to build muscle as they provide little return for a lot of energy spent.  </p>
<p>I do wonder though why more muscular humans didn't thrive in hunting sense, as they could be more explosive and faster and therefore close the distance quicker and try to end the chase there therefore saving energy as to if you took a leaner distance runner who would expend more energy over a long distance.  </p>
<p>Maybe the speed wasn't that impactful as other pure predators on four legs were the only ones able to reach much higher speeds and have an acceptable success rate with it. And yeah thinking about it more I highly doubt that even the fastest human back then could outrun a short-burst predator, so they have to go with the long-run strategy which is the best one since they would have little to no success with genes that produced short-burst humans.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember: lions are not humans!</p>
<p>Every creature has an natural level of muscle, and humans really have a low natural level of muscle which makes it look weird if other animals are really ripped without a lot of exercise. It is more about humans being skinny because we dont NEED a lot of muscle. and they have a normal amount of muscle.</p>
<p>We humans have evolved into having LESS muscle. Which is also why we need to excercise so much to gain muscle. But even if you didnt exercise you would be left with some muscle.</p>
<p>The amount of muscle you will have when not exercising is genetically determined. And for the big cats that is quite a lot. IF a human would follow the same excercise pattern as a lion the results would be really poor (no it wont turn you into usain bolt)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
