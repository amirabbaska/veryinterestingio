		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very slowly, generally someone will spell it out, and after spelling it a couple times, make a new sign indicating what it is. </p>
<p>IE: my deaf friend does a &quot;fidget spinner&quot; by holding her thumb and index finger together with one hand and drawing the index finger of her other hand down in front of this. </p>
<p>Eventually a sign spreads and becomes integrated into the language. This is also how &quot;regional&quot; signs are made to represent things in their community, be it a college, popular city, sports team, etc. People outside of the region won't know what the sign means, of course, so they'll just ask what they mean. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes very naturally. If somebody gave you a fidget spinner before you ever knew what it was and asked you to come up with a name for the thing, you probably wouldn't have too much trouble coming up with something, simply using all the subconscious knowledge about your native language and its word building. So SL users just name things out of the top of their heads, usually based on the visual properties of the things or concepts.</p>
<p>Another question is then, how do these new signs spread and become common? Well that's a different stroy and, as Atlas_Rising has mentioned, it usually happens slowly and begins with the new sign being regional only.</p>
<p>No matter the type of a language, the incorporation of new words depends heavily on how may people have access to the new word. If a group of friends came up with a word and only used it between themselves, the word will probably just stay within the group. But if they start, for example, using hashtags and letting other people find out about this new word, chances are, it will spread and in some time, it will become just a regular everyday word.</p>
<p>One of the fastest ways for new sings to become common is news in SL. In most countries of the world, deaf people are still struggling when it comes to getting information in their native language, so if there are any news in sign language, be it on the internet or on broadcast TV, most people will watch it. So when the news caster or, in some cases, the SL interpreter introduces new sign, it spreads super fast.</p>
<p>Another great way are all sorts of social media. For example, I live in a very small country and there's only around 8000 deaf people in the whole country. They've got their open Facebook group where they discuss all kinds of topics, just uploading videos stating their opinions. And the group is very large, almost everybody is there. That's a great way for the whole community to pick just one sign out of all the individual ones that people came up with at first on their own. I've noticed that sometimes a signer would fingerspell and/or use a few different signs for the new concept they've already seen in the group, and the number of synonyms would just drop in every following video till only one or two are left. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As Atlas said, you kind of create the words yourself, it might not be universal though. I have two of my sisters that are deaf, so for ISIS, we just spell it I S I S, and they get it. But when defining isis, we say to them it's a terrorist group with normal deaf language since these are more common words. Hope you understood it now, it's actually fun creating words with my sisters like those. We even make our own words that only our family understands, for example, we shape our hands as an ironing machine if we talk about ironing. It can be difficult at times but it's really fun</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
