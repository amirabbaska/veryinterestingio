		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel that the other answers are all missing some clarity, so I'll attempt my explanation here of <strong>The Standard Model</strong>.</p>
<p>As far as we know, all the matter that we can see in the Universe (ie: &quot;stuff&quot;) is made up of two types of particle: <strong>hadrons</strong> and <strong>leptons</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>hadron</strong> is a <em>composite</em> particle; they are composed of several other more <em>fundamental</em> particles: <strong>quarks</strong>.</p>
<p>We currently know there are 6 different types of quark (Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange and Charm) each very similar but with slightly different properties. As /u/Aelinsaar pointed out, quarks cannot exist on their own, so they group together in two's (<strong>mesons</strong>) or three's (<strong>baryons</strong>) (<del>and theoretical groups of five</del> and also less commonly, in groups of 4 and 5, as /u/mfb- points out below). <em>Protons</em> and <em>Neutrons</em> are baryons (which makes them hadrons), composed of Up and Down quarks only (2 up + 1 down and 1 up + 2 down, respectively). Protons and neutrons make almost the entirety of the visible Universe, and it's why we can refer to &quot;stuff&quot; as <em>baryonic matter</em>: stuff made of baryons.</p>
<p>There are many other types of baryon and meson formed by different combinations of quark, many of which can be studied in the LHC (a large collider of hadrons, or alternatively, a collider of large hadrons), but they are all &quot;exotic matter&quot;.</p>
<p>A <strong>lepton</strong> is a <em>fundamental</em> particle. There are six known leptons: three <em>charged</em> leptons (the <strong>electron</strong>, the muon and the tau) and three <em>neutral</em> leptons (the neutrino, the muon neutrino, the tauon neutrino). They are all very similar to each other, the main difference being that they are respectively <em>more massive</em> than the previous (the electron and the neutrino are the smallest of their groups).</p>
<p>So, these so far are all the <em>fundamental</em> particles of matter. Normal, everyday stuff is made of protons and neutrons (up and down quarks) and electrons. For all elements (except hydrogen) in their neutral state, that means a small, tight nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a large, diffuse &quot;cloud&quot; of electrons. This answers the main scope of OP's question, but I'll carry on for a bit more.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about anti-matter?</em></strong></p>
<p>Above is only half the picture. It turns out that all of the <em>fundamental</em> particles I mentioned have a corresponding <strong>anti-particle</strong>. All of the fundamental particles above have a property called &quot;charge&quot; (of electric charge) which can be positive or negative, and one of the things that differentiates some of those particles from the other is how much charge thy have. The easiest way to think about a particles anti-particle is that they are identical, except they have the opposite charge (this is not strictly true - neutrinos are neutral, so an antineutrino differs through a different property - the <em>lepton number</em> which I haven't gone into here, but you can look it up if interested). When a particle comes into contact with its anti-particle, they annihilate (they release a lot of energy). Anti-particles are created all the time in natural processes, but they annihilate almost immediately. A big open question in modern physics is why the Universe seems to be made of &quot;matter&quot; rather than &quot;anti-matter&quot;; we believe that when the Universe was created there were equal amounts of both.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about the photon? Isn't that a &quot;fundamental particle&quot;?</em></strong></p>
<p>I've gone over &quot;what stuff is made of&quot;. However, stuff needs to be able to &quot;interact&quot; with other stuff, otherwise what's the point? It turns out that the Standard Model also takes into account how stuff &quot;interacts&quot; with other stuff, and that's where the photon comes out.</p>
<p>There are four main ways that all the above matter interacts, known as the four <em>fundamental forces</em>. They are <strong>electromagnetism</strong>, <strong>gravity</strong>, <strong>strong force</strong> and <strong>weak force</strong>. Explaining properly how they fit into the Standard Model is a bit beyond ELI5 territory, involving some rather nasty an complicated maths and physics (gauge theory). However, it's not entirely incorrect to say that when particles interact with each other, they do so under one of these four forces, and that this interaction takes places as the exchange of a particle, called a <em>force carrier</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Electromagnetism</strong> is by far the most studied and well understood of the forces, and is the one everyone is most familiar with. It determines everything from the fact that the sun shines with light and heat to the fact that your fingers can &quot;come into contact&quot; with a wooden table instead of passing through. The force carrier is the <strong>photon</strong>, and all electromagnetic interactions can be said to involve the exchange of a photon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>strong force</strong> as mentioned by another user is the force that mediates how quarks interact with other quarks and holds them together into baryons and mesons. It is also responsible for holding together protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. The force carrier is the <strong>gluon</strong>, and all strong interactions can be said to involve the exchange of a gluon. The strong force is about 137 times stronger than electromagnetism (at very small scales)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>weak force</strong> is responsible for radioacive decay and nuclear fission. It's not often studied alone, but usually together with electromagnetism as they are very closely related. The force carriers are three: the <strong>W^+ boson</strong>, <strong>W^- boson</strong> and the <strong>Z^0 boson</strong>. It's thousands of times weaker than electromagnatism.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Gravity</strong> doesn't actually form part of the Standard Model. This is another Big Question in Physics: how to unify Gravity (whose main theory is General Relativity) with the Standard Model. The force carrier in this case is thought to be the <strong>graviton</strong>, but it's never been observed and some scientists debate it's existence at all. It is by far and large the absolute weakest of all the forces, billions and billions of times weaker than electromagnetism. Think about it: with your puny little hands you can lift something up, immediately and easily counteracting the gravitational pull of the entire planet Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What about the Higgs Boson</em></strong>?</p>
<p>Of all the fundamental particles I've mentioned (quarks, anti-quarks, leptons, anti-leptons and force carriers), the only one missing from the Standard Model is the <strong>Higgs Boson</strong>.  I won't go into much detail at all other than to say that it is another fundamental &quot;force carrier&quot; which we currently understand to be responsible for the mechanism by which all the other particles gain mass.</p>
<p><strong><em>What's this everyone else has mentioned about bosons and fermions?</em></strong></p>
<p>All of the mentioned particles have several intrinsic properties (although not all of them have them all). Some of the most common and that we are most familiar with are mass and charge (like electric). Turns out almost all of them have an intrinsic property called &quot;spin&quot;, which is related to the intrinsic angular momentum of each particle. The easiest way to visualise spin is to think of the particles actually spinning (although this is completely incorrect!). Spin can have a direction (up or down) as well as a magnitude (an &quot;amount&quot; of spin). This amount can come in half-integer values (1/2, -3/2, 5/2, etc) or integer values (0, -1, 2, etc).</p>
<p>Almost all particles have spin. <em>Composite</em> particles have a total spin which is the sum of the spin of their components. All quarks and leptons are &quot;spin-1/2 particles&quot;, which means they all have a spin of 1/2 or -1/2.</p>
<p>All particles with &quot;half-integer&quot; spin are <strong>fermions</strong>. All particles with &quot;integer spin&quot; are <strong>bosons</strong>.
The main and most important difference between fermions and bosons is that at low energy, they &quot;obey different statistics&quot;. What this means is that when you want to describe a collection of particles (which we often do) and you have to describe their behaviour statistically (because they are too many and too small and too similar to be described individually) you need to use different statistical methods to describe their behaviour (Fermi-Dirac statistics for fermions and Bose-Einstein statistics for bosons).  This leads to a big difference between fermions and bosons - the <em>Pauli Exclusion theory</em> which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same &quot;state&quot;, but two identical bosons can - which is a very important phenomenon in quantum physics.</p>
<p>Although all leptons and quarks are fermions, that is not the case for atoms. Depending on the amount of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, atoms can be either fermions or bosons. This means that sometimes different isotopes of the same element can have vastly different properties at low energies.</p>
<p>This was an overview of the Standard Model which obviously is missing out a <strong>LOT</strong>. However, I think I've covered almost all of the basics in an easy-to-understand manner. Please do let me know if something is unclear (or incorrect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right, so here's the deal since school:</p>
<p>The atom is composed of just what you said, but there is a strong indication that protons and neutrons are composed of more fundamental particles called Quarks, as you said. They're the constituents of a family of particles called Hadrons which are all of the particles which are dominated by the 'Strong' force/interaction (i.e. 'The Strong Nuclear Force you learned about, I would guess). In particular they're a subset of that family called Baryons, which are composed of three quarks, and Mesons of two quarks which we can ignore. </p>
<p>Now, quarks (at normal energies) can only exist in bound groupings; the force which binds them gets <em>stronger</em> as you try to &quot;pull them apart&quot;, to the point where instead of doing so, you input enough energy to create new bound sets of quarks and other particles. This is getting very non-ELI5, but I'll bring this back, I promise you.</p>
<p>So we have the basics: Hadrons are systems of bound quarks (the only way we get quarks), and protons and neutrons are a subset of Hadrons called Baryons. You can't study individual quarks, and if you try to break their bonds you just create new groups of bound quarks scattering around. So... why does this matter? Obviously in most of our lives, in chemistry, you can treat a proton as being fundamental.</p>
<p>Enter the LHC, the Large Hadron Collider, which discovered the Higgs Boson you may have heard about over the years. Now you may have some idea about what that name means, because you know that they must be &quot;colliding&quot; neutrons and/or protons. In fact they do, and at velocities <em>very</em> close to the speed of light, with truly drastic energies. </p>
<p>When these protons (beams of them really, but lets treat this individually) collide, they undergo something called scattering; scientists can study the tracks left by little subatomic particles which result from the process of trying to overcome the Strong interaction I talked about above. You don't get to see quarks, but you can see the evidence of interactions that are best described in terms of quarks. </p>
<p>As to why this matters... well... if you want to confirm existing physics or discover new physics, you need to explore new conditions (in this case very high energy levels). It's not easy; to paraphrase a much smarter person than me, it's like trying to study clocks and clockmaking by smashing clocks together and studying the pieces. </p>
<p>Except the pieces only exist for brief instants, and you can only study evidence of that existence, or infer it from math which says, &quot;If I start with 1 unit of energy, I must end with 1 unit, always&quot; followed by clever accounting from known sources. </p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and you asked about the Electron, which is a fundamental particle called a Lepton, which is not believed to have any constituent parts. That said, you probably learned about a model of the atom in which electrons were treated as discrete particles orbiting a nucleus; the &quot;billiard ball model&quot; which is so well loved and well known. Now that understanding has given way to the notion of energy levels and a probabilistic view of the electron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Super simplified just to give you something to grasp, read the others of you want more details. </p>
<p>Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. </p>
<p>Protons and neutrons are things called hadrons</p>
<p>Hadrons are made up of quarks, specifically 2 &quot;up&quot;s and 1 &quot;down&quot; all tied together with gluons</p>
<p>Fermions are just a category of subatomic particles. It includes quarks and even things made of quarks like neutrons. It also includes nonquark things, but thats the general idea</p>
<p>Bosons are the other category of subatomic particles. In my mind, these are more &quot;energy&quot; things. It includes photons and gluons</p>
<p>So quarks are the atom of atoms. Imagine all of those Styrofoam ball models you made in middle school being made of even smaller balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. That's still true.
Electrons are elementary particles, meaning there is nothing smaller, or nothing smaller that we know of, but protons and neutrons are made up of quarks. There are also other particles that are not in atoms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">The Standard Model</a> is our current model for particle physics. If you look at the table, you can see the different elementary particles and what they do. For example, Fermions are the &quot;mass&quot; particles, and the gauge bosons mediate 3 of the 4 fundamental forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as the search for theories that explain either the fundamental forces (strong nuclear, weak nuclear, electromagnetic, gravity) or the effects of the various fundamental properties (electrical charge, mass, spin, color, etc.).</p>
<p>Re-defining protons and neutrons to be formed of these quarks that have 6 flavors and &quot;color&quot; charge (similar to how the electron has electrical charge) allows quantum theory explanations of the weak (radioactive decay) nuclear force and the strong nuclear force, that mirror the quantum electrodynamics theory that describes electromagnetism, and allows for a unified (quantum) theory for 3 of the 4 fundamental forces of the universe.</p>
<p>Quantum gravity is still an issue; the force of gravity is still best explained in terms of deformed or warped spacetime, rather than an interaction between fundamental particles that's mediated by the &quot;graviton.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
