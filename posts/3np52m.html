		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything already said but I want to add something:
If I take my pill at 7am every day for a full cycle, I can predict when my period will start to the HOUR. If I take it between 6am and 9am (which is what usually happens), I can only predict it to a 36-hour window (more or less).
The pill administers a certain amount of hormone to last 24 hours, and the body gets used to the routine so that when the pills stop (i.e. one takes a week of white &quot;empty&quot; pills), the body immediately notices the change and starts prepping for a period. If they aren't taken 100% regularly, the body will hesitate to prepare for menstruation as it believes the hormones might just be delayed.
EDIT: I believe I take the combination-type pill, as I can take one of my pills up to 12 hours late and still be protected against pregnancy. I did not know about the other type of pill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>iirc, they actually don't need to be taken at exactly the same time everyday, it's just easier to remember if you have a set schedule. It's often recommended to take it at the same time to remember, e.g. after you brush your teeth, so therefore it stays in your routine and you make it a habit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to know is that there are broadly two types of birth control pill: progestin-only pills and combination pills, which contain both progestin and estrogen. Both types of pill work in fairly similar ways. </p>
<p>I’ll stay away from the arguments for and against each type of pill as that’s not relevant to the question but the short answer is that progestin doesn’t stay in the body very long and each dose is only effective for slightly more than 24 hours therefore “within 3 hours of your normal time” is used as a guideline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason you should space your drinks evenly: consistency of the buzz.  Shots too close together and your BAC goes above safe levels causing your date's stupid jokes to get funny.  Shots too widely spaced results in your BAC dropping low enough to regret swiping right.  So, taking your pill at the same time every day ensures that your anti-baby buzz remains at just the right level so you're best protected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As soon as a drug (in this case, artificial hormones) enters your body, your body starts to get rid of it, by dumping it in your urine or your feces. This means that the level of drug is highest shortly after you take the drug (once the drug gets from your stomach into your bloodstream), and then drops slowly over time, because a little of it is leaving your body all the time.<br />
In order to be effective, the drug has to be at a certain level in your blood. This level is called the &quot;therapeutic range.&quot; If it drops below that certain level it stops being effective. It it goes too high it starts to produce side effects and might even be toxic. The amount of drug in the pill is calculated so that, if taken at regular intervals, it never gets too high and it never gets too low, maintaining the amount of drug in your body within the therapeutic range. It takes a while to get the drug to this steady state, which is why they tell you not to count on the pill being effective the first two weeks you are taking it. The amount of drug has to build up in your blood stream.<br />
Say you take one pill at 8 am and the next pill at Noon. After the second pill gets from your stomach into your blood stream, the level of drug will be too high (above the therapeutic range) for a while, until your body gets rid of the excess.<br />
Or, say you take one pill at 8 AM one day, and then don't take the next one until 8 PM the following day. So now 36 hours have elapsed between pills. During some of the time before you take that second pill, the levels of the drug in your body might be too low, below the therapeutic range, possibly leaving you unprotected against pregnancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
