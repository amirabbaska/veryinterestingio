<p>The earliest known dinosaurs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguanodon" target="_blank">iguanodons</a> went through a few different permutations of what we thought they looked like. </p>
<p>Dinosaurs were commonly depicted standing more vertically in the past too. </p>
<p>However, as to the overall shape, they aren't all that different to animals today. They safely assume the thigh bone is connected to the hip bone and build from there once you've found a moderately complete fossil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they were first found, people had no idea they were the skeletal remains of extinct species from 65+ million years ago.  However, ancient people definitely were able to tell they were the skeletal remains of some strange animals.</p>
<p>In many cultures, these remains gave rise to legends like dragons - since the remains looked an awful lot like lizards, crocodiles and other critters they knew, but way, way bigger - so it was a logical assumption.</p>
<p>Other mythical explanations arose as well, such as legends of the mammut from Siberia - a huge creature with tusks like a walrus that lived underground.  If it came into sunlight, it turned to stone and died.  Not a bad explanation for mammoth bones found eroding out of the tundra.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the Enlightenment that anatomists like Georges Cuvier were able to look at the fossils in detail, and realize that they had similarities to modern animals, but also important differences.  Using his knowledge of how modern animals were put together, he was able to come up with pretty accurate reconstructions of how these critters would have actually looked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Fossils are usually crushed and warped, but when you find something like <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/10/13/dino.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, it gives you a pretty good picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In ancient times dinosaur bones fuelled mythology. In Asia there are many <a href="http://research.amnh.org/paleontology/f/25.jpg" target="_blank">beautifully preserved fossils</a>, and they were (and are still in some places) sold as <a href="http://paleo.cc/ce/chinese-dragon2.jpg" target="_blank">dragon bones</a> for medicinal purposes. Not too bad an interpretation really! Doesn't seem that much further from the truth than the classic early iguanodon reconstruction. Many fossils, like that picture of meilong the 'sleeping dragon', were so well preserved there wasn't a question of which bones went where or how the animal might have looked, though it should be noted that it isn't just ancient reptiles that fell under the label of 'dragon' this way, any fossil got the same treatment. <a href="http://www.mhhe.com/socscience/anthropology/image-bank/kottak/chap06/kot37055_0607ta.jpg" target="_blank">Gigantopithecus </a> is known from a tooth found in a shipment of 'dragon bones' in much more recent years.</p>
<p>Other misinterpreted bones turned out stranger. The skulls of <a href="http://img10.deviantart.net/049b/i/2011/093/a/8/elephant_skull_3_4_by_apteryxstock-d3d3uwp.jpg" target="_blank">mammoths and elephants</a> became associated with the giant cyclops, perhaps because of their similarity to the skulls of infants with the condition <a href="http://www.francecasts.com/images/products/giftshop/casts/large_optimized/Cyclopia%20anterior%20large.jpg" target="_blank">cyclopia. </a> The skeletons of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mi/dinosaurs/images/casts/protoceratops_gond.jpg" target="_blank">protoceratops</a>, which had beaks and feet like birds, but were four legged and with a long tail, were interpreted as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Knossos_fresco_in_throne_palace.JPG" target="_blank">griffins</a>, with a mix of features of eagles and lions to explain their unfamiliar bodies. Wings were optional!</p>
<p>More recently, early European interpretations of dinosaurs were a bit mixed up. They were seen through the lens of the modern great reptiles: sluggish, sprawling crocodiles and splay legged lizards which heated themselves in the sun. The iguanodon, as one of the earliest discovered, has some of the strangest reconstructions. Throwing in a plug for one of my favourite paleoartists, who has illustrated several 'evolutions' of dinosaur species over the years. Here's <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/The-iconically-wrong-Iguanodons-514487366" target="_blank">iguanodon</a>, check out their other stuff if you like it!</p>
<p>There's also been plenty of bones put together wrong intentionally, as a hoax or to make money. The most famous is probably the piltdown man, ever the favourite of creationists, a fake made from a human cranium and the fossil jaws of an orang utan. The funny part is that once real primitive human relatives were discovered, it turned out the piltdown man creator got things exactly backwards. He made a skull which showed an <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02416/piltdown-skull_2416562b.jpg" target="_blank">advanced cranium with a primitive face</a>, but the jaws shrunk and the <a href="http://www.prehistoricstore.com/newitems/m1387.jpg" target="_blank">face got flatter before the cranium grew</a> in reality. Another is <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6828/images/410539ba.2.jpg" target="_blank">Archaeoraptor</a>, a link between birds and dinosaurs which generated quite a bit of excitement until it was examined and found to be made of several fossils, including the tail of a microraptor and the body and wings of a primitive bird called yanornis, and other parts which have yet to be identified. The beautiful well preserved feathered theropod skeletons that come out of China are very valuable, so fakes are constructed from less valuable fossil fragments to this day, and often get passed around the black market (where the veracity of the fossils is under less scrutiny).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are mistakes, it is too simplistic to call it just trial and error. The primary way that dinosaurs are assembled is through the science of comparitive anatomy. For example, despite the radical difference between you and a whale, you actually share a great deal of analogous structures (bones of flippers vs bones of hand). This is evidence of evolution from a common ancestor. These bones are arranged in a similar fashion that gives clues on how to put it all together. By following the fossil record back through reptiles and avian reptiles (birds), you can determine the way ancient forms were assembled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
