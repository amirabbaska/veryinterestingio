		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The LHC accelerates protons or heavy nuclei to very high speeds, and then these objects undergo collisions. In those collisions, some of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) of those particles is converted into mass (which relativity shows is a form of energy), producing new particles.  Some of these will be newly made particles of types we already know, while there is also the chance to see a brand new kind of particle.  Studying what is produced gives us information about the particles that make up the universe and how they interact. </p>
<p>Electric fields are used to speed up the protons or heavy nuclei, while magnetic fields are used to guide them along the desired paths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an extremely complicated machine with many individual parts. At the lowest level, you can just say &quot;It's a particle accelerator.&quot; </p>
<p>The fundamental purpose of a particle accelerator is to produce a <em>beam</em> (or multiple beams) of particles. A beam is an ensemble of particles with a certain energy and intensity that you can use to shoot at a target or collide with another beam in order to cause reactions involving the beam particles.</p>
<p>Often you want the beam to be at a much higher energy that the typical kinetic energy of a gas molecule at room temperature, so you <em>accelerate</em> it.</p>
<p>For beams of charged particles, you accelerate them using electric fields. Depending on the type of accelerator, these will either be static electric fields or dynamic electric fields. (Static means that it doesn't change with time, and dynamic means that it does.)</p>
<p>Some examples of electrostatic accelerators would be Van de Graaf, Cockroft-Walton, and Wideroe linacs.</p>
<p>Some examples of electrodynamic accelerators would be cyclotrons, synchrotrons, and linacs with RF cavities.</p>
<p>The LHC has <a href="https://home.cern/about/accelerators" target="_blank">various stages of acceleration</a>. It's common to start with an electrostatic accelerator right after the ion source, and then use electrodynamic acceleration elements to do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;. If you plan to store the beam for a while, you may need to continually accelerate it in order to combat energy losses to electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>In addition to accelerating the beam, there are other elements along the beamline which control and monitor the beam. For example if you want to steer the beam so that it doesn't move in a straight line, you typically use a dipole magnet. In order to focus the beam so that it has a reasonable size, you use a series of quadrupole magnets. You can place something like a Faraday cup into the beamline in order to measure the electrical current of the beam, which can be converted into an intensity. Sometimes the way you produce your beam leads to contaminants, which you want to filter out in order to keep your beam pure.</p>
<p>All of these systems are combined to form one big machine which produces beams for experiments.</p>
<p>The kinds of experiments we can do using accelerators include producing new particles and reactions, testing theoretical models, producing already known particles in order to make or improve measurements of their properties, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The LHC has two beams of protons/heavy nuclei (lead atoms are common, depends on the experiment) that move in opposite directions. At 4 points around the 27 km ring the two beams cross each other. When this happens the cross sections of the beams are squeezed way way down so that there's an increased probability of them colliding. </p>
<p>At the collision points there is so much energy in such a small region (high energy density) that it recreates conditions similar to how things were in the early universe. In these high energy density conditions there is a much greater variety of particles that we can observe than what we see day to day. <em>Edit</em>: This is the goal of the LHC, to create the conditions of the early universe, as in fractions of a second after the big bang. The LHC is not simply trying to create new particles. Physicists there are investigating what happened after the big bang and how we see the lingering effects of that today. </p>
<p>How do they accelerate the particles up to speed? There are a series of electromagnetic cavities that set up what are basically EM standing waves. The charged particles then effectively &quot;surf&quot; along the front of the wave and are sped up. Much like a surfer couldn't possibly hope to pick up speed without a wave, the particles need a moving electric field to boost them. </p>
<p>To keep the particles on track there's a series of dipole and quadrupole magnets that guide the beam. The dipole magnets bend the beam to match the LHCs curvature. The quadrupole magnets squeeze the beam in one direction and pull it in the orthogonal direction. This is to keep the beam narrow since it spreads our naturally over time. Since the quadrupoles squish AND pull you chain them together in a series of alternating polarities to get just a squeeze effect. </p>
<p>The magnetic fields required to steer the particles are absolutely enormous. To achieve them we use incredibly powerful electromagnets. They draw so much current that we need to use superconducting materials which must be cooled down to close to 0 K. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions I work on an experiment at CERN (not on the LHC but you learn a lot about all of the other experiments) and I can try and answer your questions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm <em>really</em> late to this party, and if I don't get many hits, maybe I'll create a similar, new post, but, who <em>builds</em> things like the Large Hardron Collider?</p>
<p>Okay, a bunch of physicists know that they want to shoot particles at an energy of <em>x</em> electron volts, but they need some type of electrical engineer to design the machinery that does this. Err, I think. I mean, are there dual major Physicist/Electrical Engineers that do this? How does an electrical engineer, you know, get into designing high energy physics machinery?</p>
<p>And who are the companies that build this stuff? You know: integrators, i.e., companies with expertise that build things for industries all the time. Colliders aren't a large industry, so you can't just find a Kuka or Comau or a Wooshin that builds colliders all the time. This is some custom stuff.</p>
<p>To design, launch, and build a car takes <em>thousands</em> of engineers; everyone has his little piece. How the hell do you design, launch, and build a Large Hadron Collider???</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
