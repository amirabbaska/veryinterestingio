		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is also why &quot;fat people are sweaty&quot;. The total energy being consumed and so re-expressed as heat, is maybe double but the surface area they have at their disposal to dissipate is not twice as large so they have to sweat more to mitigate that extra heat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they are more resistant to cold since that surface area to volume thing reduces the rate at which they lose vital warmth when exposed to threatening cold.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of sliders in the biological mixer that trades the various body types benefits and drawbacks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR - Yes. </p>
<p>Source: I've recently lost 60 pounds. From 210 down to 150. I did it in about four months. </p>
<p>Three step process</p>
<ol>
<li>Cardio your guts out. Swim Bike Run 2-3 hours a day</li>
<li>Eat less than you burn. I averaged about 1100 cals a day in</li>
<li>Repeat every damn day</li>
</ol>
<p>In the beginning I could swim/bike/run for 45-60 each and I'd burn 1500 to 2000 a day easy. The first ten pounds flew off. The second ten came off easy. By the third ten pounds things slowed down. I was doing the same work. Maybe even harder (more resistance, incline, etc) and burning less. I had to talk to a trainer and discuss my situation to figure out that my body had someone acclimated and I needed to refocus. I went from long term cal burns to shorter burst of carb/cal burns with things like higher intensity reps with short intervals of rest between. I also adjusted my diet to actually eat a little more because I was eating to little. After that adjustment I was able to drop the second thirty pounds. Now if I do a swim/bike/run for 45-60 each (I'm preparing for Ironman!) I can burn about 1000-1200 ish with the same work that burned me 2000 before. </p>
<p>It was not fun but I finished last November and haven't looked back.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's right, it takes more calories just for a larger person to keep on living compared to a smaller one, simply because they have to fuel more cells.  This also means that lots of exercises (even walking) burn more calories for larger people, who are moving a larger load.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and that's one of the reasons why people who are dieting, etc. see more weight loss early on and then the rate of loss slows as they progress. They no longer burn as many calories just living as they did when carrying more weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely.  Hauling a 300 pound body up a flight of stairs takes around twice as much work (and calories) as a 150 pound body.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
