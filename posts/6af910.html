		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;public&quot; numbers are estimates, not firm numbers. In the case of public companies' founders, CEO's, etc. there are public disclosures of share ownership and that typically accounts for the vast majority of their net worth so it's used as proxy. There are also public disclosures like stock sales, there might be records of other investments they've made, etc. and the pieces are cobbled together to get an estimate.</p>
<p>For example, if billionaire X owns 50 million shares in the company he founded and it's trading at $100 then we know they are worth at least $5 billion. Maybe they've sold off 10 million shares over the years for living expenses and diversification clearing $600 million, and they've also bought 2 houses worth $20 million, a plane worth $50 million, invested $100 million in other companies and those holdings are now worth $400 million, etc. So they're worth an estimated $6 billion. Maybe it's off -- maybe they blew hundreds of millions gambling, or maybe they invested in Apple options and made a couple extra billion. So it's just an estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not public. In some cases, wealthy people will self-report their net worth because they are proud of it. In other cases a lot of their net worth comes from owning publicly traded stocks, and if you own enough stock in a publicly traded company then that is public information. Sometimes the wealth is also tied up in charitable foundations (like with Bill Gates) and those organizations' finances are public if they're non-profits. For wealthy people who own privately held companies, reporters interview people and get access to what information they can (property owned by them, companies owned by them, etc) to make an educated guess.</p>
<p>You can read more about how Forbes assembles its annual list here (scroll down to &quot;Methodology&quot;): <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2013/09/16/inside-the-2013-forbes-400-facts-and-figures-on-americas-richest/#26fd563123d8" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2013/09/16/inside-the-2013-forbes-400-facts-and-figures-on-americas-richest/#26fd563123d8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't always easy. As many have pointed out, many wealthy individuals own shares of publicly traded stock. The value of that is pretty easy b/c if they own &gt; 10% they must disclose it.</p>
<p>However, that leaves out private holdings such as partnerships or stock that is not publicly traded. In such cases, not only do we not know a person's percentage of ownership but we have to estimate the value of the holding.</p>
<p>It also leaves out any debt. Generally speaking that isn't required to be disclosed since it's a personal relationship with the creditor.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is a good example of someone whose wealth has always been hard to estimate with any real confidence because he has always had plenty of both private holdings and debt. He probably doesn't know his own net worth with any precision to speak of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Home purchases and sales are a matter of public record. So you know when Mr. X buys and sells real estate. Professional sports players salaries are public. A CEO has stock, it is disclosed in SEC filings and has to be disclosed when it is sold too. The salary is also public for a publicly traded company too. So it is relatively simple to calculate for many high net worth individuals because the information is public. The information is public because there is a public interest to prevent insider trading in the stock market. </p>
<p>If you work for the state many will also have publicly available records for teacher salaries listed by employee name. So if you know where to look, you can actually find out the information for average joe as well. If you know what job a person has at a certain employer, and you look at job sites that list average salaries for the position you can generally figure out what an average person makes too. If they own their home, you can figure out what they paid for it too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the ultra-rich invest their money into stocks, and are often major stock holders for the companies in which they own stock, or often, it's their own companies that they hold stock in.  Stock ownership in companies for major stockholders (usually any more than 5% or 10% of the company's value) are of public record.</p>
<p>It's pretty simple to add up the major stock holdings of these ultra-rich and estimate their net worth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
