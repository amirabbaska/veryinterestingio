		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine instead of a stopwatch you have a guy whose job it is to count the seconds as they go by. (1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, etc.) If the guy is well fed and got a good night's sleep, he will count at an even, steady, pace and when he says 60 Mississippi you can be pretty sure a minute has gone by.</p>
<p>Now let's say the guy skipped breakfast and is really tired. He might lose track, or count slower, and will therefore be less accurate.</p>
<p>In a lot of electronics, the &quot;guy&quot; is crystal (like the quartz in a quartz watch), and with the proper voltage the crystal will vibrate at a steady and predictable pace. As the voltage drops as the batteries die the quartz vibrates at a slower speed, so the internal clock of whatever device is controlling the sound is slower. The pitch lowers as a result. </p>
<p>The sound doesn't stop completely because the internal clock still has some juice, just not enough to run at full speed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Why do toys that are low on battery slow down and change pitch instead of stopping completely <strong>like many modern electronic devices, such as mobile phones, do</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As others have said, low batteries cause electronics to slow down.</p>
<p>But many more complex devices have chips which simply won't work if they don't run at a consistent speed with the right voltage. So because of this, they constantly monitor their batteries, and shut themselves down (claiming to have 0% battery left) when the battery is low enough that the voltage starts to drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As the water feed tank empties (akin to low batteries), pressure drops, and the device performs sluggishly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing that most people seem to miss is that (cheap) oscillators are dependent on voltage. To play sound the electronics need a reference frequency, to know how fast should they be playing back the recorded sound. If the oscillator giving this reference shifts in frequency because the voltage changes all sounds will change in pitch.
The slow movement part is correctly explained by the other comments. Less voltage in the batteries means less power for the motors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toys use simple circuitry as fidelity is usually not needed, these simple circuits use timers/oscillators that vary depending on the voltage supplied, tones are created by oscillating a voltage at high frequency.</p>
<p>A battery will drop in voltage over time as it loses its charge, affecting the frequency of the tone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
