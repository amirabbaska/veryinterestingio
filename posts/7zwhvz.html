		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays not a lot.</p>
<p>Modern electronic equipment has a negligible standby power consumption but it's not zero so there will be a micro saving. But boiling too much water in an electric kettle or letting warmed air leak from a leaky building will cause far higher power wastage than leaving your TV or PVR plugged in and on standby. </p>
<p>Switching off when not in use is a good policy so don't switch on the games console, satellite receiver, PVR, and the Bluray/DVD at the same time.</p>
<p>Unplugging has no environmental effect on its own in so far as you can switch off the mains power at the socket in some cases, or use remote switchable adaptors to disconnect power supplies when not in use.</p>
<p>Edit: a word</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in how much electricity your devices use when not in use, I'd recommend a Kill-A-Watt device. It'll give you realtime information on watt consumption. The term for this is standby power, or I've always heard it called ghost load: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power</a></p>
<p>In short, it depends on the device. Some are better than others. In aggregate, all our devices do have some meaningful effect on the minimum amount of electricity the grid needs to produce as a baseline. Peak electricity usage - for instance at times when air conditioning use is high - may be a more significant factor in terms of environmental impact. If you're looking to make a personal contribution, consider looking into weatherproofing (insulation, weatherstripping, finding leaky windows or doors) your home to save energy on heating and cooling, or planting a tree outside your home where it will provide summer shade. These energy sources are typically much higher than your average consumer electrronic in standby. </p>
<p>I'm a firm believer that every little bit helps.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rambling message with probably lots of typos (on my phone).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Average annual usage of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/231886/tested-should-you-unplug-chargers-when-youre-not-using-them/" target="_blank">6 plugged in chargers</a> not in use for 16 hours a day: 1.752kWh.</p>
<p>Percentage of average American household power usage by 6 plugged in chargers not in use for 16 hours a day every single day of the year: 0.0163%.</p>
<p>Total cost of these 6 plugged in chargers not in use for 16 hours: $0.21</p>
<p>If $0.21 per year matters to you, then you go ahead and spend (5 seconds to unplug/re-plug per day)(365 days per year) = (30 minutes) every year.</p>
<p>As for environment, CO<em><em>2</em></em> saved each year: 1.09kg.</p>
<p>Current CO<em><em>2</em></em> per US person per year: 16,400kg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most modern devices have a very low standby power consumption. However, some devices appear to be in standby when they are actually in another state that is consuming more power. Some devices consume quite a lot of power when in stand-by. It is also easier to just unplug your whole TV and related devices compared to making sure they are all off.</p>
<p>Some special cases I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>My desk consumes 4 watts in power all the time. It has a powered raise/lower mechanism that consumes 4W 24/7 when not unplugged.</li>
<li>I had a set of speakers that had an auto-standby. It consumed 9W 24/7 when not shut-down with a hardware switch.</li>
<li>My TV consumes 11W when in &quot;standby&quot;. At least, I thought it was in standby. If I shut-down my home theatre receiver, my TV also goes black. At least, that's what I thought: In reality, it appears the screen is just 100% black without backlight. The TV's electronics are still powered I think, hence the 11W load.</li>
<li>Same for my computer monitor. I have a computer monitor that features a &quot;fast turn-on&quot; that immediately turns on as soon as you touch your computer. Turns out the power consumption remains about 6W in that mode, while it is &lt;1W in real standby.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, stuff that is not plugged in can also not catch fire when they are faulty, even though that is a very low chance of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since 2013 most consumer devices sold in the EU must have a low power standby mode, and must use less than 0.5W while in this mode. </p>
<p>The European Commission website has some numbers and links for further reading: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-products/standby" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-products/standby</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These rules have reduced annual electricity consumption by around 35.5 TWh per year – the equivalent to the annual energy consumption of Romania. This has saved consumers €25 billion per year and 39 Mt of CO2 emissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the difference between unplugging and leaving devices plugged in is very small, at least for any devices that are also sold in the EU.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
