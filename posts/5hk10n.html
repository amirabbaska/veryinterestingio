		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Often when lightning strikes a person, the person is wet. If the layer of water is less resistive than your internal organs, most of the current will flow through the layer of water. It'll heat up and burn you, but it doesn't necessarily kill you. </p>
<p>Also, often times lightning strikes in the vicinity of a person, but not the person directly. This usually means they'll get current flowing through their legs, but not across their heart, which usually isn't fatal. Again, serious burns will occur.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Longer explanation</strong></p>
<p>Something &quot;containing&quot; a certain amount of volts really doesn't convey well how it all works.</p>
<p>The voltage (or potential) is a measure for the difference in electric charge between two things. So when we say, there's 3.7V <strong>across</strong> a battery, that's a measure of how many electrons there's more on one terminal vs the other.</p>
<p>The bigger the voltage, the harder the electrons try to go from one place to the other (which is why the water pressure analogy often is used). Dry air can  insulate about 3000V (3kV) per mm (about 76.2 kV per inch). So if you put two conductors 1 cm apart and put over 30kV across them, the air will start conducting. When this happens, the electricity will ionize the air, creating plasma. This is the spark you see. </p>
<p>Lightning is just a bigger version of that process, where the air in the clouds is electrically charged. This electricity tries to jump to anything with a lower charge. If the voltage across the air/ground gap is big enough, the electricity can flow across he gap.</p>
<p>Now, what you need to understand is that electricity only kills if you get enough of it flowing at once through the wrong parts. The amount of electricity flowing <strong>through</strong> something is the current or amperage.  </p>
<p>People always say that it's not the volts, but the amps that kill you. In reality, there's more to it. You need enough voltage to get enough current flowing to hurt you. Your body has a certain resistance to electricity flow. (current = voltage / resistance). </p>
<p>What's also important is the path the electricity takes. A big-ass current flowing from the tip of you finger to the palm of your hand will give you a nasty burn, but it won't stop your heart from beating. A small zap flowing from one arm to the other might do that more effectively.</p>
<p>The last thing you need to know is that electricity will follow the path of least resistance. If there's multiple paths available, the current flowing through each will be inversely proportional to each path's respective resistance.</p>
<p>Thus, if lightning strikes you when you have a layer of water all over your body (it's raining, most likely), that water might be conducting enough to keep most of the electricity from even entering your body. It just flows through the layer of water on your skin.</p>
<p>A lightning strike will heat that water up a lot, though. So you'll probably have some serious burns. But if there isn't an appreciable amount of electricity flowing through your heart, chances are you'll live to tell the story. </p>

<p>EDIT: corrected breakdown voltage for air, thanks /u/yanroy. Also, RIP inbox</p>
<p>EDIT2: <del>it's both</del> there's more to it. I realize this is dumbed down. This is still ELI5, not askscience</p>
<p>EDIT3: forgot correcting one of the voltages -_- thanks, /u/Timst44</p>
<p>EDIT4: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an electrical engineer and here's my take on lightning. It's a common misconception that people survive being struck by lightning.   When people are <em>&quot;struck by lightning&quot;</em> and survive, they're always struck by what is called a streamer.  Streamers are small off shoots of the main arc or bolt of lightning.  The streamers contain much less energy than the main arc.  </p>
<p>Voltage is not really relevant when it comes to injury.  What kills is the current or actually the combination of current and voltage or the energy of the arc.  </p>
<p>Think of the static spark you get when putting on a coat or touching a door knob.  This spark is often 10,000's of volts.  However, if you touched a power line with 10,000 or more volts you would not likely survive in one piece.  The difference is that the spark on the door knob has a very tiny current whereas the power line has a huge current potential.  It's really the dissipated watts in the body that kills.  Let me give you a personal example.  </p>
<p>Years ago, I was working with a 500,000 volt (400 watt) Tesla coil and suddenly it arced to my finger tip.  The discharge nearly killed me.  I had psychological problems for a month following the shock and still have some nerve damage to this day.</p>
<p>Had the dissipated power been higher than 400 watts I would have likely died, had it been much lower I would not been injured.  </p>
<p>I have witnessed lightning strikes which have exploded trees and in one case blew up a brick patio with such force it threw bricks so high in the air they fell back and through the roof of the house and were found over 100 yards away from the strike.  This happens because the energy in a main lightning arc is staggering.  It will literally super heat the water in a tree or root as was the case with the patio, until the water turns to steam and a steam explosion occurs.  </p>
<p>Now imagine the human body taking the full energy of a lightning strike, the chances of survival are nearly zero.  Yet the side streamers containing less energy (much like the Tesla coil) can hit a person such that they survive.  </p>
<p>A direct lightning strike on a human body will typically burn it to the appearance of charcoal, if it doesn't explode. </p>
<p>In this picture you can see a main lightning arc with many streamers.  You can survive a streamer but not the main strike.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring complex things about how electricity works, as far as the killing power of electricity; it can be described easily with an analogy of falling objects. Imagine instead of getting zapped by electricity, you're having an item dropped on your head. Voltage would be the height it was dropped, and current would be the weight of the item dropped (non eli5 explanation: the voltage is potential energy and current is kinetic energy and potential energy such as height is transferred to kinetic energy through falling in a ratio relating to it's mass and gravity). So if you have high voltage, and really low current, it's like having something dropped on your head from the empire state building but that something is a feather. If you have low voltage high current it's like having a brick dropped on your head from the top of a house. In most cases like people have mentioned, electricity takes the path of least resistance, so when you're struck by lightning, a large portion of the current from that strike goes to the ground (less resistance) and a very small portion goes to you (more resistance). So it's a high voltage, low current scenario in this case. In addition, the way your body is laid out, most of the current would be directed away from vital organs in most cases and travels around them. I can explain why the current splits between you and the ground as well as why it goes around your organs in more eli5 detail if desired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father is an electrical engineer and this is what he told me when I younger about electrocution. </p>
<p>The two ways electricity kills is by stopping your heart or by cooking you.  Lightning doesn't last long enough to cook you very much.  </p>
<p>Much like being shot, it depends where you get &quot;hit.&quot;  If electricity travels through your heart, you will probably die.  But if most of it goes around, like from your arm, down your side, down your leg, you may live.  The biggest factors are if your heart restarts on its own, or if you are given attention quickly enough to restart your heart.</p>
<p>Even if you live, there will be a lot of damage from a lightning strike.  If you search lichtenberg figure scar on google, you will see lots of scars from people being hit.  It can also cause lasting neurological damage.  In addition, you will be slightly &quot;cooked&quot; which is a lot like a skin burn... except it'll be parts of your internal organs and muscles. </p>
<p>Secondly, voltage is just one measurement of electricity and not very important in terms of killing power.  Amperage is much more important in terms of what will kill you. </p>
<p>Think of it like a car.  A car can be measured by speed or by weight.  A car moving .1 mph probably won't harm you when it bumps into you, no matter how much it weighs.  But a car moving 60mph will probably kill you regardless if it is a heavy truck or a light sedan. Like voltage, the weight doesn't matter very much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lightning will take the path of least resistance through the human body.  If that happens to be through or over the skin, missing important organs (especially the heart) then it's survivable, although you will likely come out with some burns and of course enough burns can kill you by themselves.  </p>
<p>Electricity is always most lethal to the heart, as it keeps its timing using electrical impulses</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
