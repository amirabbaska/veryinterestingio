		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming by &quot;asleep&quot; you mean the prickly / tingly feeling, that's actually your nerve being cut off and your brain partially losing connection to the nerve endings in that limb. Next time it happens, poke the limb with your hand. You'll notice the sense of touch in the sleeping limb is muted or sometimes even gone entirely. </p>
<p>Long term, this isn't very likely to cause any harm - if you've ever woken up in an odd position and lose all feeling and control over one arm or something, it's the same thing, pinching off a nerve, but you held that position possibly for hours because you were asleep.</p>
<p>Now as for actually pinching off the flow of blood, that can definitely do damage. I think some cells in your body don't need oxygen, but most of them do, including muscles and skin, which are literally everywhere in or on your body. So if you pinch the blood off of a limb, all the cells that need oxygen would starve and eventually die. I don't know exactly how long it would take but considering it only takes a few minutes of oxygen deprivation for permanent brain damage to be likely, it would probably be measured in minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out &quot;Saturday Night Palsy&quot;. This can happen if you fall asleep with your arm over a chair and don't move it through the night.</p>
<p>So the nerve running down your arm is squeezed for a long time. Imagine a frayed telephone cord- the message isn't traveling from your brain to your hand (muscle control) or from your hand to your brain (sensory) This can cause loss of feeling, loss of movement, or hand deformities from muscle wasting as the nerve can't feel messages from your hand and can't communicate messages to the muscles in your hand.</p>
<p>There's a sheath around nerves and then the nerve itself, depending on how damaged the sheath is or if damage is done to the nerve itself you can have different degrees of damage. Recovery time depends on the level of damage. Recovery of 6-8 weeks: neuropraxia. Recovery of several months:Â axonotmesis. Nope: neurotmesis. </p>
<p>Edit: I think the lack of blood flow causes damage from cell death</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard to ELI5 this, but here we go:</p>
<p>Many things happen when your nerves are starved for oxygen and none of them are good and it gets worse the more starved they are.  This happens when their blood flow is interrupted.</p>
<p>'falling asleep' is the lowest thing on this list and is the most neutral for your nerves - its not painful and goes away in seconds to minutes.  The nerves recover quickly and go about their business. Basically the signal they send goes all wonky when they are initially starved and then get oxygen again when pressure is released (sensory - signal going up to brain).   They are also hard to move (motor - signal going down to limb).</p>
<p>more severely, we have <a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/neuropathy" target="_blank">neuropathy</a> which has symptoms similar to 'falling asleep' but can become permanent and hurt more than 'falling asleep'.</p>
<p>If starvation is nearly complete and goes for a long time, the nerves can die (actually the starved, and therefore damaged, axons of the neurons degenerate - the neuron cell bodies themselves survive in all but the worst cases) which can take months to repair in a good case or never in a really bad case.  This entire process is an active area of research.</p>
<p>to answer the second part: hours to days depending on how complete the constriction is</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's not from a loss of bloodflow. a limb falling asleep is caused by nerve signals being lost to the affected area. on its own, it's harmless. atrophy would occur if it persisted for a truly absurd length of time. </p>
<p>far more likely is that the cause of the limb falling asleep has other effects that are far more dangerous. constant pressure to a small area, a joint held in a stressful position, etc. these things can cause damage on their own if they persist for extended periods, regardless of your limb being asleep or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how long the nerve is compressed. For example, Saturday night palsy is from falling asleep with your nerve compressed. Effects can last for weeks to months if you're unlucky.</p>
