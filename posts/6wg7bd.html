		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power Transmission Engineer here.</p>
<p>The power is mostly likely off in 99% of these areas. If the utilities are doing their jobs correctly, then relays, lockouts, circuit switchers, and the like would have operated, isolating these customer's from power.</p>
<p>Those that are still getting lights are probably on back up generators.</p>
<p>Now, lets talk about the dangers of having power in a flooded house. These people are taking their lives into their own hands here. <strong>ANY</strong> electrical that's been exposed to water, especially breaker boxes is considered damaged beyond repair and <em>MUST</em> be replaced. Why? Corrosion. All these contacts, especially with active voltage and current in the lines, are corroding as we speak.</p>
<p><em>ALL</em> wiring and components will have to be replaced, it is part of the restoration process to get your power restored to the house.</p>
<p>Next, we'll talk about what's happening to the grid in these areas. Power comes to your house via a substation, any of these substations that went underwater, whether these cables were buried or not, will have to most likely be ripped out and be replaced.</p>
<p>If any of the power that is coming from the utilities is still on, then their protection schemes have failed and there is something poorly planned in their relay performance/design area. By rights, if they are competent engineers then the following should have happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Water floods the switch yard, and shorts out lets say a breaker. The breaker should be wired to do its job, break the current and lockout. Meaning it cannot be re-engaged unless an operator is on sight. With the loss of power to the breaker, the relay protecting this part of equipment would see a &quot;Loss of Potential&quot; at the breaker, thus tripping a lockout again, creating another point where an operator would have to reset it.</p>
<p>With water now in the switch yard, the sub house will most likely be next to go out. Station service is provided by special potential transformers, called SSVT (station service voltage transformers) these devices take bus voltage from the PT's and sends it to be converted into DC and powers a battery set. These will be protected by their own protection scheme. Seeing that the voltage on a circuit breaker is gone, the bus voltage will drop out, thus dropping the station service. (All lockouts should have operated because of this, again isolating the sub and customers affected)</p>
<p>Now, depending on how this substation operates, it could either be radially fed, power coming from one direction, or networked, power coming from many directions. If the station is radially fed, then anything connected downstream from this sub will be out of power and nothing will restore it until whatever is in the circuit is repaired. If the service is networked, then once this sub goes out, power is restored nearly instantaneously by rerouting through other circuits connected to it, transferring load. (This is why your lights might blink during a storm.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, everything I've talked about either happens in a few cycles to upwards of 3600 cycles.</p>
<p>A cycle is: 60cy/sec, which translates to 1/60th of a second to one minute. It all depends on what the engineers have set this stuff to operate at.</p>
<p>TL;DR: These people still using power have either backup generators or their utilities have failed them. Any flooded house should not have power and are opening themselves up to death. If the utilities are providing power and someone dies of an electric shock then they are opening themselves up to lawsuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seawater-level salinity has very low electrical resistance  - approximately 0.2 ohms per meter. &quot;Drinking water&quot; i.e. mineralized freshwater like lake, stream or spring water ranges between 20 and 2000 ohms per meter. Rainwater in hurricane flooding, although 'dirty' from the ground, may be on the less conductive end of that; not enough to trip breakers. The voltage potential in the water will vary based on the distance from hot points and paths to ground. You may have working power, but you still shouldn't move about through a house with standing water and live power, because you can't know for sure where you are safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My house flooded two years ago, and it freaked me out initially when the power stayed on. I was told by the power company the next morning that since our lines are buried and insulated, they would continue to function. I asked about getting shocked, and they seemed to think there was little danger.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4 years studying electrical engineering and 5 more years designing and troubleshooting 120-600V industrial heaters installed in wet conditions served only to teach me that I don't understand electricity. It's always 10% MAGIC. Especially ground faults. Insulation breaks down, GFIs fail, things are wired poorly. The easiest path isn't always obvious. Just because everyone came out ok doesn't mean they will next time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as everything is insulated and nothing has actually broken any power lines (which may well be underground), there's no reason for electricity not to work. It doesn't just magically stop working when there's a flood. </p>
<p>Now why these people didn't go to the main circuit breaker and shut it off just in case is another question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
