		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are five separate problems.  These problems require storage that lasts a hundredth of a second and just smooths out voltage, to minutes or hours of storage, to days or months or years.  In order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dirty power: power sources need to react to the grid down to fractions of a second.  When the voltage is high/low or isn't a clean 60/50 Hz signal, you call it dirty power.  In conventional grids, the frequency and voltage of the grid is tied to how fast the generators are spinning- &quot;rotor inertia&quot;.  The fluctuations in the grid are literally smoothed out by having to speed up or slow down massive spinning steel armatures.  Obviously this means that solar PV can have a problem with this- if you have too much solar on at once and it isn't carefully regulated, the grid can become unstable if there isn't enough inertia.  Wind has this problem too but to a much lesser degree, and sometimes its even better than normal since you also have the inertia of the turbines.  The solutions to this problem are complex but mostly don't involve storage and aren't really a fundamental problem with renewables.  People like to throw around plots of German electricity being unstable but it's not really a big deal and afaik it's mostly related to poor controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load following: This is a real problem- sudden minute-by-minute spikes in load can destabilize some renewables.  Natural gas plants are used for this purpose in normal grids- you add more fuel to the turbine and it spools up the power.  With renewables you're usually operating near 100% of what you can currently output so you can't add more.  In principle renewables are extremely good at this as well, but currently they undercut peaker plants and reduce the number of plants responding to spikes.  Even so- this problem actually gets better the more renewables you add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peak demand: Electric power <a href="http://www.mpoweruk.com/images/elec_load_demand.gif" target="_blank">varies</a> over the day.  Compare that to <a href="http://www.sma.de/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_Load-profile-and-consumption_EN_1d158c119d.jpg" target="_blank">solar power</a> over the day.  Power demand drops by 50% at night, but solar supply drops to 0%.  That's a huge problem- one of baseload.  You need storage of some kind to deal with this, even with wind.  We will absolutely need some kind of daily storage with renewable energy (aside from biomass or geothermal, which are not practical at scale).  There are two ways to deal with this.  At ~20%, you run into short-term problems- the supply will be less than the demand at some points, like the afternoon or very early morning.  You can deal with this using batteries, or you can simply build more solar panels.  Economically it is initially cheaper to build more panels but as solar starts to supply 60%+ of power, you need batteries for the remaining 30%+ because there simply is no sun.  This is the real point that we will unarguably need batteries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weather constraints: Sometimes it snows, or there is no wind or too much wind.  You need emergency storage.  This is a non-issue until 30%+ renewable energy, because the capacity we have greatly exceeds how much we use.  If all renewables just stop working, we'd have to put every other plant on full power, but we still wouldn't need storage.  It depends on the grid when this happens, but places with &quot;peakier&quot; daily needs will have more capacity and will be able to take more renewables.  Probably this will happen somewhere between 30-50% renewable penetration, at which point you'll need <em>some</em> storage.  The most common estimate is 3 days of stored renewables, but you won't need that right away.  3 days of storage is a lot more than it sounds like- grid-scale systems with dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU-hSFFwSmo" target="_blank">MPPT</a> controllers can still pull 50% power out of very poor weather, so 3 days of storage means you can last out week long constant storms before brown-outs.</p>
</li>
<li>Seasonal demand: Finally, there are <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_pv_us_december_dec2008.jpg" target="_blank">winter</a>/<a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_pv_us_january_dec2008.jpg" target="_blank">summer</a> demand and supply changes (maps from <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  This is totally impractical to solve with storage except underground gas storage.  In some cases (worst in the NW US, but still not good in the NE US), the combination of increased demand and decreased sunlight means you need <em>triple</em> the solar panels to supply enough power for winter.  NB: snow is less of a problem than you'd think.  At higher latitudes panels need to be tilted more so they face the sun- by the time you're far enough north to get snow, the panels are steep enough that snow slides off them naturally!</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, the crossover is 30-50% renewables depending on many factors.  Until then renewables are mostly different rather than disadvantaged.  &quot;Economically impossible&quot; is a vague term- currently 3 days of battery storage costs ~2x as much as the solar it would be storing.  That would imply that a 100% grid would cost 200% more than the current grid per kWh- is that economically impossible?  That increase would affect our quality of life relatively little, but still few people would <em>want</em> that.  At the same time the cost of a 100% solar grid with 3 days of storage would be a ~20 trillion dollar investment in the US.  That's the total annual GDP, or 5 years of the complete federal budget- a 100% renewable grid is a certain economic impossibility for decades because of the sheer cost of replacing what we have now.  I will also point out that even now grid scale storage is relatively affordable- averaged over half a century.  Better technology and price decreases ($400/kWh -&gt; $150/kWh) will make batteries very affordable.  That will happen over the next decade or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the local climate.</p>
<p>Here's a model looking at a scenario for all demand met by PV &amp; wind, using spare power to generate fuel which is burnt when there'd otherwise by a deficit: for <a href="http://energynumbers.info/balancing/?cy=gb&amp;example=1" target="_blank">Britain</a>, for <a href="http://energynumbers.info/balancing/?cy=de&amp;example=1" target="_blank">Germany</a>, for <a href="http://energynumbers.info/balancing/?cy=es&amp;example=1" target="_blank">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>For somewhere like Spain, we get about 85% of demand met in real time by wind + PV, with a chunk of over-production for export and/or storage. A similar proportion of real-time demand met in Britain &amp; German, requires a higher proportion of over-production.</p>
<p>Also, wind and solar aren't the only technologies available - there's hydro, biomass, and in some places geothermal too.</p>
<p>And we don't yet know how economical the advanced storage technologies (in the above example, power-to-gas) are, because we haven't scaled them up yet. It's early days - we haven't needed much storage, so there's been very little investment in grid-scale storage research &amp; development. That's starting to change now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're correct in the fact that it can't be done without better energy storage, but it definitely is possible. A recent storage technology uses large rotating masses to store energy instead of chemical batteries. It's promising because you should never have to maintain or replace it. The only issue is it's still a young expensive technology. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
