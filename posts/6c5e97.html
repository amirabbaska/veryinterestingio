<p>I'm usually skeptical of such dramatic claims, but I've only found one contradictory source online, and it's a little dramatic itself: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709556" target="_blank">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709556</a></p>
<p>So my question is: how were ISP's able to receive so much money with zero accountability? Did the government really set up a handshake agreement over $200 billion?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you should go to the source:  I've written 3 books about this starting in 1998 -- and all of these appear to be related to the same threads -- over 2 decades. </p>
<p>Here's a free copy of the latest book, &quot;The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal &amp; Free the Net&quot;, which we put up a few weeks ago because few, if anyone actually bothered to read how the calculations were done. They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick
<a href="http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/" target="_blank">http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/</a></p>
<p>I've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history &quot;The Unauthorized Bio&quot; with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot; in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't.
I updated the book in 2015 &quot;The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;, but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting. </p>
<p>We paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion. </p>
<p>Finally, I note. These are not &quot;ISPs&quot;; they are state utility telecommunications companies that were able to take over the other businesses (like ISPs) thanks to the FCC under Mike Powell, now the head of the cable association. They got away with it because they could create a fake history that reporters and politicians kept repeating. No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&amp;T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&amp;T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location). </p>
<p>It's time to take them to court. period. We should go after the financial manipulations (cross-subsidies) where instead of doing the upgrades to fiber, they took the money and spent it everywhere else, like buying AOL or Time Warner (or overseas investments), etc. We should hold them accountable before this new FCC erases all of the laws and obligations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the agreement had no teeth, probably because it didn't define the problem in actual terms that could be acted upon in the case of failure.</p>
<p>Really, how would you want the contract written to require broadband for everyone? You can't require 100% coverage because my grandmother doesn't want it. You can't​ require everyone that wants it gets it because there is that guy in Alaska that lives 500 miles from his closest neighbor. You can try to say 80% of people who ask can get it, but what happens for those that can't get it? They can't get it because they are not in XYZ's coverage area. But they are asking because they are in nobody's coverage area, so what company puts them down as a no when none applies, who do you blame for not expanding? That metric doesn't work either.</p>
<p>The problem is the only concrete stuff you can do is tell them where to spend it, if that's on ”installing fiber&quot; then that's what they'll spend it on. But ISPs are constantly installing fiber, in fact that may be spending billions a year just to replace existing fiber, if you tell them you'll pay for it they'll just stop paying for installing fiber and let you pay, the money saved can be given out to shareholders. That of course is equivalent to just giving the money away, but there wasn't anything that said they can't​ do that.</p>
<p>So really it's a very hard problem to define, there can be some requirements on it, but they can't be tough, and that makes it just about equal to giving it away. If the government wanted their money spent on expanding access to specific markets they would of been required to tell the ISPs exactly what they want built and then maintained ownership of it, the way the power company where I live works. But that's government run ISPs, and everyone seems to hate that idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also helps to start in the 1980s with the history of how we got our current ISPs.</p>
<p>The TLDR version is:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation#Monopoly" target="_blank">AT&amp;T had a monopoly</a>.  They built a lot of their infrastructure via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain" target="_blank">eminent domain</a> law and taxpayer money, for the &quot;greater good.&quot;  As a business, using other people's money to grow is a good move.  The issue currently is ISPs don't want the government telling them what to do with the infrastructure.</p>
<p>See, in the 1980s all these other people wanted to get into the same business AT&amp;T had, but they didn't want to invest in building infrastructure when AT&amp;T already did, using eminent domain and tax money.  These other businesses argued that AT&amp;T having sole control over the lines was unfair, since taxes paid for some of it.  The government stepped in and said, &quot;sorry, Ma Bell, but you have to share.&quot;  Because of this we got a lot of ISPs that sprang up in a short amount of time, and until a few years ago all those ISPs were fighting for their own chunks of business.</p>
<p>Now we're stuck with a few large ISPs that control everything, just enough to the point of legally being able to say it's not a &quot;monopoly&quot; when for the most part people have no choice in their city for an ISP.</p>
<p>America has been sick of having no choice, and poor internet speeds, so the government has once again tried to encourage growth by using tax money as an incentive to expand.  </p>
<p>The problem is the ISPs are deathly afraid of expanding while the Net Neutrality laws exist because they don't want other small ISP startups coming along and using the infrastructure they're making.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is, the big ISPs don't want to expand with better fiber service anywhere unless they can control it, but they also won't pass up free tax money.  They take any free tax money they get from the government and then exploit loopholes from shoddy contracts to avoid actually expanding.  They invent excuses to avoid actually expanding.</p>
<p>Basically the ISPs have been holding internet infrastructure expansion hostage until the FCC rebrands them, because they don't want to be held accountable to governmental oversight.  They want to monopolize the new fiber system before they actually build it, and recently the FCC caved in to their demands.  </p>
<p>I'm not just regurgitating stuff I've read on the internet here.  I used to work for MCI, a company that wouldn't have existed if the FCC didn't break up Ma Bell in the 80s.</p>
<p>(<em>edit:</em> clarity)</p>
<p>(<em>edit:</em> Thanks for the Gold!  It's my very first one!  I'm deeply Humbled!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These figures seem to all be laid out by Bruce Kushnick, chairman of Teletruth and Director of the New Networks Institute, who also wrote the &quot;The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;. In his previous 2006 book named &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot;, which can be found at <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF.pdf</a> as it seems to have been given in its entirety as a public comment, and as the ycombinator commenters point out, the author seems to arrive at the ~$200 billion figure based mainly on overcharging that the author figures should have been better regulated by the government.</p>
<p>I think where the confusion stems is from the line in blog for the new book which says: &quot;<em>America will have been charged about $400 billion</em>&quot;, which may have gotten confused as being entirely some form of subsidy or handout from the government while the author probably means the overcharging of each individual American customer plus the tax write-offs as per his 2006 book. Without seeing the book we can't be certain but given the author's very similar claims from his 2006 I would say it's a safe assumption.</p>
<p>As for why all this overcharging happened: it was not just the ISPs which were doing it. Computer technology in the home and office seriously exploded from around the 1980s and on at a pace that made it ripe for exploit as it was all so very new without nearly as many expectations and understanding as we have today. Part of that exploitation was monopolies that probably shouldn't have happened, including Microsoft which lost an important anti-trust case in 1998. The main argument seems to be that Internet, which is even replacing phone service in some parts and will do so even more then true 4G is fully rolled out, should be a well-regulated utility like phone service currently is in the US. Based on this notion we have the idea of the US government &quot;letting&quot; the companies have all this money from the American people.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does anybody pocket anything? You give me $200 billion to do something.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Well that something requires a plan. So I pay myself $500 million to explore and investigate that plan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I finish the investigation of that plan to do something, I pay myself another $500 million to work out the logistics of implementing the plan and creating the jobs necessary to complete the plan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We start doing that something, but only a little, and way over budget. I pay myself the leftover $1 billion doing very little of that something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're way past deadline, way over budget, and I've moved all the money from the fund to my own pocket. So I stop doing that something and wait for you to give me more free money.  </p>
</li>
<li>You're not getting your money back suckers. <em>What u gonna do about it? Cash me outside. How ba da?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The mistake was our politicians giving corporations large sums of money to do something without effective enforcement mechanisms. The politicians were either corrupt or egregiously naive to think a corporation would act in society's interest rather than shareholder's interest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
