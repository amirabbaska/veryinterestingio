		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars almost certainly had an ocean worth of water early in the life of the Solar System. However, the planet's low mass means it also has a relatively low escape velocity, and all sorts of escape processes can cause atmosphere to leak out to space. </p>
<p>Water vapor on its own is just a bit too heavy to easily escape Mars (heavier molecules have slower speeds, and thus a harder time reaching escaping velocity). However, Mars has no form of ultraviolet shielding the way that Earth has an ozone layer. Gaseous water vapor that evaporated from the oceans could push high into the atmosphere and be exposed to ultraviolet photons. These are energetic enough to split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is a very light atom, and can very readily escape Mars out to space. On an early Mars, this would primarily occur through two processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just being warm enough, the fastest moving hydrogen atoms can reach escape velocity.</p>
</li>
<li>Early in the Solar System's there were a lot more impacts from asteroids, and Mars happens to be located very close to the asteroid belt. From our estimates of impact frequency at that time and location, there were more than enough to blow off most of the Martian atmosphere in just the first 100 million years.</li>
</ul>
<p>(A lot of folks might mention the fact that Mars currently doesn't have a magnetic field and thus exposes it to the full force of the solar wind. While that's an important process now, it's likely Mars did have a magnetic field early in its history.)</p>
<p>So that's what happened to the hydrogen that was in all that water...but what about the oxygen? Well, an oxygen atom is 16 times heavier than a hydrogen atom, so it's considerably more difficult for it to reach escape velocity. </p>
<p>However, free oxygen is also very reactive, so most of it likely reacted with surface minerals before it had a chance to escape. After all, the Martian surface was originally black like lava rock; only by getting massively oxidized did it turn red.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about atmospheric escape processes on all the planets, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Catling2009_SciAm.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a> - great layman-level reading material.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Water vapor in the atmosphere was split up by ultraviolet light. The hydrogen was light enough to escape into space, while the oxygen got locked up in rocks on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rocky planets with a molten iron core can <em>make and keep</em> their own water. Rocky planets without a molten iron core 'dry out' in space. The hydrogen floats away as solar radiation separates the oxygen and hydrogen. </p>
<p>Mars is a rocky planet that used to have a molten iron core. However because Mars is so small, that molten core cooled quicker than Earth's. Once the molten iron solidified and stopped swirling, Mars began to 'dry out'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Omars is pretty low on gravity and the parts that werent frozen permanently were evaporated yes, back out into space through a process called solar erosion. The sun produces solar winds, and those winds are literally blowing Mars atmosphere away at about 100g a  second, and multiply that by millions of years, and you can see why mars is so dry and has such a thin atmosphere. It doesn't happen here on earth because strong magnetic waves keep solar winds from stripping our atmosphere away.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add a few points that you may find interesting to the discussion. Cooling is directly related to surface area and inversely to the volume of the planet. As planets get larger their volume increases more in proportion to their surface area. Mars therefor cooled off quicker and lost tectonic activity which had many consequences like the cessation of producing a magnetic field and also the end of volcanic activity both of which contributed to the demise of Mar's atmosphere. Plus being smaller to start with meant that atmosphere was harder to hand onto anyways.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, through some process (internal core cooling or asteroid impact) the magnetic field for Mars has all but gone. This left the planet in a state of constant bombardment from radiation which decimated the atmosphere. This in turn dried out the planet. </p>
<p>I know, very simplified but it gets the point across. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
