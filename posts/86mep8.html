		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now, I'm not from the States, but in my country (and from what I have gathered from videos and pictures of police uniforms from policemen from different countries) the police uniform looks so restrictive, by that I mean they don't look stretchy or like you could run in them. Why? Surely those pants tear/sag when you're chasing down a criminal, and those shoes look far too bulky, they're probably uncomfortable or too heavy. Even the US secret service have to wait a suit and tie and stuff, wouldn't it be more suitable to wear something more athletic (like track pants and a knitted shirt). I know they're meant to look professional, but should practicality really be sacrificed for it?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite what you see on TV, police spend very little of their time chasing suspects on foot.  Distinctive clothing and comfortable walking shoes are far more important than being able to run.  Plus, they are wearing a belt with 10-20 lbs. of equipment on it, that's going to be a bigger impediment when running than tight pants.  </p>
<p>Also, many suspects are young and fit and will be able to outrun police anyway, relying on group tactics and communication is much more effective than footspeed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like the difference between a military dress uniform and a combat uniform.</p>
<p>Combat uniforms are meant to be comfortable, light weight, and practical.</p>
<p>Dress uniforms are meant to project conformity and authority.</p>
<p>It's the same with the police, it's not about being practical, it's about what message the uniform is sending. &quot;I'm in charge, respect my authority&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>90% of what police do is projecting the <em>appearance</em> of authority, safety, power, whatever.  Actually chasing down the bad guys is a last resort - most crimes are managed or prevented altogether just by the presence of police, rather than them actually having to do anything.</p>
<p>So the goal of a police uniform is to be distinctive, uniform, and to give the appearance of power.  After that's accomplished, functionality becomes important.  It's most important overall that people see a police officer walking down the street, or driving around town, and can instantly identify him, because that's what will make the average person say &quot;It's not worth doing this, I'll get caught.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well at least in my country, India, the police uniforms are a remnant of the colonial rule. The khaki uniforms used by the police are derived from the khaki uniforms that the sepoys of the British Indian Army started wearing back in the 19th century (iirc). </p>
<p>Also, imo a well-fitting suit allows you to easily run and jump, certainly not as much as say trackpants but it's not too restrictive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The outfit my fianc√© was given was definitely restrictive, but he has slowly replaced his pants to be more like army combat uniforms, and he's upgraded his boots as well to ones that are waterproof (WHY are the provided boots not waterproof?!) and got an outer carrier for his vest so that he wasn't sweating to death. He's had to chase a few people, and apparently jump a few fences, so his new stuff must be working. </p>
<p>His uniform now looks very similar to the one that was provided when he was hired, but it's very different, because he's replaced things over the time he's been on the job. I think that they contract uniforms from the lowest bidder. I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that they think those clothes are best, and has everything to do with the financial aspect of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
