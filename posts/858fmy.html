		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primarily because salt increases the conductivity of water. Rusting (or more generally oxidation) involves the transfer of electrons, which can happen more easily in a conductive medium. As I'm an engineer and not a chemist, I'm not sure if this qualifies as a catalyst; the presence of salt increases the reaction rate, but it's not really involved in the reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Halides in general destabilize the metal matrix, (namely the oxide layer) with lower atomic numbers being more reactive. In fact, florine atoms are used to etch both aluminum and steel prior to a variety of processes, and activates chemical conversion coatings. </p>
<p>While being less potent, its cousin, chlorine also does the same. If you replace the ions with something like acetate (and adjust the concentrations so that the conductivity of the two solutions are the same, and hold it in an atmosphere such that the dissolved oxygen content is the same), the metal wouldn't corrode nearly as fast. </p>
<p>It does behave like a catalyst, but I can only speculate as to its mechanism. Perhaps someone more qualified can chime in here. (because I would like to know as well)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Corrosion occurs between dissimilar in electrical contact with an electrolyte. 100% distilled water (pure H20) is not a conductor, what is conductive in normal tap water is the other ions inside. Salt dissolved in water is a pretty potent electrolyte, and allows for quite a bit of conduction.</p>
<p>Let's say you have steel and aluminum touching with no electrolyte, no flow of electrons can occur due to needing a complete circuit. Add an electrolyte, you now have a complete circuit, and can not start corroding. Humid air is sometimes all you need to get kickstarted.</p>
<p>A good example of this, is ship &quot;boneyards&quot; where they will place 10 or more boats side by side in electrical contact. They will place a generator across this electrical contact, and place a positive voltage across the opposite direction of where this electrical flow would be due to dissimilar metals. This counteracts the electrical flow, creating a net 0 voltage, and will prevent corrosion.</p>
<p>This is why it's so important to use similar metals when water piping is involved, as an electrolyte is always present. If you really want to speed this process up, Bleach is a good way to kick start this. This corrosion is known Galvanic Corrosion, and is sort of involved in battery physics for specific types of batteries.</p>
<p>Many applications will use sacrificial anodes to combat this. Essentially they will use a metal far away on the galvanic chart from the metal primary used in the application. This can help prevent corroding other dissimilar metals, as the sacrificial anode will take most of the corrosion. Since it's intended to be sacrificial, it's easy and cheap to replace.</p>
