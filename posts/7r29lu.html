		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, it's certainly a tradeoff.  But you can't just strike a match to a large magnesium block and set it aflame, it has to heat up to 900 F, which is very difficult to do for a substantial block of metal that conducts heat very well and is typically connected to other metal pieces that can act as heat sinks.  </p>
<p>So magnesium is actually quite safe, and it's really only a problem once a fire has already begun to rage (typically the fuel tank is ruptured as well).  For vehicles this is a reasonable tradeoff because most of the time occupants can exit, but you definitely wouldn't want to have a magnesium structure in a building.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason that it's relatively safe to make machined magnesium parts is because the surface area to volume ratio is very low.  Magnesium only ignites easily if it has a lot of surface area. You can buy magnesium fire starter blocks. The block will not burn,  but you can take a knife and shave off some magnesium, and that will burn well. The factories that produce milled magnesium parts have strict protocols on how to deal with the shavings and powder that are produced,  because they are very very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/tgPZL4hFNA0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/tgPZL4hFNA0</a></p>
<p>Larger magnesium blocks can also be set on fire if they are heated up enough.  Many large aircraft have magnesium blocks for the rotors in their brakes. This saves a great deal of weight in the final product,  but comes with a risk. If the brakes overheat,  they can burst into flame. </p>
<p>As a side note,  you can't put out a magnesium fire with water.  Magnesium burns hot enough to break the oxygen-hydrogen bonds in the water.  Then the hydrogen burns, and you get an explosion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TOpsB5n9DZ8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/TOpsB5n9DZ8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then the volunteer fire department showed up all drunk from their yearly picnic. Two of the guys just stood by the side looking at a porno magazine. The year was 1988.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Mag is a hardener used to make an alloy meaning the mag content of any metal used in car body parts is usually below 10%.

<p>Note, however, that it can't be done with a solid block; it has to be in a form with a large surface area/mass ratio. Same principle with magnesium. You'd have a hard time trying to ignite a car wheel, but a fine magnesium powder will go up in a flash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
