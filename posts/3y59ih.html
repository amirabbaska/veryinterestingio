		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bodies of cinema cameras are getting pretty small. But they still need to be big enough for a large sensor and a mount for high-end cine lenses, as well as inputs for sync and reference audio, and outputs for a external monitors and external recorders.</p>
<p>Attached to them will be a follow-focus, possibly an external recorder, viewfinder, and a matte box.</p>
<p>Plus, you want a bit of weight to it for steadier handheld shots. News stations still use big shoulder-mounted ENG cameras partly because the size and weight gives you steadier handheld shots than a small, light, handheld format.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
A lot if people are commenting that my post doesn't really ELI5.<br />
So I'm pasting one of my responses below that I think does a better job. THere are also a lot of other good responses if you scroll past the banter.  </p>
<p>The answer can get a little complicated because Television cameras and movie cameras are different. One of the big differences is that movie cameras have a smaller body with lots of attachments, whereas TV cameras (called ENG cameras) are a little bigger with have more of the features built-in. For movie (cinema or 'cine' for short) cameras, most of the size you are seeing is from the attachments.
But I'll try to summarize a better answer in 3 areas.  </p>
<p><strong>1 - Image Quality: Go Pro cannot paint a picture as well as Bigger Cameras can</strong>. </p>
<p>The image quality of a go pro is not particularly good compared to pro cameras because there is more to image quality than 4k resolution.<br />
Compression, bit depth, noise floor, and colour subsampling are all fancy terms you may not know, but they all contribute to making an image good or bad. A user does a good job of comparing it to painting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3y59ih/eli5_if_a_handheld_gopro_can_record_at_4k/cyax11t" target="_blank">here.</a>.  </p>
<p>Professional movie and tv cameras need to be heavier and bigger than a go pro because they need bigger 'eyes' (called a sensor) and a bigger 'brain' (processing) and to keep those big eyes and brain cooler.  </p>
<p><strong>2 - Lens - the viewpoint of the camera.</strong>. </p>
<p>Go pros have only one 'viewpoint' of the world: a very wide fish-eye view that only sees well in bright light. If you want to see something far away, you need eyes more like an eagle, or like a person with binoculars. If you want to see things in the dark, you need eyes that gather more light, like a raccoon's eyes or a person with night vision goggles. Movie cameras are made so that when you want one of those other views, you can swap the lens to a different one. TV cameras have the ability to zoom in and out very far, as well as to 'put on sunglasses' built right into them.<br />
These abilities require some heavy glass and solid mounting for that glass.  </p>
<p><strong>3 - Practical concerns like inputs/outputs, controls, weight and balance, and professional appearance</strong>.  </p>
<p>There's a lot in this category. But professionals need to be able to record audio (another word for sound), and they might need to be able to show their boss (a director or producer) what is happening. So they need jacks for cables to go in and out. Professionals need a lot of controls to tell the camera what they want it to do in different conditions, and they need space on the camera for those controls. The camera also needs some wight to it and be well balanced for a pro to get a steady handheld shot. Sometimes crews even add weights to a camera 'rig' to get the balance right. TV news cameramen also find that they are seen as more professional and get more respect with a full sized camera than a smaller one.  </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resolution is not everything. Sensor size matters too. For each sensor pixel, the bigger it is, the better it can sense light. That means that there will likely be less noise than a smaller sized sensor, especially at night.</p>
<p>Then there is something called latitude. Latitude is the ability of the sensor to still perceive detail even in bright lights or very dark shadows. The ARRI Alexa cinema camera has about 14 stops of latitude, making it much more useful than something like an entry level DSLR, which might have 5, or 7. It makes the job of lighting significantly easier, especially in post production.</p>
<p>Then there is the ability to record in Log, Raw, etc. Raw requires a lot of processing power to shoot, especially in 4k. This requires power, and fast processors and drives to do.</p>
<p>Then there is ease of use. Putting on something like a follow focus system, a matte box, a monitor, EVF, battery pack, etc. is very easy to do with an Alexa. The menu is fairly simple too. Lenses, which are of the utmost importance, are quick to change out, and are much easier to change than on something like a GoPro.</p>
<p>Camera movements, whether they are on a Chapman Leonard dolly, or just sticks with a fluid drag head, will be significantly smoother than what a GoPro would be able to do. Pretty much every GoPro video you see that looks smooth, likely was shot in 4k, and then stabilized in After Effects. GoPro footage never looks that smooth directly off camera.</p>
<p>Basically, there are a lot of reasons. But the best reason is, it's just easier to do, and it usually looks better in the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My attempt to truly ELI5 (this took a lot time to trim down):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GoPro <strong>&quot;squishes&quot;</strong> video to make it fit into small SD cards. Big cameras do not, so editors can greatly control color in the video to add style/convey emotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GoPro can't see very <strong>bright</strong>, or very <strong>dark</strong> things. Big cameras can. Big cameras can also show darker/brighter parts of a single image, allowing for beautiful/detailed shots of sunsets for example. GoPros will show a sunset as a single, &quot;blown out&quot; spot, while Pro cameras show all the subtle detail our eyes can see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GoPro doesn't have interchangeable <strong>lenses</strong>. With control over a lens, you also have control over what is in focus in the video. Focus control is the first big thing audiences distinguish between &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;amateur&quot; video. A video with the actor in focus, but his background tastefully blurred (out of focus) creates <strong>depth and separation</strong>. GoPros are also stuck with a very <strong>wide</strong> view of the world. Lenses allow filmmakers to chose how wide, or narrow they'd like their shots to be. Lenses can also allow cameras to see very distant, or very tiny objects with stunning detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GoPros can't connect to all the cool <strong>accessories</strong> that filmmakers need. Special accessories allow filmmakers to have much longer battery life, provide focus control to a separate operator, help stabilize the camera, record professional sound, provide bigger screens with built in tools to help set focus/exposure, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>There are a <strong>millionbillion</strong> other reasons, but these are some of the basics.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, resolution (number of pixels recorded) is only one of the measures of quality of an image. The larger cameras can provide better quality images in a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sensor size - the larger the sensor, the more 'cinematic' the image looks because of the shallow depth of field (soft backgrounds whilst foregrounds are sharp).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic range - the dark shadows like the shade under a tree is clear, but so is the blinding sun. One of the biggest challenges in digital cinematography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality of recording - resolution is not the only thing. Chroma subsampling (the amount of 1s and 0s dedicated to colour), colour range, bitrate (the mbps) all factor in too - bigger cameras can do more (smaller cameras can too but they need to be hooked in to high quality recording devices).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base ISO - Bigger cameras with bigger sensors can do better in low light. They can shoot in near darkness, and the image will be clean - as a general rule, dark images without adequate light are grainy - but the graininess 'kicks in' later on high ISO cameras. That said, cameras don't have to be 'huge' to have a high base ISO - the highest ISO cameras like the Sony a7sII are quite small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to change lenses - big lenses mean brighter images, sharper images, and more even images 'edge to edge'. Bigger lenses need bigger cameras (most of the time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Battery and power - all the above mean the cameras churn through batteries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessories - All sorts of bits and pieces hanging off the camera allow the filmmakers to accurately measure things, and provide fine tune manual control. A lot of cinematography is done extremely manually - technicians are so highly trained that they can do things like focusing by hand with much more nuance than electronic equipment can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build quality - bigger cameras are battle ready for filming.</p>
</li>
<li>Integration into existing tripods/dollies/cranes - To be honest, big cinema digital cameras don't have to be as big as they are. But cameras like the Alexa (a common 'Hollywood camera') are matched in size to the old 35mm cameras (which had to be large because they had 400 feet of film attached to them) just so everyone can keep using their gear in the same way.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you work with higher end cameras, you start to see a lot that the cheaper cameras can't do. That said, cheaper and smaller cameras are optimised to give a very crunchy, saturated and 'flashy' image. They'll lack the subtlety of higher end cameras, but that said, they often will look great. Just because a higher end camera <em>can</em> look better doesn't mean it always does. There's plenty of people out there shooting better stuff on their phones than pros are with all the big toys.</p>
<p>If you're making a low budget film, your money is better spent going with the 'cheap' gear (because cheap gear nowadays is absolutely amazing) and putting your money towards every possible other element of the film.</p>
<p>At the end of the days quality of images goes up with camera size and price. But there are limits. I'm currently shooting a film on DSLR (bigger than GoPro, smaller than cinema) when we could have easily afforded pricier cinema equipment. We did it because that camera choice best suited our film.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GoPros have a fixed focal length. The are designed to  show things close to the lens in focus but if you try to shoot something from far away you'll see things get blurry quickly. This doesn't mean the GoPro is poor quality, it's just designed to do a specific thing really well (and my GoPro certainly does it well.)</p>
<p>Movie and TV cameras on the other hand need to be able to focus on things that are close or far or in between and this requires large lenses. They also have large covers called shrouds that only allow light coming from the thing the camera is pointed at to enter the lens. This is helpful for outdoor shots like sporting events. </p>
<p>In addition to that there are lots of other bulky add-ons that help the camera operators like built in monitors; large, easy to grip handles with zoom and focus controls. GoPros only have a few buttons to save space and it makes changing settings very time consuming. With large body cameras all the settings can have their own switches and dials and experience operators can make changes very quickly which can be crucial for live events. </p>
<p>For really large cameras there are even motion-assist devices built in that allow the operator to make really smooth camera movements. </p>
<p>When you control the shooting environment there's no need to make things small. You make then the the size that is the easiest to use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
