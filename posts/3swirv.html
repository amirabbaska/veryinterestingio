		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a complex issue but I'll do my best to ELI5.</p>
<p>Risk factors for suicide are much higher for men than they are for women. These include severe mental illness, substance abuse, access to lethal means, and a higher rate of overtly aggressive behaiours. Furthermore, there are far fewer supports available for men than there are for women (e.g., if a woman's husband kicks her out of the home, there are likely women's shelters nearby, not so for men). The supports that are available to men are much less likely to be used due to stigma and stereotype surrounding men seeking help in relation to their distress, depression, grief, bereavement, etc.
The social aspect of support also comes into play here. Women are more likely than men to have a social group with whom they feel comfortable discussing their problems and experiences of low mood. We see this in the divorce literature that demonstrates post-divorce depression to be significantly higher in males than in females. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, men have higher rates of suicide risk factors and fewer protective factors against suicide attempt and completion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting, but women are more likely to attempt to commit suicide than men, but men are more likely to die from their attempt. The difference comes from the methods of attempted suicide. Men are much more likely to use methods that are immediately lethal, like jumping or shooting themselves, while women use methods that don't kill them for awhile, like overdosing on pills. Thus, women stand a better chance of being found and saved than men and are less likely to die as a result.</p>
<p>Edit: some people have been asking for a source, and why men are more likely to kill themselves using more lethal methods. Here's a paper that discusses the topic: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539603/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539603/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert of any sort but I think on some level it has to be influenced by the cultural acceptance of men's struggles with depression and other mental health issues. As a man who was diagnosed with clinical depression I can say I waited too long to get help because I was afraid of appearing weak or incapable; I suffered with something that could have been easily treated because I felt like it wasn't okay to admit what was going on, and that festered for years and years until I finally got help. Like I said before, I'm no expert but I think that is an influencing factor.</p>
<p>Edit: wanted to thank the redditor who gave me good for this comment. I'm happy that others have liked what I had to say and hope that anyone who may be in a similar position I was in years ago sees this and knows they aren't alone in feeling the way they are and they don't have to feel that way. Please seek out help; the difference between feeling sad, angry, blank, apathetic and hopeless or happiness/peace isn't as hard as you think. You're not alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is so much pressure on men these days to be the best of the best.  Coupled with the huge stigma of seeking help for mental illness that men are cornered between a rock and a hard place just for being male.  Feminism has really skewed the way society looks at men these days.  And yes, I am aware I will get down voted but I don't care.  I am not saying it's a war but in terms of mental illness men without a fact have it much, much worse.  </p>
<p>If a male is emotional, he is told to &quot;man up&quot; &quot;quit being a fag&quot; and to &quot;stop being a pussy&quot;.  I've lost jobs and relationships because I disclosed my depression.  This just isn't in my head.  It's a real thing that happens all the time.  </p>
<p>Homelessness for men vs women.  Men are at higher risk for homelessness.  Women have shelters, clinics, rehabs specifically for women.  They are also more likely to win in court and custody cases.  There's no battered men's shelter despite the fact that domestic male abuse victim reports are on the rise.</p>
<p>If you're a single mom in society, you can easily ride the dole while collecting alimony, government checks, and child support.  If you're a single male you are SOL in terms of assistance.  I've tried to apply to gov't assistance multiple times, especially food stamps.  I only qualified for $16 a month.  What am I supposed to do with that?  I know for a fact that those minorities who pop out babies left and right collect thousands in government checks a month. </p>
<p>Relationships, women almost always have the upper hand.  Please read what I mean before clicking the downvote icon.  Online dating is a huge these, like more people than ever meet online than before.  Women, always, without a doubt 100% of the time have the upper hand.  It's so hard for men to meet women these days.  Again, with the inclusion of online dating, which is mostly just window shopping for women(it's true, don't fucking tell me otherwise).  A man has so much competition these days, even just to get a fucking response on dating sites is a god send for most men.  If a woman doesn't like the way you look it's &quot;oh don't settle for him girl, you can find a man that looks better, just swipe left girl, he doesn't make enough&quot;  Swipe left like you are nothing more than a prize in a display case.  It's humiliating and degrading.  I work really hard to make a good, outstanding profile.  I try to stay in decent shape, I could lose a few pounds more but I've already lost about 80lbs.  You can't win basically.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a male who's been suicidal for 10 years.  Multiple failed attempts under my belt.
Edit: Added in my point about relationships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
