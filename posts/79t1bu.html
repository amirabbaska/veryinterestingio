		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paper involves interwoven fibers. When you cut paper, you create edges that don't shuffle back together in their original interwoven structure if you push them against each other, so the edges don't stick.</p>
<p>A simpler material shows that recombination can happen though: a block of aluminum. If you cut aluminum in half, you can't just press the halves back together and get your block back, because the brand new edges are exposed to air and form a new oxide layer. However, if you polish the halves in a vacuum, you <em>can</em> just push the blocks together and they just become one block. This is the principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_welding" target="_blank">cold welding</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Cold welding aside</strong>. As others have mentioned it depends very much so on the molecular nature of the substance. You cut a piece of paper, or wood, or metal in half and you've broken one whole solid network/mesh of molecules (arranged in a repetitious manner) into two pieces. You simply can't put them back together because the molecular interactions that make such solids a whole are <em>continuous</em> and are formed in either high-energy processes or continuous/progressive chemical interplay.</p>
<p>Now say you take some butter or a piece of putty. That is a solid but it's structure is not defined by a high-energy network of specifically organised molecules. It's a bunch of the &quot;stuff&quot; and all it needs for two wholes of it to become one is for clumps of smaller groups of molecules to be put together in any arrangement with sufficient mechanical force. It's more of a Sea of molecules of similar properties so to speak. Different molecules/elements interact in different ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many organic substances (paper, wood, rubber etc) and plastics consist of long chain molecules which bind to each other and in cases like rubber are very much interwoven.  If you cut them you create an edge and if you move the parts back together the molecules will never line up at the appropriate scale in a way that will give them significant attractive forces, also air and things will get in the way.  Adhesives stick to themselves better, at least in a gel like state.</p>
<p>Metals on the other hand will just glue back together if you cut them apart and put them back together UNLESS they corrode in that time, bend them out of shape or (again) air gets in the way, which happens unless you are in a vacuum.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you can.  At the molecular level, crystalline solids look a lot like a large block of those buckyball magnets.  Pull them apart, and they like to break in clean planes.  Get them aligned just right, and they snap back together.</p>
<p>Of course, Oxidization happens to any exposed surface, think of that like throwing a hand full of different diameter spherical magnets in the mix.  All of a sudden the two pieces don't line up exactly anymore, and won't cold weld back together.</p>
<p>Non-crystalline solids are even more different.  think of a woven matrix of strings of those same buckyball magnets.  Pulling them apart causes the strings to break more randomly, sticking to other strands in the middle, or re-connecting to the ends of other broken strands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
