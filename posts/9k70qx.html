		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's simply down to different styles of editing and filming. Different cameras and settings affect how crisp the footage is and how much motion blur it has (that can also be done in editing).
I've also noticed British shows tend to be more grey and American shows more colourful, likely as a result both of artistic choices in set and prop design and also colour grading (artificially altering the colours of recorded footage to be more or less vibrant, or even appear as other colours).
Overall I think it's just choices by the crew of the show to have it look a certain way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brits have a different frame rate to the US</p>
<p>In the UK, TV is broadcasted at 25 frames per second (this was called PAL)
Whereas in the US, TV is at 29.97 frames per second (this was called NTSC)
(PAL and NTSC are the formats of old colour TV broadcasts. The reason I refer to them here is because they were the formats that made TV localised)</p>
<p>If you don’t know what frames per second means, here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p>Think of 1 whole second of a film. In the UK that second is made up of 25 different images, placed next to each other.
In the US, 1 second of film will have 29.97 images to flick through. </p>
<p>You don’t see these images jumping to the next because they move too fast for our brains to process. However if the frame rate is lower, let’s say 10 frames per second, you will be able to see most frames jump to the next depending on how much movement there is between those frames. </p>
<p>The difference between 25 frames and 29 frames is really very subtle, but you can be sensitive to that difference. The blurriness you’re referring to might just be that you are so used to seeing 29 frames per second, that seeing 25 frames per second would come across as blurry. </p>

<p>ELI5: The brits have less pictures in the TV. </p>
<p>EDIT: This also works vice versa. Brits may think American TV looks blurry just because it’s filmed in a different frame rate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
