<p>Of course it might vary by state and by whatever agency granted the loan (federal vs state vs whatever), but the basic pattern of &quot;this person owes us money&quot; doesn't change much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said, it is very different than say defaulting on your mortgage, car, etc...</p>
<p>They will practically beg you to set up any kind of payment plan and will be extremely helpful. Continued deferment is easy...</p>
<p>I ran into some financial issues after grad school. They sent letters, emails, and called weekly... I won't go into too much detail but when I finished grad school I had a family to support, mortgage, vehicles... you know, you could almost say I was your average person. I was extremely intimidated because employment opportunities were much slimmer than I expected and those available at the time were not nearly as lucrative, it was a scary spot. After a couple of months really struggling and flat out avoiding the student loan people I sucked it up and called them. I Had almost no experience dealing with creditors so I was scared but walked away from that phone call actually feeling much better about my situation. They were almost unreasonably flexible and accommodating, they know that their expectations on paper are unreasonable in practice a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was a few years ago and I have had to call to adjust payment plan a couple of times since but it's almost like they don't actually care if you're paying as long as you communicate with them.</p>
<p>This student loan bubble will burst at some point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR person thinks if you don’t have a job, even if spouse does, you don’t have to pay back loans </p>
<p>So I know someone who has 30K+ in loans for a degree thats not even finished. They stopped taking classes bc they got pregnant, got a deferral while they were on FMLA after having that baby. Well turn out they never told loan people they were off FMLA, they just had their 2nd baby and are quitting their job. Their theory is that if they don’t have a job (but are married and spouse works) that they don’t have to pay back the loans.
Many people have tried to explain that’s not how it works but they don’t believe them. Am I wrong or will they be majorly screwed once loans catch up with them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the jurisdiction.  Ontario as an example, after 15 years the debt is written off.  They found the debt to be a hindrance to growing the economy and a great way to target those who really needed help paying for post-secondary education.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
