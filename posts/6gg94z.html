<p>When you get pulled over, most people hope to get off with just a warning, and part of that is being polite and respectful.  Lying is impolite, and will likely get you a ticket, but leave open the option of contesting it in court.  Telling the truth (assuming you were speeding or something) is a confession, the officer might respect your honesty and give you a warning, but if they don't, it will be more difficult to contest the ticket.</p>
<p>Also, like any open-ended question, it helps gauge your level of nervousness and/or intoxication, to help the officer determine if you are breaking any other laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: this post was locked way too soon. We're cops with thick skin, we can handle it. Sorry to those I didn't get to answer your questions. </p>
<p>Law enforcement here. Such a question is done for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>First off and probably most important is to establish a dialogue to accertain the persons level of nervousness. Almost everybodies nervous when they get pulled over, however, through experience you quickly start to tell the difference between the type of nervousness that's &quot;oh shit, I'm about to get a ticket&quot; and &quot;fuck, I hope he doesn't find the brick of cocaine in the trunk&quot; and most importantly &quot;should I pull out my gun and shoot this pig&quot; this question usually leads to follow up questions and gives you a baseline of what type of person you're dealing with really quickly and if they might be a threat and if you need to call for backup. Please understand that we may ask you silly, even obvious questions. And sometimes people get really offended when asked where they are going. We don't give a shit where you're going personally, we are painting a picture trying to decide if you're engaging in something more than a simple traffic stop or if you're about to stick a gun in our face. I have asked people what they have for breakfast. It's all about that baseline and observing people's responses to questions they won't usually lie about, vs questions they will lie about. </p>
<p>Secondly, as some have already said, it puts you on the spot and might elicit a confession. As police, we have a lot of encounters with a lot of people and when we get called to court which is sometimes months down the road, most of the time we only have our notes to remind us of these traffic stops (who has time to pull and watch dash cams for a simple traffic ticket that your salary isn't dependent on). If someone comes right off the bat and admits they were speeding, you write that in your notes and at court you get to say, I don't recall our conversation but according to my notes, the person admitted they were speeding. Boom, guilty. </p>
<p>Another thing, which is probably more of a preference thing, you want to get an idea on what the persons attitude is. As a police officer (and I'll be honest, some take a long time to realize this, some never realize it) the biggest power you have is the power of discretion. Personally, I always took the attitude of 'what did the person do to get themselves in this situation, and what kind of response is needed from me to get them to correct it&quot; </p>
<p>So what I mean by this, when you pull over somebody and they start to downplay why you pulled them over, you're obviously going to have a measured response against that. For example, you pull somebody over in a construction zone for speeding. They start telling you something like, &quot;well I didn't see any workers&quot;. That's somebody that NEEDS to see a ticket, plus the double fine that construction zone usually brings. That's somebody that clearly doesn't realize how many construction workers and other personnel die every year because of people like them. Where as if somebody responds like, &quot;yes I'm sorry. I realize I was going to fast in a construction zone, I got complacent&quot;, you can say to yourself that they probably feel bad enough getting pulled over and may likely, at the very least, slow down in the future going through construction zones, so you can just give a simple warning or at least not tack on the construction zone enhancement. </p>
<p>Most cops do have a pet peeve though. For example, children jumping around in a vehicle. Don't give a damn want the excuse is, your getting a ticket Everytime. Seat belts and car seats. No other excuse is getting you out of that one. I can't even start to get into how horrifying any type of crime scene is when it involves children, especially motor vehicle accidents. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cop here. From the UK, so I've already seen your comments about being scared of men with guns, I don't have one. </p>
<p>The answer is different reasons. </p>
<p>I'm not a traffic cop. I don't even carry a ticket book, so if I do stop someone, pretty much 99 percent of the time, it's going to be advice and a warning only. </p>
<p>I therefore ask that question as it gives me an insight into what sort of person in dealing with. </p>
<p>&quot;I'm really sorry Officer, I was speeding because...&quot; they are admitting their fault, apologising, being polite - no need to spend to much time here as they know exactly what they've done, a quick warning and they are off. </p>
<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot; If it's clear they WILL know, I now know I'm dealing with someone whose willing to lie to me. It's not going to change the outcome, it'll still be a warning, but this time I'm on my guard a little more and on the lookout in case they are hiding something else - probably more likely to run a few checks on them before they go in case there are other issues. </p>
<hr />
<p>However... Traffic Officers may well be asking that question, fully intending to give you a ticket, hoping for the admission as then it's less likely you will contend the ticket! </p>
<p>There's no &quot;right&quot; answer. However, for me (and remember I'm in the UK, I'm not sure how different it is in the US) if I am stopped whilst driving (I have been twice since being in the job) , I'll always admit to what I've done, purely because I know that if the traffic officer wants to give a ticket, they already have the evidence to - if I say &quot;I don't know&quot; it doesn't actually help me in the slightest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the member of public you can never really know the right way to play it without knowing what the cops intention is as he's walking over to your car. Politeness regardless of the choice never, ever hurts though! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've noticed that they don't ask why they pulled you over in California.</p>
<p>It's almost always something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Cop lights me up, I pull over to the right shoulder (not the left; I'm not an idiot.) Turn on dome light, turn off radio, open driver and passenger window, shut of engine.]</p>
<p>Cop: Good evening. Can I see you drivers license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance please?</p>
<p>Me: Good evening. I have my license in my pocket. My registration and insurance is in my glovebox. [hand them to the cop].</p>
<p>Cop: Thanks. I'll be right back.</p>
<p>[Cop spends about 5-10 minutes at his car. Returns with a yellow paper.]</p>
<p>Cop: The reason I stopped you is that my LIDAR indicated you were traveling at 51 miles per hour coming down that hill back there. The posted speed limit is 40 miles per hour. This is a written warning, not a citation. If you have any questions, there's a phone number right here and the specific vehicle code is right here. Have a good night, slow it down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-or-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cop: The reason I stopped you is that I observed you making a left turn while failing to yield to an oncoming vehicle. I'm citing you for this infraction. Please sign here at the bottom. This is not an admission of guilt. It's a promise to appear at the courthouse listed here on the date and time listed here. If you intend to appear, you'll need to call this number prior to this date and let them know. If you have any questions, there's instructions on the back and there's a phone number right here and the specific vehicle code is right here. Have a good night, and next time, don't cut off a cop.</p>
