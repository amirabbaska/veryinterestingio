		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your taste is music builds from what you are exposed to. The more you listen to a certain genre, the more you will get used to the sounds and rhythms contained in that genre and enjoy it. Say, you don't like jazz music. If you were to listen to jazz everyday for a year, you would love jazz by the end of that year. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, finally - something I know a little bit about.</p>
<p>Music actually has a funny way of entering the brain, in that it causes most parts of the brain to activate. Because it hits almost every fundamental part of the brain, the neuroplasticity of the cells enable a sort of imprint of the music into our processing. The music becomes part of a fundamental reward pathway of what's pleasant equating to what is good for survival. What's really interesting about this is, because music is one of the most fundamental 'keys' to accessing memory - those with dementia and degenerative mental disorders can actually be treated using music from their childhood. The first places to be hit by music, are also the last to go.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a psychology question, in other words neuroscience from the top down instead of bottom up.</p>
<p>Identity is a major reason. People choose certain music to represent them, to show they can relate to certain other groups of people. </p>
<p>If you go to a country music festival, there's gonna be a lot of people who either do relate or would like to relate to the experience of living in the country or a small town. If you want to appear fearsome, or have a lot of pent up negativity, you might go for music that sounds violent (e.g. metal) or tortured (Nine Inch Nails) or dominating (Gangsta Rap). If you want to fit in, well, there's pop music!</p>
<p>There's also more practical reasons.</p>
<p>If your a professor, you better like something erudite and critically acclaimed like classical, experimental music, jazz, or something obscure but lauded like traditional Indian music (assuming your white).</p>
<p>People listen to happy and sad music for the same reason fundamentally, to feel better. You go for happy if that's your current state and your afraid something will upset it. Sad if you're feeling crappy and want to extinguish the bad emotions. </p>
<p>For most though, fitting in is the most important part. Most people do not especially care for music as art, the same way most people don't have a favorite style of painting or poetry. For them the social aspect of music is above the music itself, which is OK.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(33 now)Its weird growing up in canada i always listened to rock..hiphop..i moved to europe at 21..since then iv fallen in love with trance. To most people its just thumping..to me its like listening to a orchestra,i hear every subtle note and have gained a great appreciation for it.(i ended up working for a trance record label for 6 years) My holiday in ibiza exposed me to it first..never looked back. So as what the top comment said,its what your exposed to most..you learn the intricacies of what makes it great and you start to hear things that others may miss . whatever genre it may be </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
