		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maths behind raytracing isn't too complex. You work out where a beam of light hits a surface, and then you work what direction it bounces to etc. The problem is that you have a <em>lot</em> of rays of light to deal with, and that gets computationally expensive.</p>
<p>So what you do is you run the calculations in <em>parallel</em>. That is, instead of having one processor chip doing one ray at a time, you have several chips running one ray each at the same time, and that speeds things a up a lot.</p>
<p>Now, this is where you have a choice. You can either use a small number of expensive but fast chips with lots of features, or you can use a large number of cheap but slower chips with minimal features. Which is better depends on a lot of things, but mostly on how complex your problem is, and how easy it is to split up your problem into small chunks. If the chips have to do a lot of communication with each after to solve the equations, then it's usually better to have a small number of fast chips. But if the chips can solve the equations independently of each other, then it's usually better to have a large number of cheap chips.</p>
<p>Raytracing is one the best examples of the second type. The maths for the rays can all be done independently, and the equations are actually pretty simple. So what you want is a large number of cheap chips. <em>And that is what a graphics card is</em>. Your computer might have 2-16 expensive &quot;CPU&quot; processor chips, but a GPU (a graphics card) might have hundreds or thousands of cheap &quot;GPU&quot; processor chips. So, for these particular problems, the GPU solves them much much faster.</p>
<p>Additionally, because people use GPUs for problems like raytracing so often, they can actually hard-code some of the maths onto the chip to make it extra fast. So if you're doing something like matrix multiplication, which involves several steps of additional and multiplication, you'd normally have to do each of those steps one at a time, sending the results back and forth each time, storing things in memory along the way etc. A GPU might have a special section dedicated to matrix multiplication, so you send in a chunk of data and it spits out the result extremely fast without having to go through the intermediate steps.</p>
<p>But the key thing is that a GPU is a big pile of cheap processors, and that's often a lot faster than a small pile of expensive processors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RTX has the new RT cores specifically designed for &quot;much faster calculation of the intersection of a ray with objects stored in a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), a popular data structure for representing objects in ray tracers.&quot; Even then, the ray-traced result is still very noisy. nVidia solved that by using their new Optix AI Denoiser running on RTX's faster Tensor cores. We have seen the demos, and they are quite good; however, we'll see how it will actually perform in new titles, see whether the frame rate will hold up or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the real question should be: how the new RTX and Raytracing tech is different and better than the previous generations?</p>
<p>I mean the whole thing about physics was handled by Nvidia's Physx and idea of army of cheap GPU core are the same. I always feel like it is not a new ground breaking tech, they just make it better. (I.e more CUDA core, bigger bandwith, or higher clock or smaller the transitors)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The raytracing algorithm is pretty simple. Generally speaking:</p>
<p>1) For each pixel, fire a ray into the game world for some number of bounces or total distance.</p>
<p>2) Collide the ray with game objects -reflecting, refracting, and diffusing depending on the material. This causes the original ray to bounce and split.</p>
<p>3) Paint the pixel based on the color of everything the ray touched. Maybe also contribute bounce lighting to the color of objects based on other objects the ray touched.</p>
<p>4) Do this many millions of times -usually in parallel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In layman's terms - it takes a ray - a point of origin and a direction basically - and runs through a big list of bounding boxes in the scene, one for each object, to see if the ray intersects it. When a ray does hit an object, it runs through a list of all the triangles in the object and if the ray intersects any of them (ray/triangle intersection is the part that RTX cards have specialized hardware for), it picks the one closest to the origin. At this point it also calculates the orientation of the surface at the intersection (called a Normal) and maybe some other data. It forwards this location and orientation and other data to the small program that fired it in the first place, called a shader, which does something with it. Perhaps it shoots another bunch of rays based on that information and the material (called in graphical lingo a BRDF, a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, which decides what direction any more rays might be shot) of the object. Or perhaps it was just a shadow ray and it just counts them to see how many hit a light. Programmers decide what happens here.</p>
<p>All this doesn't happen sequentially of course, but in parallel, and the lists of objects and triangles are organized into efficient data structures (called Bounding Volume Hierarchies - there are various kinds of these, and I don't know which one nVidia uses) that can be searched quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
