		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/type-ii-collagen/" target="_blank">Examine.com</a> references some claims about this. </p>
<p>Some scientists believe that the protein chains in collagen are not fully broken down into individual amino acids, but rather that they can be absorbed by the body as so-called oligo-peptides before they are fully broken down. </p>
<p>Peptides are mini &quot;proteins&quot; that are made from only a handful of amino acids. In this particular case they believe that the body absorbs peptides containing two or three amino acids bonded together. </p>
<p>After eating them, these peptides have been observed to be concentrated in parts of the body where collagen is produced and repaired. This may suggest that the body can use them to make collagen in some more efficient and direct way than if it were to use the free amino acids themselves. Circulating di- and tripeptides could perhaps also have various medical effects themselves, acting as signal molecules rather than as raw material.</p>
<p>When collagen is digested, the peptides formed are primarily made from the amino acids glycine, proline and hydroxy-proline. Most protein sources will give a rather mixed soup of such things with all kinds of amino acid scrambled, but with a purified protein like collagen where the chains are very repetitive, you could in principle end up with something that has very different effects from normal mixed dietary protein. Especially if one were to consume it on an empty stomach or in large amounts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found a BMJ study in snakes that suggests collagen is broken down enough by stomach enzymes to be absorbed.</p>
<p>Collagen is predominantly rich in only two amino acids though, so it would be better to have a protein source rich in as many essential amino acids as you can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of amino acids as a variety of different LEGO blocks.  Different proteins are made up of different configurations with this set of blocks.  Collagen and whey, just as an example, will have some blocks that are the same, as well as some that are in only one or the other, between the two.  Metabolically, or in our body, thereâ€™s not much difference though - most of the proteins we eat contain the amino acids our body needs to build its own proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
