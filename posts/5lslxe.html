		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - Salt doesn't make ice colder.  What you're going for in both cases is a state change - you want liquid water, not solid water (ice) - without having to compromise the temperature.</p>
<p>Unless you have some continuous source of coolant (like my buddies at work that used to make iced cream with Liquid Nitrogen, lol) the ice you have is all the coolant you'll get, so you'll want to freeze the iced cream quickly before the elements warm the coolant (ice/water) beyond usefulness.  </p>
<p>In order to best transfer the heat away from the ingredients into the ice, you want the <em>highest possible surface area</em> of the spinning aluminum container to contact the coolant.  Ice cubes aren't that great, crushed ice or party ice is better (smaller chunks), but ultimately liquid is best.  You could use glycol or something, but the most available and safest liquid is water.  If you want to get water cold enough to freeze the iced cream without freezing into a solid block itself, you have to add salt to lower the freezing point.  Fun fact, ice rinks use a salt water (brine) which run through pipes in the concrete beneath the ice surface in order to maintain the temperature at around 19 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Salt does the same think to ice on sidewalks, except the motivation there is that you just don't want solid water (ice) around.  Liquid water will flow away and reduce the hazard/obstacle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're not making the ice colder in the ice cream machine.  In both cases your goal is to make liquid water colder, but the reasons for wanting colder liquid water are different.  </p>
<p>In the case of the ice cream maker, there's always at least a thin layer of liquid between the cream container and the solid ice, so colder liquid water means more heat transfers out of the ice cream and into the liquid water (so the ice cream freezes fast enough to freeze the air bubbles into the mix which is why ice cream has such great texture).  </p>
<p>In the case of the sidewalks, colder liquid water means more ice melts and flows off the sidewalk and melting continues at lower temperatures, reducing the slipping hazard.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are both the same reason!  It's a really good question.</p>
<p>Salt makes the freezing point of water lower.  That means when you throw it on ice, it tends to melt the ice.  Even in the Ice Cream machine.  What happens is the solid =&gt; liquid process (melting) requires a small amount of energy (the heat of fusion) even if the temperature stays the same.</p>
<p>In the sidewalk case, the large heat capacity of the sidewalk, driveway, Earth under the ice, ... gives up this heat without changing temperature.</p>
<p>In the Ice Cream machine case, the ice is insulated from a large source of heat (by the ice cream machine's bucket).  This means there is no good source of heat and the heat of fusion much come from the ice and the ice cream inside the can.  The ice melts faster, even though it is driving the temperature down from the melting poinf of plain ice to the melting point of ice in salt water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt lowers the melting point of water.</p>
<p>As a result of this, some of it melts. </p>
<p>Something people don't often consider about the act of melting ice is that it takes energy. To change ice at 0C into water at 0C, you need to add about 333Kj/Kg of water, which is quite a bit. This energy has to come from somewhere, and since everywhere is cold, somewhere has to get colder. </p>
<p>This means both the water that's formed and the remaining ice cool off to make up for the difference in energy, and because converting a kilo of ice to water takes about the same amount of energy as heating that water from 0C to 80C, the temperature drop is quite steep for a given amount of water formed.</p>
<p>This is also why the salted ice cube challenge is stupid. You're pressing ~-20C water up against your skin, frostbite is fast at that temperature with that much thermal conductivity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the case of the streets, it means that the water will remain liquid at lower temperatures. In the case of the ice cream, it makes the ice slurry colder without freezing solid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
