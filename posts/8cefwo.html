		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earliest record I could find was 1648, where Blaise Pascal convinced his brother-in-law Florin Perier to take a barometer up the mountain Puy de Dome, where they gathered the first data showing decreasing air pressure with altitude. By the mid 19th century, we had ballonists up to 10km, which is 6.2 miles; I'm not sure how they did that without oxygen supplementation that air would be very thin.</p>
<p>AFAICT, this knowledge was incrementally acquired over a period of time through various observations like the above. Also during this period (1662-1834), you had Boyle''s Law, Charles's Law, Avogadro;s Law, Ideal Gas Law all get articulated. These laws addressed volume &amp; pressure, volume &amp; temperature, volume &amp; #molecules, pressure &amp; volume &amp; #molecules &amp; temperature, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you say no oxygen what you mean is no air, right?</p>
<p>The first Western scientist to conclude that there is a vacuum between Earth and Moon was apparently Otto von Guericke in 1650. He concluded this because he was able to construct a vacuum pump. A vacuum pump can suck the air out of a container such that there is a vacuum in the container. For a long time people thought it was impossible to create a vacuum. They thought there must always be something. And it is indeed not easy to create a vacuum but it's possible.</p>
<p>Now how did von Guericke conclude that there must be a vacuum in space from his vacuum pump? Well at this point people already knew about gravitation and they knew that air has some weight. If you combine these two facts you come to the conclusion that the air that is higher up puts pressure on the air below, because the air high above weighs something. This means that the air is denser near the ground because it is pressed tight. And this also means the air becomes less dense higher up.</p>
<p>In 1648, Florin PÃ©rier had investigated whether air is less dense up on a mountain. For that he used the recently invented barometer (from around 1640). And he found that indeed air is less dense up on a mountain.</p>
<p>So, combining the knowledge that vacuums are possible and the knowledge that air is thinner higher up, von Guericke concluded in 1650 that there is most likely a vacuum between Earth and Moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There were astronomers that understood stars were other suns but had no understanding of the space between stars.  Are there records of their theories about this anyone can point to?  </p>
<p>Edit: the further I thought of this it dawned on me they had no reason to consider anything like weightlessness  either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Setting aside notions of discovering the atmosphere thins with increasing altitude, there are other observations astronomers made to support the fact that space is mostly vacuum.</p>
<p>The most important observation is that, if space contained a gas of any kind (air, oxygen, whatever), it would have an effect on the motions of any celestial body, exerting constant drag. When Newton described the motions of the planets solely in terms of gravitation and the three laws of motion, he posited that the planets were not being acted upon by any other force (because no other force was necessary to describe their motions, within the measurements of the time). This includes drag.</p>
<p>The planets' motions never slowed over time and simply continued in their orbits (the first law of motion), so we could assume nothing external acted upon them besides gravity. Therefore, the planets must be traveling through vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your respondents have covered your question on when mankind first made this discovery, I thought I'd elaborate on how we use this information today, because both &quot;no air&quot; and &quot;space&quot; are pretty fuzzy terms, and plotting out satellite movements doesn't work very well with fuzzy terms.</p>
<p>Physical measurements with weather balloons, sounding rockets, and even satellites have been used to tune density models that go so far as to include terms on the specific solar output of the sun for the last several days. (The atmosphere is not shaped like a sphere at high altitudes, it is shaped more like a pear. The sun heats up the atmosphere, expanding it, there is a lag to this affect, as it takes time to heat the atmosphere, so the atmosphere is densest at around 2-3 o'clock local time.) and even terms on the Earth's current electromagnetic field (protects from solar wind that noticeably flexes the Earth's atmosphere at high levels.</p>
<p><a href="http://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5050/projects/projects_2013/whitmire_ryder/index_files/image128.gif" target="_blank">Here is an image</a> that shows that daily expanding of the atmosphere after the sun heats it, as modeled by Jacchia 1970.</p>
<p>Even with all of that care to model such terms, and even with the most sophisticated usage of the model that includes local and recent weather corrections, density modelling (and hence the force of drag) is the most uncertain and inaccurate portion of everything that goes into predicting satellite movement (by an enormous margin). There are tons of different attempts to do it (Jacchia 1970, Jacchia-Roberts, Harris-Priester, MSIS 86, MSISE 90, and MSISE 2000 are the ones that I have used) and none of them are close to perfect.</p>
<p>When you see the news about a satellite that's unstable and is going to re-enter &quot;between 4 to 20 days from now&quot; or whatever enormous sounding error margin, that's all down to the fact that density is relatively inaccurate, and a re-entering satellite necessarily enters altitudes where that least accurate force model becomes the most important by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>All those &quot;slingshot assist 4 different planet and moons&quot; maneuvers can be planned so precisely because there being &quot;no air&quot; in &quot;space&quot; is a much, much less fuzzy statement for the parts of space those spacecraft are in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
