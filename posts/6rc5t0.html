<p>So if a basement, for example, has high Radon levels for, say 100 years, would that create a higher than normal concentration of lead in that enclosed environment?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about concentrations that would be nearly undetectable if the substances weren't radioactive. Let's run some numbers.</p>
<p>The highest recorded residential levels of radiation from radon and its decay products have been on the order of 100,000 becquerels of activity per cubic meter of air, where 1 Bq is defined as one atom decaying per second.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we'll pretend that each atom is removed from the sample as soon as it decays to lead-210, and radon is added as necessary to keep the activity at 100k Bq/m^3.</p>
<p>For one atom to go from radon-222 to lead-210 is a total of five decays: three alpha and two beta. Dividing our 100,000 decays per second by five decays per atom, we get 20,000 atoms of lead per cubic meter per second.</p>
<p>Now, applying that rate to a 50-m^3 room for 100 years (3.154 x 10^9 seconds), we get 3.154 x 10^15 atoms of lead, with a total mass of about a microgram.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess i can actually help you with this! I have pleasure of working on LNG tankers, we load and discharge refrigirated methane on a regular basis, however it is not pure 100% methane, there are traces of other gases loaded in the mix, and one of them is... Radon gas. So in line with your reasoning we should see a lot of lead 210 in our tanks. And do we? Yup, we actually have to test the tanks for lead 210 residue before entering cargo tanks, lead 210 tends to form a dusty layer on the surface of the cargo tanks and all of it comes from decayed Radon gas. I hope this helps! I can talk about this for hours...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SO, for starters, 4pCi/L is equal to 0.148 decay events per second per liter.</p>
<p>So that is 148 decays per second per cubic meter per second.</p>
<p>Now lets go with your question in the op and ask, ignoring the half lives of the intervening steps on the decay chain, how much lead is produced per cubic meter of volume in a basement with this activity level over the course of 100 years?</p>
<p>So, 148 decays per cubic meter per second, 148 decay/(m^3 x sec).</p>
<p>148 decay/(m^3 x sec) x 60 sec/min x 60 min/hr x 24 hr/day x 365 day/yr x 100yr = 4.667x10^11 lead atoms per cubic meter of basement volume.</p>
<p>4.667x10^11 lead atoms = 7.750x10^-13 moles of lead = 1.604x10^-10 grams of lead</p>
<p>So.  At 4pCi/L Radon activity for 100 years, you will be left with 0.1604 nanograms of lead per cubic meter.  Or 0.1241 parts per trillion airborne lead contamination.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm" target="_blank">CDC</a> 15 parts per billion is the max allowable in drinking water, so the basement air is around 10,000 times less contaminated that what is considered max safe to drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Likely not as there is more lead present from other sources.  On terms of meaningful quantities of things,  a block of lead contains on the order of a &quot;mol&quot; of atoms ~6 *10^23 this many radon atoms decaying over 10 years would produce so much radioactivity everyone in the house would be dead if they ever went down there.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am confused about radon. I know it is the densest gas, but is it possible for a gas to be so dense that an uncompressed bucket of it would be noticeably heavier than an empty one?</p>
<p>If you had a decent amount of radon all in one place, what would it look like? Would it be a sort of glowing cloud until it dissipated? Would it feel warm? Painful to stick your hand in it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
