		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, in Denmark - often (wrongly) heralded as a &quot;socialist&quot; counterpart to the USA - it is very, very easy to fire your employees. No reason is needed at all (absent bilateral contractual agreement which isn't the norm). </p>
<p>For very different reasons, perhaps: Benefits are high, so it's not a big economic issue to experience unemployment spells, especially for low income and/or unskilled union workers. While unemployed, unions and municipalities will provide relevant tax financed education and coaching apart from monetary benefits.</p>
<p>Business hire more freely as they won't get stuck with a surplus work force.</p>
<p>The biggest issue or difference here is that we don't have a working poor labour market, the lowest hourly wage is to high. This is not only a good thing - it is if you can get a &quot;normal&quot; job - but a minority, often with different issues like drug (ab)use or mental issues can't find a job at all as the easiest jobs with a low pay don't exist at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to other countries, it's partly because labor unions have for a very long time had a bad reputation in the U.S.  During the Cold War, they were portrayed as Communist sympathizers - consorting with the enemy.  Even in modern times, most public examples of unions are things like bad teachers who can't be fired because they're in a union or bad cops who commit crimes but can't be punished because they're in a union.  Even after the Cold War, the public narrative still portrays unions as evil.</p>
<p>As a result, relatively few people in the U.S. are (or have been) in a union, and that lack of collective bargaining has resulted in far fewer worker rights/protections/benefits than in other countries.  It's the same reason that we have fewer holidays and vacations, no maternity/paternity leave and limited sick time, and health care is still tied to employers (even though they don't want to deal with it either), etc.  </p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. has traditions of individualism and competitiveness.  If you're a good person, then you should be able to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, succeed, and outcompete everyone else no matter the obstacles.  And instead of thinking &quot;Hey, if they get those benefits, then it'll be more normal and so it'll be easier for me to get those benefits!&quot; you're supposed to think &quot;That's not fair!  I don't want them getting benefits that I don't get!  That would make it harder for me to outcompete them!&quot; and therefore you should block any social progress that doesn't directly affect you yet.  (Although that also means that everyone else is blocking any social progress that would affect you.)</p>
<p>In short, propaganda and divisiveness have been used to convince the population against it for generations.</p>
<p>TLDR: An average American has been convinced that such benefits as job protection would be misused by other (lesser) people at his/her expense, while he/she is better and will never need them, and therefore should vote against them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately it's just about competing philosophies, and that one philosophy is a little stronger in the USA than it is in some other countries.</p>
<p>The huge generalization is to say that certain things that are seen as a balancing act between two competing ideas elsewhere, are instead seen as one fundamental principle to some Americans.</p>
<p>For example: If you have a business, it's yours. You own it. What you do with it should be up to you. Who you hire for it should be up to you as well. If you want to hire only young women with large breasts, you should be able to. If you want to fire those women tomorrow, you also should be able to. Private ownership means no one else has a 'right' to tell you what to do with it. If they could tell you, then it wouldn't really be yours, but instead belong to some combination of you, the government, and the public.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the idealism to the practical, it is certainly true that barriers to starting and operating a business can stagnate growth and entrepreneurship. It's also true that market forces influence who people hire and fire. After all, if a company kept firing it's most productive workers, how long would you expect that company to last? Thus, the idea that the market promotes meritocracy. If you're a Libertarian, then you tend to believe that nothing does this better than the market does, and setting rules and restrictions only serves to screw it up.</p>
<p>So, the way to sum it up quickly is to say there's a lot of that notion going around in the USA. If instead you see capitalism as simply a tool of oppression, then you're on the opposite side of the argument. If you see capitalism as effective in many places, but imperfect, then you strive to balance out different interests as beneficially as possible, then you're somewhere in between. I can't tell you who is right, but the answer to your question is that Americans have a more economically right-wing blend of thinking than other places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If every job you can get is offering the same terms what can you do? Nothing. People just go along with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
