In the Earths core time runs a bit slower: <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/earth-s-core-is-2-5-years-younger-than-its-crust-thanks-to-the-curvature-of-space-time" target="_blank">https://www.sciencealert.com/earth-s-core-is-2-5-years-younger-than-its-crust-thanks-to-the-curvature-of-space-time</a>
The effect would be largest for neutron stars. For black holes &quot;age of the universe&quot; does not really apply inside the event horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The passage of time is relative between everything in the universe, and every other thing moving relative to anything else. As well as variances in gravity.</p>
<p>Consider a black hole that formed 10 billion years ago. There is matter, that from your perspective, is still falling into the black hole. From the perspective of the matter, only a few minutes may have passed as it falls inward. From your perspective the universe will suffer heat death before the matter passes the event horizon. The matter sees this happening in real time, in short order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is: more or less. It's not exactly the same, since time passes by for objects moving at different velocities and in different gravitational potentials, and the Universe isn't entirely uniform. Some regions are a little denser than average, and some are less dense. This is a pretty tiny effect, however: the differences in density from one region of the Universe to another are about one part in ten thousand, i.e., 10^(-5), and the age measured in these regions varies by a similarly tiny amount. Indeed, our best measurements of the age of the Universe have percent-level error, so that regional variation is still about a thousand times smaller than the <em>error</em> in our estimates of the Universe's age.</p>
<p>To put some numbers on all this, the age of the Universe is about 13.8 billion years, the error is in the ballpark of 100 million years, and the 10^(-5) variation between dense and underdense environments is in the realm of 100 thousand years. There are other reasons the age changes from place to place, such as other commenters have listed, but they generally lead to discrepancies far below even those relatively small numbers. One notable exception is near a black hole, where time slows down nearly to a halt as seen from outside, and time comes to an end entirely as seen from an object falling in when it hits the singularity. This is because black holes have extremely strong gravitational fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well technically yes
If your measuring age by how long it has been in existence, then technically everything in the universe, all matter, has existed forever, since before the big bang. Because remember, the big bang didn't create anything, everything was already there. It just expanded and spread out the incredibly dense matter into less density</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
