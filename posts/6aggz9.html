		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In pre-relativistic gravity, the gravitational field due to a single point mass is non-zero everywhere the field is defined. So the gravitational force on some test mess is never zero.</p>
<p>However, for an extended gravitating mass, there is <em>always</em> at least one point where the gravitational field is exactly <strong>0</strong>. Precisely, if ϱ(<strong>r</strong>) is some mass distribution with ϱ continuous and compactly supported (the latter means that ϱ = 0 for |<strong>r</strong>| &gt; <em>R</em> for some <em>R</em>), then there exists at least one point <strong>r**<em><em>0</em></em> where </strong>g<strong>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>0</em></em>) = </strong>0<strong>. For the case where ϱ is spherically symmetric, one such point is </strong>r<strong> = </strong>0** (e.g., the center of a spherically symmetric planet).</p>
<p>In general relativity, there is no such thing as the gravitational field and thus no such thing as the gravitational potential. There are only some inexact analogues (e.g., Christoffel symbols and metric tensor components, respectively). It's always possible in some frame to set up coordinates in such a way that a particular point the metric tensor components are the same as those of the flat Minkowski metric and the Christoffel symbols vanish at that point. So in that sense, the &quot;gravitational field&quot; is zero. This can even be done so that a free-falling observer always observes &quot;zero gravitational field&quot; along his worldline. This is just a locally inertial frame.</p>
<p>So what does that mean for the latter part of your question? Your argument goes something along the following lines. &quot;The gravitational force between two particles is never zero. So if the universe is infinite, how is it also expanding? If the universe is finite, how can it expand it forever?&quot; This reasoning erroneously mixes concepts from both pre-relativistic gravity and general relativity, so, of course, there is a contradiction. The two theories are already known not to be compatible anyway. The point is that there really is no good way to explain why the equations of GR give us an expanding universe.</p>
<p>If the universe is filled with some homogeneous matter field, then in pre-relativistic gravity, there is actually no solution to the Poisson equation. If you want to be very technical, I suppose the gravitational field would actually be <strong>0</strong> everywhere because if we assume the mass distribution is fixed, then any test mass will feel no force. Any force it feels in any particular direction is canceled by an equal force in the opposite direction. The problem with this reasoning is that the mass distribution is <em>not</em> fixed. Even in Newtonian gravity, the mass distribution will interact with itself. So the problem of a space filled homogeneously with matter is ill-defined in Newtonian gravity.</p>
<p>In GR, however, a homogeneous matter field <em>does</em> lead to a well-defined problem. The solution is the well-studied FLRW mertic. In fact, the prediction of metric expansion is very surprising since there is no analagous problem in Newtonian gravity, or, at best, the solution is very unstable. But, again, there's no reason to have expected the relativistic problem to have anything whatsoever to do with the ill-defined problem in Newtonian gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
