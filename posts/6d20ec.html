		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply, they are.</p>
<p>Marketing has many goals, but the general desire is to make the most number of people feel good about a product.</p>
<p>As such, they're aiming at the lowest common denominator and trying to make people correlate the feelings of sexiness or intelligence or sophistication from the commercial towards the product.</p>
<p>Let's take for example - Grey Poupon. Whole-grain mustard's difference from Yellow Mustard is that they use more than one seed, they grind coarsely, and they don't use Tumeric to make it bright yellow. </p>
<p>Dijon Mustard's difference from Yellow Mustard is again, no Tumeric, but adding in a bit of vinegar, white wine or other acidity (they used to use verjuice, but that's long gone). </p>
<p>Considering how expensive Tumeric can be and how cheap vinegars can be, it may actually be more expensive to produce yellow mustard than Dijon or Whole-Grain. It's usually not, but spice prices fluctuate.</p>
<p>But Grey Poupon is considered fancy - why? Good marketing....and really stupid people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many posts here about <em>other</em> stupid people but part of you is stupid too. The part of you that gets hungry or needs some comfort and wants pleasure.</p>
<p>That's the part of you these ads are targeting and they can be more influential than the smart part of you realizes. That smart part of you dismisses the ad then you watch it but later when you get hungry or or bored or lonely that dumb part of you starts salivating and that's when the real magic happens.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spend about $3000/month in online advertising for my own business and worked making tv commercials for others for 20 years. I have some experience making the exact ads you are referencing.</p>
<p>You are a reddit user which is notoriously difficult to advertise to. Techniques that work on the vast majority of the population won't work on you and some of those techniques aren't even allowed to be used when advertising on Reddit because of the severe backlash it creates.</p>
<p>The best advice I was given is to create ads for a six year old audience. They have to be very easy to understand with clear calls to action. If it's an online ad it needs a huge bright CLICK ME FOR DEAL button or else I'll start getting comments from people asking how to claim the offer or the conversion rate will just be .1%. The best part of online advertising (Facebook specifically) vs TV is Facebook learns who my customer is very quickly and will start going out sniping customers for me without spending a lot on impressions or needing to use targeted keywords. I also get instant feedback when someone buys something using the Facebook &quot;Pixel&quot;. So I know how much per conversion I am spending. With TV you can't really do that. I encourage anyone that wants to sell something worldwide or even local to just use Facebook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well &quot;sound/look like are made for really really stupid people&quot; is not quite accurate to say. But there are 2 reasons they may seem dumb on constant review.</p>
<p>1) Really good commercials are made to reach exactly who the business wants to reach. Their demo. </p>
<p>Often times you may see an obnoxious loud commercial for a children's cereal that is extremely stupid to you. But kids of a certain age want it and crave it. Some of those marketing campaigns stick with us for our entire lives. Bet you still have a Trix or Cocopuffs that you get nostalgic for. </p>
<p>2). Old school marketing wants to reach everyone even if everyone doesn't want their product. (This is usually far less effective but makes ad agencies lots of money for an easy production)</p>
<p>The commercials that strive to stretch their message to try and reach the largest group of people tend to be very simplistic. The commercial is also competing against people losing attention while they wait for the show to resume, distractions, anyone near a tv but not watching. So the simpler a message the more likely it will be communicated. If you can ensure that the commercial is understandable by anyone with a 5th grade reading level, can be understood in a busy bar, or even if the tv is on mute... then you reached the most people. They however may not be the people you want to reach.</p>
<p>Bonus: REALLY REALLY SMART marketers are scary </p>
<p>Why are they scary? They not only can pinpoint exactly the type of person they want to buy their product but can manipulate the viewer into doing so with emotion or attitude. They know getting its almost about making the customer feel good about their choice of your product. They associate what the customer wants to be or feel like with their product. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because smart people understand a smart premise, but stupid people don't. But both smart <em>and</em> stupid people understand a stupid premise. </p>
<p>Also, advertisements are often not the focus of our attention.  So they are more effective if people can understand it while not trying to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
