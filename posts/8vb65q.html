		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach destroys molecular bonds. Pigments (in order to function like a pigment) tend to be quite precise and complex combinations of atoms. Compare it to turning a car into nuts and bolts, except at the atomic level. This is also why bleach works on <em>most</em> stains, but not stuff like rust stains (as this is simply a combination of 2 or 5 iron/oxygen molecules depending on the state of iron)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good pigment is a compound that absorbs a fairly narrow band of light in the visible spectrum.  If the compound absorbs too wide of a band, it will generally be more or a muddy-brown or black, and if it's not absorbing in the visible spectrum obviously we won't appreciate its color.  For a given wavelength of light, there is a corresponding amount of energy that will be carried by each photon at that wavelength.  Considering the physics and chemistry of the compound, in order to absorb the light with that energy, it needs to be the case that there is an electron which, if it absorbed said photon would be able to jump from its previous energy level to another available energy level which is higher by precisely the energy carried by the photon; that is, the gap between the previous energy level and the ending energy level must equal the energy absorbed by the photon.  Now, for most of the electrons in chemical bonds, the gaps between energy levels are so high that the corresponding light would be somewhere in the Ultraviolet of even higher energy range, thus not visible light, thus not appropriate to be a pigment.</p>
<p>Two big categories of compounds that make good pigments are 1) mineral compounds in which a crystal structure is formed of anions and cations; typically with the orbitals of the electrons in one ion (typically the cation) having a different geometry (say, octahedral) from that of the corresponding counter ion arranged around it (say, tetrahedral).  The result is that some of the orbitals have an energy which is slightly higher or lower than the others by a small amount of energy, an amount of energy that will correspond with something in the visible light range.  This explains why, for example, various iron containing compounds such as rust are red, and why various copper containing compounds are blue.  These types of pigments are generally not susceptible to bleach or, for that matter, to photobleaching.</p>
<p>Another option for the underlying chemistry and physics of a pigment is 2) to have a system of conjugated pi bonds, whereby for example you have a chain of carbon atoms with (to simplify things a bit) alternating single and double bonds.  The electrons actually get delocalized over the entire chain, and, as a result, have a lot of closely spaced energy shells that they can end up in.  It is often the case that this means they can absorb specific photons in the visible light and thus potentially make a good pigment.  These types of pigments are generally susceptible to bleach and photobleaching.</p>
<p>When you have a conjugated system of pi bonds on a carbon chain, it is possible to for it to undergo a hydration reaction, whereby one of the carbon-carbon double bonds breaks, leaving behind a carbon-carbon single bond, with one of the carbons forming a new bond with the hydroxyl group (-OH) from a water molecule, and the other forming a bond with the other hydrogen (-H).  This is more likely to happen in a strongly oxidizing environment, such as when exposed to bleach, which is a strong oxidant.  This is also more likely to happen when some of the electrons are in a highly excited state, as when exposed to ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>The pigments which work by having conjugated systems of pi bonds tend to be organic pigments.  The blue in blueberries, the yellow in turmeric, the indigo in indigo, all of these have strong colors that can be adsorbed fairly well into cloth, but all of them are susceptible to bleach and photobleaching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
