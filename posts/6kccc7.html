		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm very tired so I'll give a short winded shitty response but you'll probably get the gist of it. </p>
<p>Glow in the dark objects contain a compound (phosphors) that can be excited by light. The compound absorbs the light energy by using it to put its electrons in a higher energy shell. If you imagine the Bohr atomic model with the rings around the center, the electron would be moving away from the center therefore occupying a high energy state. The atoms in the compound then release the energy via moving the electron back to its lower energy state (closer to the middle of the atom) and this energy release is given off as light. What color the light is when it's released depends on what compound is used, and what wavelength/energy value is absorbed/emitted by that compound. So to answer your second half of the question- no, not all glow in the dark objects use the same compound. </p>
<p>There's more to it and I'm sure someone will take the time to explain it but that's the simple version </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glowsticks operate via chemiluminescence, which is a fancy way to refer to a chemical reaction that produces light. You know that a chemical reaction is occurring because you need to mix the two chemicals in the glow stick to activate it. Phosphorescence, on the other hand, is the mechanism for glow-in-the-dark pigments that need to be &quot;charged&quot; by exposure to external light. Phosphorescent chemicals absorb light and then re-emit it slowly, at a lower intensity after a relatively long period of time. Radioluminescence involves using a radioactive element to excite a chemical that then emits the energy as visible light. This used to be highly popular, but that was at a time when radioactive water was marketed as a health tonic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms absorb and reflect light. Leaves on a tree absorb light and only reflects green light.</p>
<p>Glow in the dark objects are the same. They need to absorb light before they can glow, thats why after a while they become very dim if they haven't been under the light for a few hours.</p>
<p>The reason why they glow in the dark unlike other objects is called phosphorescence. The object absorbs light but they don't reflect it instantly. The energy of the light thats absorbed is slowly released over time. </p>
<p>What happens inside the atom: In normal objects the electron of the atom absorbs the photon of light. This gives the electron energy, the electron is what we call excited. The electron then releases that energy again in the form of light which we see. </p>
<p>Objects that are phosphorescent have electrons that absorb light, but releases it in small steps over a long period of time. </p>
<p>Hope this was easy to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
