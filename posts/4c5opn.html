		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you can see from the other comments, there are different effects at work here. But if the spaceship moves away from you, it will space out. I'll try to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Relativistic time dilation</strong>: From your point of view, the time inside the spacecraft moves slower. This means, it might take several seconds from the point of view of your reference frame until one second has passed in the spaceship.<br />
Let's make this precise: If β=v/c is the speed of the spacecraft in units of c, then there are γ=1/sqrt(1-β^(2)) seconds between two signal emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Classical Doppler Effect</strong>: Because the spacecraft moves away from you, each signal has to travel a larger distance than the previous one.<br />
In the γ seconds between two emissions, the spacecraft has moved γ*v*(1s). This means, every emission needs γ*v*(1s)/c = γ*β seconds more to reach you than the previous one.<br />
Adding those two effects, we see that you will get a signal every γ*(1+β) seconds. (This is called the formula of the <em>relativistic Doppler effect</em>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expansion of Space</strong>: This effect is tiny, but let's include it for fun. Because space itself is expanding, the two emissions will arrive a little more spaced out than when they were sent out.<br />
The speed with which the signals move apart can be calculated as H*d, where H is the Hubble constant and d is the distance of the signals. This distance is initially d=γ*(v+c)*(1s) because of the contributions of the movement of the ship and of the first signal. We will approximate this distance and therefore the speed as constant, and get that there are additional H*γ*(β+1)*(r/c) seconds between two signals, where r is the distance of the spaceship from you.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Gravitational time dilation</strong>: Because of the Earth's gravitational field, when one second passes in space, only (1 - 6.953*10^(-10)) seconds pass on Earth (see e.g. <a href="http://www.awitness.org/unifiedm/introgrtd.html" target="_blank">here</a>). This effect actually counteracts the other effects. By the way: Considering this is crucial for GPS, as others here have mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, we take a spaceship at half the speed of light (β=0.5, γ=1.155) which is one parsec away (r=3.26 lightyears). Because of the relativistic doppler effect, the signals will arrive every 1.732 seconds. The expansion of space adds only 4.16*10^(-10) seconds between two signals, which is an even smaller effect than the gravitational time dilation. (At extremely large r, this effect might become relevant though.)</p>
<p>^(<em>Edit</em>: Small additions)<br />
^(<em>Edit 2</em>: Fixed a mistake in the expansion of space part)<br />
^(<em>Edit 3</em>: Getting too late to reply to all follow-up questions. Thanks for my first gold though!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>See GPS satellite. <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html" target="_blank">Because an observer on the ground sees the satellites in motion relative to them, Special Relativity predicts that we should see their clocks ticking more slowly (see the Special Relativity lecture). Special Relativity predicts that the on-board atomic clocks on the satellites should fall behind clocks on the ground by about 7 microseconds per day because of the slower ticking rate due to the time dilation effect of their relative motion.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the orientation of the craft's velocity vector with respect to Earth. The plain old non-relativistic Doppler effect will (often) win out over relativistic time dilation, so if the craft is moving towards us, we will get the signals at a faster-than-one-second rate. If the craft is moving away from us, we will get them at a slower-than-one-second rate. If it's moving perpendicular to the Earth, then the only effect will be relativistic time dilation, and we will get the signals at a slower-than-one-second rate.</p>
<p><del>I know that at speeds on the slower side of relativistic, the Doppler effect will win out over relativistic time dilation. I'm not sure, however, if there is a speed at which the craft can move towards the observer and have the observer receive the signals slower than a second. I suspect the answer is no.</del>
The Doppler effect will always win out over time dilation, as is apparent in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect" target="_blank">relativistic doppler equation</a>, which takes both effects into account. Thanks to /u/WanShi_Tong for pointing that out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another wrinkle is this: assume the ship is traveling perpendicular to Earth, so there is no Doppler effect, only special relativity.</p>
<p>Yes, we would read the ship's beacon as running slow. But if we were broadcasting a beacon from Earth, the ship would read <em>our</em> beacon as running slow, too.</p>
<p>(General relativity doesn't work this way: in a gravity well, the stuff happening in space looks fast, and from space, the stuff in a gravity well looks slow.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
