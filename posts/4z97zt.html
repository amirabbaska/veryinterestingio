		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse and have taken a number of courses on wound dressing and healing. Here's what I can quickly write out for you. </p>
<p>The goal of wound care is <em>moist</em> wound healing. If wounds are draining plenty of blood/pus/serous drainage and it isn't being removed from the wound by an absorbent dressing, the tissue can become macerated and will appear white. It's too wet, the tissue is swollen with water. This is bad for wound healing. This is maybe where people got the idea of letting a wound &quot;breathe&quot; to dry up some of the excess moisture. </p>
<p>However, letting it dry out completely is not ideal either.</p>
<p>Natural healing involves developing a scab, a dry cover for the wound. However, if the wound were instead moist (not wet), you would have faster migration of immune cells, new cells, growth factors, etc. as they can move through a moist environment easier.  This is what topicals like polysporin (besides the Abx) help to achieve. Petroleum products will moisturize without macerating. </p>
<p>And the other question everyone asks: should I use peroxide to clean it? no. maybe. Here's the thing. You can clean a wound very well with water or saline (although who has saline at home). Many wounds wash themselves out by bleeding! Peroxide will kill bacteria, but it also hurts exposed skin cells/other tissue, and that can slow healing. The surface of your skin is mostly keratin and peroxide won't affect intact skin, but when it's cut, the deeper layers can be affected. Basically, don't peroxide every wound, but something like a cat bite, go for it. </p>
<p>*edit: I'm aware now of how many people have saline. I pour like half a litre over new wounds, so I'm not sure people have that much contact solution. I have 25/20 vision privilege so am unaware. Yes, you should see a doctor quickly for cat bites. I've seen people need strong antibiotics 4x a day to avoid death from cat bites. Go to ER NOW if your wound starts streaking red up your limb. Helpful to outline areas of redness with a pen and the time you marked it to show how it's progressing. Also, I seriously can't answer all your questions, RIP my inbox. I'm reading them though! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General surgeon here, we and plastics deal with big nasty sounds so just wanted to say most these are correct, for small wounds confined to the dermis (not into the fat) AND if you are healthy (not on the toe of a patient who has bad vascular disease) then you literally can almost do anything and it will heal.  And for the most part the other answers here are accurate.  Keep it clean, keeping it covered with a dry dressing is more so you don't get fluid all over your clothes. We don't spend much time in the acute surgery world talking about that stuff because it's sort of trivial and you can't really go wrong IN GENERAL.</p>
<p>Once you get deeper, exposed fat and beyond (note that I've seen wounds with exposed spinal dura and spinal column hardware left open) then you have to keep it moist and an antibiotic ointment is used, with the standard being silvadene or bacitracin.  If the tissue dries out the superficial tissue will die and becomes bacteria food.  They can at a later point often be closed, or can be allowed to heal on their own with or without the assistance of a vacuum called a wound vac.  This is called secondary intention (primary is closure with suture or staples or whatever). Of note complex wound care can be very difficult to take care of, and this is just an idea of what goes into it.  </p>
<p>In terms of minimizing scar, there are some
Vitamin ointments and lotions that claim to
Help with questionable benefit.  Some say that it's just the mechanical running of the scar that causes it to remodel and become less obvious. </p>
<p>My rule for superficial wounds is keep it clean, keep
Dry bandage over it, and once it's scabbed you can put a bandage over it as needed.   Getting it wet in the shower is almost universally, pat dry and cover with bandage.  But obviously follow your providers advice for any specific wound as again, I'm speaking in generalities.  Typed on phone so sorry if typos </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've only seen the top several replies, and it seems people are picking sides as if the is one bandage to rule them all (heh). [Edit: and it seems that I was mistaken or people edited in, I honestly don't recall, but leaving it as is because &quot;seems&quot; works there.]</p>
<p>Look at it as pros and cons.</p>
<p>Moist(covered) heals faster.  Debris has a barrier so it can be easier to ward off infection from outside.</p>
<p>Dry(scabbed over) is sometimes just plainly more convenient or even durable. </p>
<p>That is the short of it, I'll list some comparative statements below where the pro-con should be obvious given context, but I'll dwell on some of the positives of letting it have air just because there are so many seemingly totally against it having listed quite a bit.</p>
<p>A scab can act like stitches and allow a bit of use and is mostly a liquid tight barrier, at least in the short term.  Dust and dirt won't stick to a scab it as opposed to say, if your bandage has fallen off and you can't replace it immediately.  You can get it wet to, say, wash your hands, take a shower.  You can chop up peppers for gumbo or chili without the bandage soaking up hot pepper juices and allowing said juices access to a nice soft and moist skin area.  Moist skin all around the wound can be problematic-itchy or become soft or even prune up and make things hella more sensitive because it's all squishy and mobile, being dry allows most of the skin to act as it would if there were no wound, be a protective barrier with a bit of toughness. The wound is visible, so inflammation and infection can be easier to detect.</p>
<p>A scab can also catch on a string, like say a hand in and out of a pocket and rip off entirely or just pull the wound open.  A bandage can keep you mindful of the wound so such things don't happen, or if it does, a bandage, if properly tended, can be easily replaced, unlike a naturally grown scab.  A bandage can look a lot less disgusting(though it can also look a lot more gross).</p>
<p>A lot of choice will come down to not only the above daily living stuff, but heavily on what sort of wound it is.  If it's gaping and oozing clear stuff, it can sometimes be good to let that drain, and other times let it dry and scab and nature take it's course.</p>
<p>Optimally, something like a somewhat minor cut on the pad of your thumb, I'd say super glue it shut.  Don't shoot it down in there, but there's a lot of mostly dead skin on the outside to anchor to for most people as there's going to be <em>some</em> amount of thickened skin on the working surface, if not outright callous...but some people's mileage may vary on this one.  This acts like a super scab and can get you almost instantly back to work with a minimum of fuss or muss.  The speed differential at which it heals isn't really a large factor for a lot of such wounds.</p>
<p>Now, a deep gash across your palm?  That probably would be best with a bandage.  High flex area, you may even be wise to bandage the whole hand closed in a loose fist after a proper cleaning of course.  </p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>It is an as-needed basis to trim down-time.  Does it really need swaddled in bandages, or can you do something less and get back to life?</p>
<p>Had wide variety of cuts and wounds to hands and a few elsewhere.  There really is no overall &quot;best&quot; scenario.  There are always some mitigating factors that will help you along till it heals, or alternatively, something that <em>must</em> be done to avoid further damage/infection, the time differential of healing with either way is usually the least important factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>google &quot;hydrocolloid dressing&quot;.  popular brands are duoderm and johnson &amp; johnson's tough pads.</p>
<p>As a cyclist I've had my fair share of road rash, and this stuff is <em>amazing</em> - basically an entirely adhesive pad that you cover the road rash with.  yeah, adhesive even over the wound.  the fluids that drain from the wound cause a couple of things to happen: 1) adhesive stops sticking there, and 2) the bandage swells up adding padding to the spot where the wound is.  You slap it on after initially cleaning/drying, and leave it on .. as long as you can.  I've worn them for ~a week and taken them off to reveal pink, unbroken skin.</p>
<p>breathable, can wear it in the shower, keeps the wound moist, healing time substantially reduced, comfortable.. I can't think of anything negative about them.  Their price maybe for some folks, but I'd pay a lot more for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
