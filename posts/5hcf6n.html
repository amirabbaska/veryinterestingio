		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The slowness is less about the computer itself and more about the software... mostly. Unless you let your computer get jammed up with dust or the fan is damaged, computers don't really get &quot;slower&quot;. For example, well maintained gaming consoles (which are computers that just are specialized for video games), from the Gamecube to the Atari 2600, will play their original games as today as well as they did the first day they came out of the factory.</p>
<p>If you don't properly maintain your computer, things can get damaged, either limiting performance as the computer automatically uses less power to keep itself cool, or problems with parts of the hardware can cause all kinds of weird glitches.</p>
<p>However, the reason most computers start to feel slow is because of the <em>software</em>. When Microsoft updates word, when Youtube adds features, when entirely new software hits the market, they are expecting their average user to have more and more powerful machines. They stop optimizing performance for older CPU's/GPU's, start expecting their customers to have greater and greater amount of RAM and faster Harddrives. </p>
<p>Your computer isn't running slower, it's just being asked to run more and more calculations than it used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the computer that gets slow, it's the operating system.</p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>You have a huge warehouse, with neat shelves, properly organized. It's quick and easy to find stuff.</p>
<p>Well, after ten years, you have put thinks on the wrong shelves, put things in there which didn't even have a defined space in the shelves, moved things around, broken partas are mixed with good parts and thinks are generally getting messy. Now, finding the right part takes more time.</p>
<p>It's a bit like that. Windows tends to get messy after a while. This is not a problem with most other OSes, though, such as the Linux/Unix variants, which are designed to enforce order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers here and some actually point to it but don't explicitly say this: Sometimes its <strong>the user</strong>.</p>
<p>The user downloads crap (bloatware, malware) on their computer, fails to keep the storage clean and tidy (clean up, defrag for HDD), allows a ridiculous amount of dust to gather inside case, fans etc. </p>
<p>Yes there are many instances of poor optimization, bad software design etc but many other times it is the person using the computer who is making mistakes, and unfortunately often they refuse to accept it's them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most cases what is actually happening is you have programs running in the background that are using your computers resources unnecessarily.  Most users accumulate more and more programs over time, naturally, but don't realize many of them continue running because they are hiding in the background somewhere.  </p>
<p>Probably the second biggest factor is patience.  I believe our impatience is growing at a faster rate than the actual decrease in old computer's performance.  In other words, it isn't getting THAT much slower, we just think it is because our patience is constantly decreasing as new technologies increase our expectations.  </p>
<p>The other factor are bugs or technical limitations.  I won't get into the technical details but there are technical issues that can cause slowdown over time, particularly if you are not technical enough to recognize a problem and fix it.    </p>
<p>To give you an example of how small problems add up to serious issues:. Let's say that for every thousand lines of code, there's one line that causes your PC to get a fraction of a second slower.  You don't notice the difference, but it's there, and maybe it gets fixed, or maybe the software maker went out of business, or maybe you, the user, failed to download the fix, or maybe the fix cause new problems anyway.  Point is, you have billions of lines of code on your system, with potentially thousands of little hiccups like this that eventually add up to noticeable slowdown.  These problems can even come from stuff you've deleted or uninstalled, because so many programs are hooked together in complicated ways that sometimes the uninstallation fails to find and remove these hiccups.   </p>
<p>As you install, modify, and uninstall more stuff, more bugs accumulate.  A brand new computer is based on basically ONE set of programs that can be thoroughly tested for stability, but nobody can test BILLIONS of different combinations of software that every different user has, to look for programs that clash to create bugs.  Newer operating systems have gotten better about preventing this, and it's increasingly moot because the hardware can just brute force through the problems sometimes so you don't even notice, but it still happens.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple things at work here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Software manages where it stores data. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a programmer forgets to remove data they no longer need. </p>
<p>The computer through a trickle of these mistakes from many programs starts to run out of space to store things.</p>
<p>As a result it uses a slower storage mechanism (your hard drive) to save the stuff it had stored for another program, and keeps swapping the memory one program needs for another.</p>
<p>This also can happen in the program that runs your operating system.</p>
<p>This usually can be remedied by buying more storage (RAM), or by restarting your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Software is getting slower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software is getting more and more separated from hardware.</p>
<p>The benefit is that software can be run on different hardware with little modification.</p>
<p>The down side is it uses more resources.</p>
<p>Also as computers have gotten faster, programmers have gotten lazier.</p>
<p>They are increasingly using languages that manage memory for them, and are slower and abstract many details from them.</p>
<p>Also they tend to develop on faster and faster hardware, so they do not experience this slowdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planned Obsolescence </li>
</ul>
<p>Some people who make hardware have an incentive for it to slow down over time, so you will purchase new hardware.</p>
<p>They will release newer versions of their operating system that runs slower on your hardware, and not spend a lot of time optimizing it because they want you to buy their new hardware.</p>
<p>Part of this is they want to showcase the speed and capabilities of their newer hardware and don't very much care for maintaining and supporting their older hardware. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
