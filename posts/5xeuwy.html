		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, bleach is a mixture of 1 to 25% of NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) and water. Now, let's look at the formula: you can see we have sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl) and oxygen.</p>
<p>In reactions, NaClO is highly likely to oxydize things, which means that it is prone to give his oxygen to something else. </p>
<p>Now, colours are given by a wide category of compounds, the chromophores (from latin: bringers of colours). Bleach oxydizes these compounds (it gives them tha oxygen), which changes their behaviour and change their properties, destroying colour basically.</p>
<p>Now, there are 3 possible explanations to your couch colour:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The green compund turns yellow when oxydized. Instead of going from &quot;reflect only green AKA look green&quot; to &quot;reflect everything AKA look white&quot;, this compund goes to &quot;reflect only yellow&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green can be made by yellow + blue. The blue compound reacts with bleach and goes white, the yellow doesn't. You now have a pale shade of yellow.</p>
</li>
<li>You haven't used enough bleach.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, oxydation is what destroys colours. Some stains can be removed with oxygenated water (H2O2), which has lot of oxygen and so oxygenates things well (most notably, fresh blood stains which are otherwise har to remove). </p>
<p>Colours of old things are faded because exposure to the oxygen in the air.</p>
<p>Sun makes colours fade (think about clothes you use a lot in the sun or your own hair during summer, unless you have black or platinum blonde hair) because it heats things, speeding up the reaction with oxygen in the air and there are several more examples like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a really intense base. It oxidizes the materials it comes in contact with. Chromophores are the parts of molecules that reflect light and give color to those molecules. When bleach is introduced to material, the oxidation process alters the chromophores in such a way that they no longer reflect only the light that gives color to the material. This is how bleach essentially strips away color. However, different materials, colors, and amounts of bleach can affect the oxidation process enough to produce a range of shades from white to yellow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is an oxidizer that breaks up molecules.  The new molecules are different substances that just happen to reflect light differently or not at all.  Sunlight bleaching is the same process only slower and using ultraviolet light instead of chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you bleach fabric, it reacts with the things in fabric that make it colorful. Sometimes this means your fabric comes out white. Depending on how much bleach you use, and what was used to make the fabric colorful, it may come out yellow, or even a light green.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
