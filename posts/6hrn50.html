		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Super short answer:</strong> Sheer numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Krill are very small, but tend to form <em>huge</em> swarms, so to a whale they're like giant clouds of food. It's similar to how rice grains are very small but you can get full from eating a heaping bowl of rice.</p>
<p><strong>Full Answer:</strong> The main difference between plants and animals is that usually plants just need sunlight and water while animals have to eat.</p>
<p>Some animals eat plants, some animals eat other animals. In order for an animal to survive there must be enough food for it to eat.</p>
<p>In many places it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plants grow from water and sunlight</li>
<li>Animals eat the plants</li>
<li>Other animals eat those animals</li>
<li>Other animals eat <em>those</em> animals</li>
<li>And on and on and on...</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two important things to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All</strong> of the food originally comes from plants.</li>
<li>Not all food that's eaten gets turned into new food that another animal could eat.</li>
</ol>
<p>When an animal eats it uses food to grow, which means it creates more food if another animal eats it. But not all of the food an animal eats becomes growth. Some food gets used up when the animal runs around, and some just becomes poop.</p>
<p>For every 10 ounces of food an animal eats, it only produces 1 ounce of food for another animal to eat. This means a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to be a big animal you have to eat a <em>lot</em> of food.</li>
<li>There is a <em>lot</em> more food if you eat plants than if you eat animals.</li>
<li>There is a <em>lot</em> more food if you eat an animal that eats plants than if you eat an animal that eats other animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Krill eat plants, specifically algae, and algae grows <em>incredibly fast</em>, which means krill have <em>huge</em> amounts of food to eat when algae is growing. The krill grow very fast, and have lots of babies because they're completely surrounded by food and can eat as much as they want all day long and never go hungry.</p>
<p>This turns into a giant swarm of food that other animals could easily eat, and whales can get absolutely gigantic because all they have to do is swim through the swarm with their mouths open and they get an easy mouthful of food.</p>
<p>Easy food for krill means giant swarms which means easy food for whales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No good answer.. so i googled up that shit.</p>
<p>Tldw:
Whales eat only during 4 months a year. Krill multiplicate in those months. There are lots of krill. Whales accumulate so much fat that they survive the &quot;winter&quot;</p>
<p>During the antartic summer the water gets warmer and the currents pull up plancton from ghe bottom. Thus is the core meal of the sea. Krill will feed on the plancton and in the arctic summer krill will proliferate and multiply. Now these little fuckers are like 2 inches long. Yet during the summer the total mass of all krill will surpass the mass of all humans on earth. Krill are the feast of the seas because they travel in tight packs. Since there are billions of them you have a tight patch of krill that spans for literal miles.</p>
<p>Makes easy to hunt and eat... just drive thru and open wide.</p>
<p>Now (not only)the whales will travel to the krill area in the summer and use some tricks to trap krill and will eat about 2 ton of krill every day building up fat.</p>
<p>This spectacle repeats every year. The ciecle of life</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well they eat a lot of them.</p>
<p>You've eaten rice, haven't you? A single grain of rice isn't going to fill you up or give you a lot of nutrition, but you don't eat just one grain of rice, you eat a bunch of them. Similarly, whales eat a (figurative) ton of krill to maintain their nutritional requirements.</p>
<p>Edit: Might be a literal ton too. I'm unwilling to do the math on the subject at 1:47 am.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a Bioligist, but I did just return from a National Geographic trip and this is what I learned from the naturalists. </p>
<p>Let's look at the humpback whale. The humpback whale has baleen on only its upper jaw that it uses to filter out the massive amounts of sea water it can take while swimming up to the surface (Up to 15,000 gallons, or about the size of a swimming pool <a href="https://postimg.org/image/8udbjkptb/" target="_blank">1</a> ). Baleen are made up of the same material as our fingernails, keratin, and there are numerous long strips of them that can be taller than a grown man.

(<a href="http://alaskatrekker.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bubblenet_feeding1.jpg" target="_blank">http://alaskatrekker.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bubblenet_feeding1.jpg</a>)
As you can see in this diagram, the part under the whale's bottom jaw is able to expand due to its accordion like skin. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/84/63/65/8463654cda8c3436a997506fdae84528.jpg" target="_blank">3</a>
The whale then filters out this massive amount of water by using its tongue to push out the sea water through its baleen which is located on its upper jaw. The krill and other small sea creatures are trapped in the baleen while the sea water is able to exit the mouth with ease. While krill is a part of their diet, it is not their only source of food. We saw the humpbacks also target herrings as another option. Rinse and repeat and this is how these whales are able to sustain themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Krill do not swim around on their own, they appear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cSUGhZmycM" target="_blank">MASSIVE swarms</a>. A whale just has to swim through that with the mouth wide open to swallow literally (literally literally) tons of that stuff a day. So the answer to your question is - they simply eat a lot of krill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
