		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to measure the distance to an object in space. For the closest stars you can use something called parallax.<br />
If you put your arm out in front of you and hold one finger up and look at it with one eye and then the other it will look like the finger is at different places! Now try moving the finger to different distances from your eyes and the &quot;jump&quot; in distance will be larger the closer the finger is to your eyes.<br />
This is because our eyes are separated by a small distance and if we know this seperation and the apparent difference in distance of the finger when looking with the different eyes we can work out the distance between the eyes and the finger.<br />
Now if you look at a star and blink your eyes like this you won't see any difference.. But if you look at a star today and then wait half a year the Earth has moved to the other side of the Sun and this effect will be measurable! And since we know the distance to the Sun we can work out the distance to the star we are observing.</p>
<p>Now if the object we are observing is to far away for this effect to be noticable we must use a different technique, and there's quite a few! The most common techniques include so called standard candles and red shift. A standard candle is something that always shines at the same intensity, that gives of the same amount of light no matter what. The most famous example of a standard candle are a special type of supernovae (SNe), namely type Ia SNe.<br />
These SNe occur when a white dwarf leeches material from a companion star. When the white dwarf has leeched enough material to reach a certain threshold, known as the Chandrasekhar limit, the white dwarf will explode and this explosion is very well understood and we know how much light it give out as they all occur under the same circumstances. By measuring the intensity of these SNe we can figure out the distance to the SNe since light intensity decreases with distance.<br />
Another standard candle are Cepheid variable stars. These stars vary in intensity and the period of their variation is tightly associated with its luminosity and be looking at how much of the light reaches us we can calculate the distance.<br />
As for red shift, that is for the very large scales! As an object moves through space the light it sends out gets shifted, just like a sound wave does which you can hear as an ambulance drives past you. As it approaches you hear a higher pitch and after it has passed you hear a lower pitch. The same thing happens with light waves. Because of the expansion of the Universe this means that objects separated by some distance will also be moving apart at a speed correlated to the distance, so by looking at how much the light has shifted we can see how fast the objects are moving compared to each other and at large scales this movement will be dominated by the expansion. (The light also gets stretched further from the expansion in another way but that's not necessary to think about here.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For determining the distance of a star, one method is to assume it doesn't move (much) relative to the earth over one year. Then, because the earth moves around the sun, the star will <em>appear</em> to shift a few degrees in the sky during half a year. We know the distance of the earth to the sun, so we know how far the earth has moved relative to where it was. Now when we measure the angle that the star has 'shifted' by, it's simple trigonometry to determine the (approximate) distance of the star. This method is also similar to how we all figure out how far away something is; except, we don't look at the position of an object at two different times, but compare between our two eyes.</p>
<p>Now, if we have some idea about the distance of the star, we can measure how much light we receive from it. From this, using the fact that intensity obeys an inverse square law (i.e., intensity decreases by the square of the distance), we can calculate how bright the star is. We can also look at the spectrum and color of the star, and use some fancy equations and characterizations to draw conclusions about the mass of the star. </p>
<p>I'm sure actual astronomers use many more techniques, but these are some basic things you can do.</p>
<p>As for exoplanets, things are generally more difficult (which is why it took so long to discover any, and even longer to find a lot of them). As I understand it, there's a few things you can look at. One thing you can do is measure a stars brightness over time. If there's a small dip in it, it might be because it's been obscured by something in front of it, and this might have been a planet. The problem here is that planets generally are quite small compared to their star, so this dip in brightness will be really small. There's also the fact that there's more things that can cause the brightness of a star to vary, so you need to rule out all other possibilities. Add to this the simple fact that if the planet doesn't orbit in the right plane, it won't pass between us and the star, and you can see why this is not a very effective way of finding exoplanets. There are other methods in use, but I can't comment on those. </p>
<p>Hope I didn't make any mistake, if I did I will try to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The spectra of a star is primarily a black body spectrum, by analyzing the spectrum of the light emitted by a star we can determine its temperature and luminosity. From that we can determine what type of star it is and get a pretty good (though not precise) estimate of the star's mass and size based on our understanding of stellar evolution (from other stars we've studied).</p>
<p>For planets detected with the transit technique we'll know how <em>much</em> the light dimmed when the planet passed in front of the star, which will tell us the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the planet to the star, revealing the planet's size. From that we can use some guessing to categorize the type of planet (rocky, gaseous) and estimate the mass that way.</p>
<p>Direct measurements of mass currently more or less require use of a different technique, one used to detect other exoplanets, called radial velocity. By very closely examining the spectral &quot;finger prints&quot; (absorption and emissions lines from gases in the star's atmosphere) we can measure the line of sight speed of the star relative to Earth very precisely (to a precision of less than 1 m/s). By looking for characteristic periodic changes in that velocity we can spot the star getting tugged back and forth by a planet orbiting it. From that we can determine the force of gravitational pull on the star by the planet which tells us something about its mass directly. However, the tilt of the orbit relative to our line of sight affects how much of the planet's pull we see, so we don't get the pure mass we get the &quot;Msin(i)&quot; mass. In the case of planets that are observable using both techniques we know what the orbital inclination is (due to the transit we know that it's basically laying flat relative to our line of sight) we know the mass measured is the actual mass.</p>
<p>Additionally, by measuring the distance and period of the planet orbit we can determine the mass of the parent star because the relationship between those two is related to the mass of the star.</p>
<p>As for the distance to a star we use two techniques. One is to measure it directly through parallax, but this (traditionally) only works for some of the closer stars in our galaxy. The other is to again measure the star's temperature and other characteristics and from that figure out what type of star it looks like, then from measuring the observed brightness of the star using the estimated absolute brightness (based on the star's &quot;identity&quot;) to estimate its distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distance has been covered pretty well, but there are a few ways we can work out the size (mass, or radius).</p>
<p>There's the radial velocity (or 'Doppler wobble') method. We know that stars and planets both orbit one point, which, if the star is large, will be inside the star. We can observe this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Orbit3.gif" target="_blank">wobble</a> by looking at the redshift of the star. The star's spectrum is redshifted when it's moving away from us, and blueshifted when it's moving towards. From this, we work out the period of the star's orbit. Using this and the mass of the star (which we know from its spectral type) we can use Kepler's laws to estimate the minimum mass of the star. It's the minimum mass because we can only calculate M*sin(i), not M directly, unless we know i, the inclination of the planet's orbit.</p>
<p>This doesn't tell us the radius of the planet, though. We'd need to use other methods for that. On top of that, we need to see the whole orbit, so we're missing a lot of planets. Saturn, for example, hasn't gone through one whole orbit since we started using this method, and therefore would be undetected.</p>
<p>It also tends to favour bigger planets close to the Sun ('Hot Jupiters'). Smaller planets further away, like Earth, are harder to detect.</p>
<p>If the planet transits the star (that is, moves in front of it, relative to us) we can work out its radius from the relative drop in brightness of the star. The problem is that the probability of a planet transiting a star is quite low (less than 1%), so we make up for it by looking at a lot of stars.</p>
<p>This won't tell you the mass of the planet, though. But we can use the radial velocity method on top of that.</p>
<p>Most exoplanets have been detected by the transit method. Quite a few were detected by radial velocity in the early days, but not so much now. And a few have been detected by weirder methods, with names  like 'gravitational microlensing'.</p>
<p>We can also directly image exoplanets - we point a telescope at the star and go 'look, there's one'. The images will be infrared, not visible light, though. And it's very hard to see any planets this way, because they're so dim compared to the star - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_directly_imaged_exoplanets" target="_blank">only a handful have been found so far</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
