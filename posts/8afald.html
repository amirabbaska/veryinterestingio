		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap is a detergent, meaning one side of the soap molecule is hydrophilic, while one is hydrophobic. Cellular membranes(such that of bacteria) are made of lipids, which are basically the same thing, having a hydrophobic and hydrophilic side. The only difference is that the hydrophobic tails of lipids like to stick together to form long chains two-lipids thick, keeping the hydrophilic heads outside and the tails inside. Detergents, however, like to stick together in spheres, also keeping the tails inside, and the heads outside. Washing your hands with soap allows the detergent to stick to the cell membranes and pluck out lipid molecules to form the spheres that detergent normally would, allowing the detergent to completely destroy cell membranes of bacteria. Bonus: Why our skin isn't affected by the soap is because our skin has a layer of keratin, the same stuff as nails or hair. The keratin layer makes it so the detergent can't touch our skin cells and destroy them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I actually know this.</p>
<p>Soap molecules have a water soluble side and a oil soluble side which forces them to make little bubbles called micelles naturally. Based on this structure, bits of dirt and grime (and bacteria!) which wouldn't be scooped away by running water alone are lifted away into the micelles which rinse away with water.</p>
<p>The bacteria doesn't stand a chance; soap is really an amazing discovery. Different soaps all do the same thing, whether or not they foam up or smell nice. In fact, some companies use foaming agents as a psychological thing to make you think &quot;damn, this soap is really working!!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We did an experiment in Microbio where we used hand soap, hand sanitizer, rubbed our hands on our jeans for 60 seconds, or did nothing and then put that handprint on an agar plate.  In every instance, jeans rubbed hands were the cleanest, soap the second cleanest.  Some hand sanitizer plates were dirtier than doing nothing.  Since then I make sure to dry my hands really well and roughly when washing them.</p>
<p>Our profâ€™s explanation was that rubbing breaks the bacterial cell bodies and/or sloughs off the dead skin which was carrying the bacteria.  She also speculated that people running their hand right against the hand sanitizer bottles may be what caused an overgrowth of bacteria on those plates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
