<p>say an air/silicon interface is irradiated with a laser. Some light is transmitted, some is reflected. Is the reflection only happening from the first row of atoms? Or is there some penetration depth from which the light can still find its way back? And if the latter is the case, how big is it? And does it still preserve the same angle as the light that is scattered back from the first row of atoms? What's going on exactly? (PhD student asking)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/bencbartlett has provided an excellent answer that touches on the quantum mechanical nature of light.</p>
<p>Let me answer from a more classical/continuum optics perspective. Light reflection occurs (like at the air/silicon interface) because the index of refraction between light and air is different. Light reflection ONLY occurs at interfaces where the index of refraction is different (which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index-matching_material" target="_blank">index-matching</a> is so useful).</p>
<p>So when a beam of light strikes an interface, the difference in the index of refraction between the two surfaces determines how much is reflected and how much is transmitted in accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations" target="_blank">Fresnel equations.</a> </p>
<p>So let's posit your scenario: A set of two interfaces between air and silicon, and then silicon and silicon. Maybe you get two wafers infinitely close to each other, or you can just draw an imaginary line between two layers of atoms. Because there's no index of refraction difference between the two layers, there's no reflection and 100% of light is transmitted.</p>
<p>I have the sense based on your question that you're thinking/learning about ellipsometry? Or maybe one of the associated techniques? I'm happy to answer follow-ups, my PhD used ellipsometry extensively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BSSRDF (Bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function or B surface scattering RDF) describes the relation between outgoing radiance and the incident flux, including the phenomena like subsurface scattering (SSS). The BSSRDF describes how light is transported between any two rays that hit a surface.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function</a></p>
<p>BSSRDF includes models to describe how the subsurface of objects scatter light. They are very common and used all the time when rendering Animated Movies and CGI content. Skin is known to scatter light under the surface, there is research out there that tries to model this so we can simulate skin more realistically.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electric field of the incoming light doesn't stop at the surface - it penetrates the material and in the case of visible light on silicon attenuates rapidly.  The penetration depth where the light has fallen to 1/e is around lambda/(4<em>pi</em>K) where K is the complex index of refraction of the material.  For 532 nm  visible light (bright green laser diode) K is about 0.05.  Put the numbers in and you get about 850 nm - a hair less than a micron.  Green light penetrates roughly 1 micron into silicon - that is several thousands of atomic layers deep (lattice spacing is roughly 0.5 nm).    This is a real penetration - shine a beam of green light onto silicon and the beam shifts sideways as if the reflection point was not on the surface.    Make the silicon thinner than a micron and green light will come out the other face.   This is true for all real materials - the penetration depth is always greater than zero.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
