		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember my dreams and my wife says I thrash around almost every night. The last dream I do remember having was a few years ago.</p>
<p>We live near Seattle, WA but this dream took place somewhere like New York city, big front steps leading to the buildings front door. It was only my 5 year old daughter and myself.  We are getting out of the car, maybe a cab and I don't recognize any of this but my daughter does and she's excited to see who/what we are visiting. She starts running down the sidewalk and to one of the stairs, she's running freely and laughing, so excited. I'm trying to run after her but I can't run, it's like I'm in water I just can't move very fast.</p>
<p>She runs up the stairs and I'm in slow motion right behind her, she runs into the home and the door slams shut. This is where I have a hard time repeating it.</p>
<p>Her laughs turn into screams. She's calling for me, she needs me. I can hear dogs, maybe wolves growling. She's scared, I can't open the door. Whatever was behind that door starts to rip my daughter apart. I can hear everything. I'm starting to cry right now just thinking about it. Her screams turn into agony and then silent and all I can hear is whatever is chewing on my daughter. </p>
<p>Her screams haunt me. I couldn't help her. I'm glad I don't remember my dreams. I suffer from ptsd. I was in an accident when I was 17 and I killed a student at my school when she was Jay walking. I've never really received proper help. I've always rejected it because it's too painful to deal with what happened. I'm 35 now.</p>
<p>I wish I could control my dreams. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dreaming involves using our current knowledge to truly generate scenes and situations.  We can defy those things we know (e.g., flying in dreams, which isn't possible in real life), but because we are constructing them ourselves, it would make sense for us to have a lower chance of questioning our own creations.</p>
<p>Related, does anyone know how and why creativity is still possible in dreams, whereas logic/reasoning is allegedly &quot;turned off&quot;?  That is, about once every few months I dream of freestyle rapping (which I love to do in real life), and upon waking up, I can usually remember 2-4 of the rhymes, which are things truly pertinent to stuff in the dream.  </p>
<p>Also, many years ago, I actually made a creative, stupid dad-joke (I dreamt I was badly falling asleep in school, and I told a friend &quot;I'm about to crash like Windows 98&quot;.  I had never thought of that beforehand).  What is going on here?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same answer as to why a dream can seem to encompass years in a single night. You aren't really &quot;thinking&quot; while dreaming; it's fundamentally similar to remembering, except with much less structure, so it comes out all mashed together, weird and haphazard. In fact, in those odd instances when you <em>do</em> question things or realize it's a dream, it's because you're remembering thinking about questioning something, or thinking about your dreams (can also be because you're starting to wake up).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I've noticed when I have dreams is that I occasionally have a single moment of rational thought, which almost always involves me saying out loud in the dream &quot;wait a sec, is this a dream?&quot; followed immediately by waking up. This doesn't happen all the time, and it typically happens in really bizarre dreams, but without fail I always wake up when I say it in the dream. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
