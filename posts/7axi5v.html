		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's probably a rare case, but I don't think it produces any major threats to current galaxy theory. It does take a while for galaxies to settle down and form a disk like this, especially since it's thought that during these early times they'd be going through a number of major and minor mergers with other objects, but if it's had a relatively quiet history I don't think it's impossible to form a disk so early.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are going by the image shown in most articles, that image is strictly a &quot;representation&quot; of a spiral galaxy. The actual galaxy was determined to exist by gravitational lensing, so it would look smeared out in a crescent shape. I am sure a lot of interpretation of the image was needed to ascertain that it was a spiral galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I admit to being a relatively moronic person. So this thing that is 13.6 B light years away means that it's probably gone now correct?  What we are seeing is actually something from that much time before us?  I enjoy learning this stuff but sometimes I have a very hard time wrapping my head area such literal cosmic discoveries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the top comment pretty much covered it (that a well-formed galaxy that early doesn't really challenge our theories about galaxy formation), but I would like to say that it's not 2.6 billion years AFTER the Big Bang as much as 2.6 billion years INTO the Big Bang (or 2.6b years after the initiation of the Big Bang).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just had a thought: since we can age galaxies, can we look at them and try to see where a larger concentration of 'old' galaxies lie to determine which direction this all started in (where the big bang took place)?</p>
<p>Or does it not work that way because it didn't so much explode into an existing space but expanded into the space we have today meaning there's gonna be old no matter where we look?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
