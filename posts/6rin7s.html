		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once glycogen stores are depleted, the body will switch metabolic pathways and activate a process called ketosis.  This is where the body uses its own fat for energy (triglycerides are converted into ketones in the liver, which the body can then use for fuel).  </p>
<p>An obese person would also likely have a greater store of nutrients (magnesium/potassium/sodium etc) to use during the time of fasting.  </p>
<p>If you google 'longest fast' you'll probably stumble upon a research paper detailing a fast where a man went from 467 lbs to 180 over the course of 387 days or so.  They gave him some Mg supplements after a few months, but it was questionable whether or not he needed them.  </p>
<p>When you are consuming carbohydrates regularly, the body is running on the glycogen pathway, and since your body can really only store ~2000 or so USABLE glycogen calories, people feel very hungry once this supply starts running low.  This is why fat people continue to stuff their face instead of fasting (and also psychological reasons).  </p>
<p>However, even with someone at a normal weight, they most likely have ~120,000 FAT calories on their body at any given time.  But in order to use them more effectively, the body must transition into using the ketone metabolic pathway (it won't automatically switch if the body is still being fed, or still has glycogen in the liver to use).  So once your body runs out of glycogen, and realizes it isn't being fed anymore, it will switch to using the fat stores for energy, and these fat cells will be converted into ketones (betahydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) in the liver, which can then be used by the body for fuel.  The brain and heart especially prefer ketones to glucose, and they are a much 'cleaner' burning fuel than glycogen to use for the organs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, their bodies have more fat to feed off of and therefore they can technically starve longer than people of lower weights. </p>
<p>However, they aren't guaranteed to survive longer. They could face other problems without food that are related to their obesity such as low blood sugar, low vitamins/minerals, etc. which could potentially kill them before the starvation would. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't currently find the source but I am sure the information is correct.
Disclaimer: Some words may be spelled incorrectly, typing fast and English is my third language.</p>
<p>When not eating your body can start using up your fat to produce energy. Most of your cells can live just fine burning up fatty acids but can't replace lost micronutrients like iron or vitamins (assuming they are drinking distilled water without anything added). </p>
<p>Notice how I said most cells, neurons are tricky. In normal conditions they will only consume glucose. They can't even process other sugars so there are helper cells (microglia cells) whose job is to keep these picky eaters fed. In fasting conditions neurones can run on ketone bodies. The fastidious thing is that ketone bodies can only be procured from glicerol in triglicerids (a small constituent of body fat, the molecule that binds toghether fatty acids) or from protein degradation. Because you are not eating you will start to burn proteins to keep your brain alive. As proteins are ground up and fed to the big guy upstairs the rest of systems will start to fail. As cells fail to function without some proteins they will die and leave all sorts of nasty death-related products lying arround effectively poisoning you.</p>
<p>Another factor to take into account is that obese people don't just have more fat, they have more cells to store all that fat. This means that although they have more energy reserves they also have more energy demands.</p>
<p>The original question assumed they stayed hydrated but:
Burning fat takes a LOT of water and as I said overweight people have a higher energy demand so without water (or the same water but just enough for a slim person) the overweight one would die first.</p>
<p>And the final deviation from the original, if the fat person is not simply overweight but extremely overweight i.e. morbidly obese; as they burn protein they grow weaker and become unable to move due to the extra weight (not yet burned up when muscle weakness sets in) so unless they have outside assistance they are pretty rubbish all arround when starving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they would take much longer to starve to death. Fat contains a lot of energy, and that energy can be accessed by the body.</p>
<p>That being said, there are various issues that could come up and kill them long before they starved to death.</p>
<p>Certain micronutrients (the water-soluble ones, as opposed to fat-soluble ones - in particular, the B-complex vitamins and vitamin C) aren't substantially stored in fat, meaning that starving yourself for a long period of time can result in deficiencies in these micronutrients, which would eventually prove fatal. That is why obese people who fast are given supplements.</p>
<p>Another issue is that people who starve themselves appear to have much higher rates of organ failure, particularly heart attacks. The exact mechanism is unknown.</p>
<p>A third issue is that your body will break down muscles while starving yourself, requiring exercise to avoid loss of muscle mass.</p>
<p>So they would take a lot longer than a regular-weight person to starve to death, but other issues could well kill them before they actually ran out of caloric energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
