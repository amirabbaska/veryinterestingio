		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one thing, Hollywood is an American industry that likes to make movies about American characters.  Since American troops only arrived in the final year of the war, there isn't much time for a story.</p>
<p>For another thing, the Western Front was pretty much stagnant for most of the war.  &quot;We're in our trench and they're in their trench, and we're both getting blown to bits by artillery&quot; doesn't make for a very compelling action movie.  The Eastern and other fronts were much more active, but again, a movie about Russians fighting Germans is a hard sell to Hollywood executives.</p>
<p>Finally, WWI didn't have a Hollywood &quot;win&quot;.  Audiences want a happy ending, and &quot;we decided to stop fighting, and Germany conceded some territory&quot; isn't very satisfying.  The complicated politics that led up to the war also makes it more difficult to paint the Germans as villains.  With WWII it's much simpler: &quot;Nazis = evil&quot; is the easiest villain story there is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As morbid as this sounds, World War 1 was one of the first non-glorious wars.</p>
<p>The advent of the machine gun came along either right before or during WW1, before the development of any substantial form of armor. This led to long drawn-out stalemates between infantry, long days of trench lines sending doomed charges across &quot;no man's land&quot; for a bunch of guys to get mowed down by machine gun fire, only for the other side to decide to charge a little while later to have <em>their</em> soldiers gunned down by machine gun fire.</p>
<p>Basically, the sort of heroics and gallantry that made war fun to talk about after the fact were virtually impossible to survive in WW1 and so by the end of it, everyone involved was pissed off, tired, and didn't want to talk about it anymore.</p>
<p>Compounding that, the underlying reasons for the war just weren't as compelling from a narrative standpoint: there wasn't <em>really</em> an &quot;evil&quot; side, it was a bunch of nation-states involved in backroom politics and alliances that popped off into a huge war when an archduke got assassinated.</p>
<p>Compare to the historical legacy of WWII, where we had a charismatic psychopath with a genocidal streak taking over a country and militarizing it, then going on a campaign to conquer the world in the name of the &quot;Aryan Race&quot; and a band of nations who were technologically behind the aggressors and on the back-foot managed to hold him off long enough to change the tide of the war, mirrored in the Pacific theater by what the Japanese army was doing in Nanking and then eventually attacking Pearl Harbor...</p>
<p>It's also possibly the last war where America could claim almost entirely good-guy status. We fought against literally Hitler, and as this sentence demonstrates he's basically <em>the</em> bad guy in history, as far as a lot of people are concerned.</p>
<p>There's nuance here too, of course. There always is. But the fact that that narrative <em>can exist</em> from the facts of WW2 means that it's a ripe setting for tales of heroism. Circling back: armored divisions had caught up to the arms of the day, and heroics were back in style and actually survivable, and we did a lot to promote our war heroes to keep domestic support of the war as high as we could, since one bad election meant losing support, pulling out of the war, and (at the time, at least, it seemed like) letting Hitler take over Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>WWII was much more recent. Not long ago, a <em>huge</em> number of WWII veterans were still alive. And many Europeans were still living through the aftermath and the rebuilding.</li>
<li>Movie cameras were extensively present in WWII, capturing real footage.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WWII combines a number of elements that make it a major focal point for pop culture. </p>
<ol>
<li>It's the bloodiest conflict in the history of the world. An estimated 80 million people died during the conflict (that's over four times as many as died in WWI). </li>
<li>It was extensively documented, more-so than any conflict prior. There's more film footage and photographs of the war than a single person could view in a lifetime. </li>
<li>The atrocities of WWII are particularly horrific, which captures the mind. Death camps, gas chambers, atomic bombs, <del>almost half a million</del> about 12,000 dead on D-Day... </li>
<li>Related: there's a very very clear villain. People like when a conflict has a very clear &quot;good guy/bad guy&quot; dynamic, and WWII has pretty much the ultimate bad guy. WWII was a war over ideology, and that tension is easy turned into drama on the silver screen. </li>
<li>Also related: we have survivors still living who can tell their stories. </li>
<li>The technological advance between WWI and WWII was huge, and it's easy to create dynamic, exciting movies based on it. You get tanks, dogfights, bombing runs, and soldiers weren't just engaged in protracted trench warfare, they were storming beaches and fighting in the middle of cities. It's horrible, but it makes for very exciting movies. </li>
<li>WWII was incredibly significant and the effects are still felt today. The Cold War, the creation of Israel, the US's rise to a world superpower/the decline of Western European superpowers, rise of Communism in China and Eastern Europe, etc. </li>
