		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a Locomotive Engineer for the BNSF Railway for 10 years. The first answer to your question is that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (Engineers Union) is the oldest in the country at 152 years and we have fought tooth and nail to keep our jobs. That being said, the second answer is a little more complicated.  </p>
<p>The bulk of modern road locomotives are manufactured by General Electric. A road Locomotive is a six axle 4400 horsepower engine that is meant to travel at track speed between cities. This is opposed to a yard Locomotive which is four axles and only meant to travel at 10 mph in short intervals though it is capable of track speed (up to 70mph). </p>
<p>A General Electric Locomotive comes with proprietary software in the locomotives heads up display called the GE Trip Optomizer. The T.O. as we call it is essentially auto pilot. Once engaged, it is capable of speeding up or slowing down the train at speeds of 12-70 mph. It uses algorithms to determine how to handle the train in the most fuel efficient manner while managing &quot;in train forces,&quot; but more on that later. The T.O. Uses GPS to determine exact locations to comply with both permanent and temporary speed restrictions. In my experience the T.O. Is accurate within 50 feet which is nothing short of miraculous considering the computer has to discern variables such as train tonnage (weight) both as a whole and individual cars and where they are placed in the train. Also train length and curvature of the territory. Whether or not you are on an ascending or descending grade (up a Mountain or down one).</p>
<p>As an Engineer in 2017 I am needed at the controls of a Locomotive for the following reasons. First, T.O. Doesn't always work, nor is it present in all of our locomotives (some are made by EMD.) Second, T.O. Doesn't work at speeds below 12 mph, so I have to start the train out and then engage the T.O. Once I get over 12. Third, T.O. Only works when I have authority to travel at track speed for a great distance. For example, if I have authority for 6 miles or more, I will engage the T.O. If I have to stop at some point within about six miles, I have to take control of the train and get it stopped at the correct location while complying with good train handling procedures. The T.O. Is only able to operate at maximum authorized speed all the time. It does not stop the train. That is the job of an engineer. Imagine a self driving car that can only handle itself on Interstate highways at the posted speed limit and cannot drive down a street with traffic lights and comply with the signals. Same concept. </p>
<p>Stopping the train without snapping it in two is the main job of a Locomotive Engineer. It's like a musician making music with an instrument. It takes training and experience. There are two types of brakes used on a train. First are the Dynamic Brakes, which are only found on Locomotives. That is where each axle acts as an electric generator. Imagine a hand crank emergency radio or flashlight. When you turn the crank there is resistance on the handle which is generating power. We use the resistance on each axle to slow down the train by generating electricity. We then literally throw away all that valuable electricity by dissipating it as heat out the top of the engine. It's a tremendous waste but hey, that's how we roll in America. </p>
<p>The second type of brakes that we use and probably the biggest reason to keep trains manned is the Westinghouse Air Brake System. Each rail car is equipped with brake rigging which operates entirely on compressed air. There are no electrical components, everything is mechanical. There are air compressors on the locomotives that are connected to each car through the use of air hoses and the entire system is controlled by the engineer at the head end of the train. The speed of the train can be controlled by either taking away air (setting the brakes) or adding air (releasing the brakes). I know that sounds backwards but that's how the system was designed. </p>
<p>It is the Westinghouse air brake design that truly throws a wrench into the need for automation. You see, Westinghouse designed this system in the 19th century. That's right, the flipping 1800s. The Titans of industry at the time began to expand the railroads so rapidly that there was only time enough to redesign the system to be more efficient once. That also happened in the 1800s. So that means that in 2017 we still use this system to stop our trains. Every rail car on every piece of track in the United States has this type of brake rigging. And according to federal law, each car has to have tested, inspected and working air brakes BEFORE the train departs it's initial terminal. A Conductor, (that's the other guy in the cab) has to walk the entire length of the train three times before the train can depart, once on each side to ensure the brakes are set and once to ensure the brakes have released. That could be up to 7000+ feet three times (5280 feet in a mile!) </p>
<p>The Westinghouse air brake system, although used industry wide, has its flaws. The brakes have a tendency to &quot;dynamite&quot; or begin braking without warning. Imagine the brake on the rear car braking a full capacity and no other brakes in the train are working. This type of event cracks the whole train like a whip and the Conductor and Engineer are at the tip. At the very least we'll get greasy face prints on the windshield. At the worst we're looking at a train broken in two or possibly a derailment. In the remote locations that the railroad travels in, it is the job of trained professionals like us to inspect the train, possibly change a broken knuckle on a car (60 lbs), put the train back together (do another air test) and get on our way. </p>
<p>In using a temperamental system like this it falls upon he job of a human being to orchestrate the movements of the train through the use of his senses. Feel, what's going on behind you? Is there more slack in the train than you expected? Sound, are the brakes squealing? Is it possible that they are not all the way released? Smell, do you smell hot brake shoes? The smell of burnt rubber? Sight, look back at the train on a curve. Is it on fire? Is there dragging equipment? Taste, what's in my lunchbox? Is it time to put my steak and potato in the engine compartment to heat it up yet? </p>
<p>These are things that automation cannot replace, human intuition in the middle of nowhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends slightly on the region we're talking about, so I'll focus on the one I know most about, Europe. Things might differ slightly elsewhere. It's also going to be a bit more technical in nature.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It's much more expensive and difficult to automate trains, because of regulations, the lifespan of the rolling stock, and the infrastructure involved.</p>
<p>As others have already mentioned, a huge chunk (if not everything in someplaces) of the actual railway infrastructure is already automated, such as signals and switches. Computers have made humans mostly obsolete there already: We've used to have many and big mechanical systems to prevent mistakes, today it's a single computer easily dealing with large regions of the network.</p>
<p>Europe strives to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETCS" target="_blank">an unified system (ETCS)</a> which controls trains (and their safety measures), which means that a train can go from one point of Europe to the other without having to switch engines or even drivers. There are multiple levels, which bluntly put refer to the available technology on the rolling stock and the infrastructure. The lowest level is still using the &quot;normal&quot; signals, whereas the highest levels are not using signals at all, but requires trains to have a constant radio connection to a control center.</p>
<p>Lower ETCS levels do not offer you much choice in the way of automation, higher levels do. However, this is costly, as you need to upgrade your engines (which can easily last 50 or more years, and are expensive to replace) and add additional security infrastructure (cell towers to provide the radio connectivity). Depending on your geography, the latter can be tricky.</p>
<p>So one point is the cost of actually getting a system that we can safely automate. Another one is trust. Put differently, when asked &quot;Would you like to enter a metal box that's going very fast next to other boxes that are going very fast, and all these boxes are controlled by some computer very far away?&quot;, the answers you would get would probably be rather... conservative. Even with the amount of security we have these days, the software still has (smaller) flukes from time to time. A trained human operator can notice these mistakes and question the computer's decision, something that computers themselves have a harder time to do.</p>
<p>Another one is the security bit. Train tracks are often exposed due to their nature, and might even include dangerous zones such as railroad crossings or stations without under-/overpasses. A human driver can see those dangers and act accordingly. More importantly, they can see it on other tracks as well and warn other drivers. Because there's no real guide to how to build rail networks and most of that stuff has grown historically in any case, it's difficult to teach a computer to do that. It gets even worse when you consider that sometimes obstacles are allowed between tracks - for example posts for overhead wires, or signals.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the age of the rolling stock comes into play again. One part of being a train driver is to check the train for anything suspicious during the journey, especially on freight waggons. This can include brakes or axles that are running hot, or tarpaulins that have loosened and are now threatening to touch something (e.g. the overhead wires). We have systems on the railway tracks that can detect those, but not everywhere (they are usually placed in front of tunnels or terminus train stations), and they can't detect everything. The rail cars themselves are usually old and feature little to no technology in that regard, especially since they're usually used internationally and regulations (and therefore standards) vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the regulations: Depending on your country, railways are more or less regulated. Some of these regulations may make automation impossible, or just way too expensive. Especially if there was no push towards automation so far, chances are that some law changes will be required before you can even start thinking about upgrading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've answered this question once here regarding main rail (non subway trains) here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/52p2mw/eli5_we_are_coming_very_close_to_fully_automatic/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/52p2mw/eli5_we_are_coming_very_close_to_fully_automatic/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/52p2mw/eli5_we_are_coming_very_close_to_fully_automatic/</a></a></p>
<p>To get straight to the point, nothing is preventing them and there are in fact a lot of automated train systems in place in an urban rail setting, some with more automation than others.</p>
<p>First off lets see some examples of completely automated systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyTrain_\(Vancouver\)" target="_blank">Vancouver SkyTrain</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank">Morgantown PRT</a>.</p>
<p>Now why aren't all urban rail systems automated? Well there two main reason for it, the first is that there is a massive upfront cost to doing so though I'm sure many companies are working on dropping the cost like crazy and making the automated better. The second reason is unfortunately Unions. There are a crazy amount of extremely expensive automated rail systems both fully implemented and partially that exist but simply are not activated due to unions fighting them. Train drivers will first start seeing more and more of their controls automated before finally just sitting there watching the train controlling itself ready to intervene in case of any issues. Sooner or later though the drivers will lose out of their role and be transferred to a &quot;train supervisor&quot; type role to make sure everything is a-okay and to answer questions to passengers.</p>
<p>So why don't you know about them? Well the truth is because you aren't the client. No one is trying to sell you an automated train system. These systems are being shown off and sold to the people who own the trains whether they be large private businesses or cities. Cars on the other hand are being shown off and advertised because sooner or later they will be on the market for you.</p>
<p>Cars will eventually be self driving, a decent portion of trains (especially urban rail) already are  and there's a greater push for it happening behind closed doors than the public sees. In my personal opinion, the majority of urban rain will become self driving far sooner than the majority of cars become self driving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good comments here, about the non-deterministic things that humans do, the stakes (hundreds of passengers), and the remarkable extent to which trains are already automated.</p>
<p>However, there's one thing I don't see here yet: How much more efficiency can you gain by eliminating people entirely from trains? If a train carries 500 passengers or 100 cars of cargo, and has a technical staff (i.e. driving, navigating, communicating) of three or four, we're not going to change economies much by eliminating those three or four people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the United States:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many aspects of train operation <em>are</em> <a href="http://wate.com/2016/04/20/norfolk-southern-reducing-operations-at-knoxville-rail-yard/" target="_blank">automated</a>.  For instance in railyards there are automated locomotives for shifting cars around.  There's also a thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_train_control" target="_blank">positive train control</a> which allows for slowing and stopping trains automatically if something goes wrong, like if the engineer has a heart attack.  We are in the process of rolling this out across the United States (I helped a little!) but it's a big job and there have been some delaying factors.  Another part of the issue is that a lot of rail is waaaaay out in the middle of nowhere, so upgrading it with new infrastructure is expensive and time-consuming.  That's why a lot of these upgrades have been made on railyards in cities, but not everywhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>It's not the no-brainer that you think it is. There are lots of unpredictable things that can happen when operating trains.  There need to be humans on hand to deal with those things.  Also, consequences of a train screw-up are much bigger than consequences of a car crash; consider that a single train might be hauling hundreds of tons of toxic, flammable or hazardous chemicals, and so you need <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/hsem/planning-preparedness/Pages/minnesota-rail-safety-regulations.aspx" target="_blank">detailed safety plans in place</a> in case <a href="http://www.startribune.com/at-camp-ripley-national-guard-members-train-for-the-worst-cast-scenarios/322904531/" target="_blank">something goes wrong</a>.  For that reason, you don't want to introduce full automation out on the rails until you have it worked out really, really well.</li>
