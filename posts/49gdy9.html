		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Foreword: I'm a spinal cord biologist, but I work mostly with pain systems. Nonetheless, I've read a reasonable amount on sexual circuits in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>A lot of people are going to talk about brain chemistry, and that's definitely a huge part of it. But it's still very poorly understood.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: Since this is hard to explain, let me try and be simpler. Not my greatest skill.</strong></p>
<p>Your spinal cord is full of nerve cells which largely either A) control reflexes, B) execute movement or C) send mildly processed information to the brain. Some of them near your lower back (lumbar spine) respond specifically to genital stimulation, and will become intensely active during ejaculation. They send information simultaneously to the ejaculation muscles as well as the brain, and these cells are thought to be responsible for telling the brain to feel good!</p>
<p>These cells are similar to the cells that send pain information to the brain. Similarly to pain, they receive a serotonin input from higher brain regions which silences these cells. This is thought to be part of the reason why anti-depressants have a libido-lowering effect. Like pain, libido must be suppressed in emotionally intense situations presumably so that you can be compelled to remove yourself from danger.</p>
<p>It is also the reason I think that the spinal cord is highly responsible for what we know as libido, and that sexual thoughts will activate spinal cells, which will then send information back up to the brain that says &quot;hey, now you're aroused!&quot; To support this, there are distinct areas of the brain which only receives spinal input from these specialized lumbar cells. However, there's only a handful of studies done on this part of the brain and it really needs more attention.</p>
<p>Because of this, I think sexual dysfunction (if you want to use that term, since everyone has their own definition of sexually normal) research should examine spinal cord circuits and therapies which target them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In men, a hormone called prolactin increases after orgasm. This will cause a lack of interest in sex, difficulty in achieving an erection and orgasming. It is primarily responsible for the 'refractory period'. </p>
<p>There is a prolactin lowering drug called cabergoline which can drastically reduce the refractory period and make some men multi-orgasmic.</p>
<p>Prolactin is also responsible for causing women to lactate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone for the sexual tension, oxytocin for the orgasm, prolactin for the refractory period. It's a soup of hormones originating from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the brain which constantly fluctuate.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is also the hormone responsible for feelings of affection for another person. In females, oxytocin is responsible for uterine contractions during labour and helps milk express from the nipple during breastfeeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
