		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you open the fridge, some of the cold air inside is replaced by warm air from outside. On closing, you trap this warm air inside. It really quickly cools down and therefore &quot;shrinks&quot; a little bit. This causes a slight underpressure inside the fridge. On a big fridge door this tiny pressure difference can even be enough for you to be unable to pry it open by hand. With time, the pressure equalizes with the outside due to the less than perfect seal (and a tiny hole for condensed water in the back in some cases)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: As some commenters reminded me, I forgot to mention a second mechanism:</p>
<p>Due to the very flexible sealing on the door, just closing the lid with a little bit of force is sufficient to create a small vacuum. As you close the door, you compress the sealing slightly and therefore the overall volume inside the fridge gets smaller and some air is forced out. After that, the sealing expands again, the volume goes up, but no air can rush back in to fill this volume because now the door is completely closed. So again you have slightly lower pressure inside and the door is stuck. This is the same mechanism how these small suction cups for towels etc. work: you press, air goes out, can't come back in.</p>
<p>In my experience, this effect is usually too small to explain the whole phenomenon, but it helps to get an initial seal so that the cooling air can to its work properly. If you have a freezer with internal fans, the cooling effect is definitely the main culprit as the air is completely cooled down in seconds. They are stuck no matter how carefully you close the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>What I didn't mention before: the force that holds the door shut if there is no pressure difference usually comes from the seals themselves. They often contain a magnetic strip to ensure a good seal to the frame. So yeah, magnets!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because warm air will create a greater pressure than cold air when at a fixed volume. When you open the fridge the cold air inside is replaced with warmer air from outside the fridge. When the door is closed, all the cold items inside the fridge rapidly begin to cool this warm air in the fridge back to its original, cold temperature. This cooling of air creates a vacuum effect and makes the fridge difficult to open. This effect only last as long as it takes for the small leaks in the fridge to make up the difference in air pressure.</p>
<p>This effect is easy to see for yourself. Fill a water bottle with hot water. Then dump out all the how water and immediately close the lid on the bottle. Now, run cold water over the outside of the bottle. As the air inside the bottle cools, you will notice that the pressure will decrease. This results in a decrease in the volume of the  water bottle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you open the door room temperature air enters the fridge.</p>
<p>When you close the door the air trapped inside is cooled, causing it to contract.</p>
<p>The contracting air creates a partial vacuum, which makes the door harder to open.</p>
<p>After some time air infiltration around the door gasket equalizes the pressure on either side of the door.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
