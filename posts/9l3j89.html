<ol>
<li>suspend body in really strong magnetic field, forces water molecules to line themselves up in specific direction</li>
<li>at same time, zap water molecules in body with a radio wave, causes them to wiggle against magnetic field direction</li>
<li>wiggling water molecules give off their own radio waves, slightly different for each kind of tissue. Record it all &amp; use computer to reconstruct 3D picture of it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a spinning top wants to be straight up? Even when you push it (a little) it is happiest when pointing straight upwards. The top even makes a little &quot;woosh&quot; sound when going back up again.</p>
<p>Well your body is full of these tiny spinning tops of different sizes that are happily spinning around.</p>
<p>You can make these spinning tops spin the same way using a really big magnet (they now all point the same way and spin at the same speed). Using a radio we can give some of the tops a little push and listen to the tiny &quot;woosh&quot; sounds the tops make to hear where they are located.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>If you want to delve a little deeper take a look at this (short) <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~martin/Tools/MRI_Made_Easy.pdf" target="_blank">book: MRI made easy</a> (link immediately downloads). It's written with non-technical people in mind and very complete and understandable given how insanely difficult the subject is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is my ELI5 of this, because I think that the math of how this works is simply beautiful.</p>
<p>You are made up of atoms. All different kinds of atoms. Lots of these atoms are hydrogen. Hydrogen is a special atom cuz it is so simple. It acts like a spinning magnet cuz it is so simple.</p>
<p>Now normally, all your hydrogen atoms are pointed random directions, so you aren't magnetic. But if we put you in a strong enough magnetic field, the field it'll push and pull on these magnets. They line up. It makes all the atoms point up or down. But half of them are pointed up, and half of them are pointed down. So while they are lined up, they cancel each other out, so they still aren't magnetic.</p>
<p>However, since they are lined up now, we can &quot;wack&quot; them with another magnetic pulse. This turns all the magnets to the side. Suddenly they are all pointed in the same direction! You become briefly magnetic, and we can listen to that with an antenna.</p>
<p>However we only wacked the atoms, the big strong magnetic field still wants all the atoms to line up. And our atoms are still spinning, just like a top. So, just like a spinning top after getting wacked, the atoms rock around as they line up again. This causes them to ring. Because all the atoms are so simple, they all spin in approximate unison. If you are next to your neighbors you can sing louder and longer than someone by themselves. This gives us a weird coral note. By wack again in the middle of the note, we can get other notes, sort of like playing the song at a faster tempted. Sometimes we have to wack really fast (this is what makes all the noises in the MRI machine).</p>
<p>Once we get a picture of all the notes over time, and with different pulse intervals, we get a chart of the chorus that your body made. By literally looking at the magnitude of the notes Harmony we can put together the picture of you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you put a really powerful magnet on something that has water, that water will act like a compass, and point to the direction of the magnet. Then you use another magnet to push that water, it causes it to act like a spinning top, and will rotate. With enough water spinning together, it behaves like a magnet itself, and you can read how strong of a magnet it is. Now next to different things, water rotates either quickly or slowly, that allows us to distinguish between one thing to another. That encompasses what's called NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance).</p>
<p>MRI is taking it one step further. We want only a small set of that water to do what we said, so we use another magnet to choose only part of it. How that's achieved is a bit more than 5 year old level, but basically we listen in to only what we want each time. We get a really distorted picture that we need to understand how to rebuild into a picture that you see. It's not like X-Ray where you get the entire picture in one go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the physics explanations, the reason it is so useful to visualize soft tissue is that it is exploiting the spin of the hydrogen atom and two very abundant substances in the body are hydrogen rich: fat and water.  Different imaging sequences use different timing to make different types of tissue to appear different. While X-ray and CT imaging are looking at density of tissue, MRI can characterize tissue based on the appearance on each sequence.  Inflammation shows as water on imaging, think of swelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
