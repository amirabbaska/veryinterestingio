<p>I am wondering if doubling/tripling of the mass of hydrogen in complex hydrocarbons has a chance of affecting its structure, and consequently, its reactability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what happens when a tritium isotope decays in a hydrocarbon to the hydrocarbon?</p>
<p>Finally, as cause for this whole question, would tritiated ethanol behave any differently to normal ethanol?</p></div></div>

<p>Tritium exists at low natural abundance and is a soft beta emitter, so effects from its decay are minimal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As people pointed out, you have the Kinetic Isotope Effect, if a chemical reaction involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom, then the kinetics of that reaction. But you're also lowering the fundamental vibrational frequency of the H-X bond, which has a number of effects. It changes the vibrational energy levels and thus infrared absorption (which is why water is faintly blue while heavy water is not - <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4gay.gif" target="_blank">water absorbs more in the red</a>). It also has a slight effect on hydrogen bonding strength - which is why heavy water has a boiling point a degree above ordinary water, a slightly different viscosity etc.</p>
<p>However, with hydrocarbons you don't have hydrogen bonding or much going on with the hydrogen atoms, so less would happen there. With ethanol you'd have a much larger change in boiling point and viscosity etc if the -OH group hydrogen was swapped for tritium than one of the C-H hydrogens. Because that group is hydrogen-bonding and responsible for more of the intermolecular bonding energy than the other hydrogens.</p>
<p>When a tritium isotope decays, that energy is far in excess of the chemical bonding energy. Your helium-3 ion is going to go flying off in one direction and the beta-decay electron in the other before the molecule has any time to go anywhere. So you'll usually be left with a fragment like a CH3CH2O^* radical. But the high-energy ion and free electron are quite likely going to go off and blast apart some other molecules on their way too. </p>
<p>So yes, tritiated alcohol would behave very slightly different, with the extent depending a lot on whether it's a C-H or O-H hydrogen you swap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In mass spectrometry we use deuterium or tritium doped molecules as internal standards. When you use the exact same chemical (except for a few hydrogens) the structure may or may not change, but the doped molecule will undergo basically the same chemistry while being analyzed and will allow you to do very precise quantification even if it's a complex sample. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It affects the reactivity of the chemical bond (kineitic isotope effect). The structure isn't really affected, BUT in X-rays, C-D bonds appear slightly longer than C-H bonds (they aren't actually longer though). That is because C-H bonds vibrate more so the &quot;average&quot; distance along the bonding axis <em>appears</em> smaller (X-ray libration).</p>
<p>That being said, the boiling point of deuterated water is 101 instead of 100 degrees Centigrade. You can think of deuterium having more &quot;inertia&quot; which needs to be overcome when breaking O-D or C-D bonds. Because deuterum bonds are slightly more difficult to break, increasing the % of deuterium in your body from around 1% to about 30% is believed to be lethal, since some reactions inside the cell would be slowed down.</p>
<p>I would expect tritiated ethanol to have a boiling point maybe around 1 degree centigrade above regular ethanol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if anyone shared the bio-pharmacological effects of deuterium, particularly deuterated drugs.</p>
<p>Here's a good read:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579527/#!po=0.724638" target="_blank">Deuterated Drugs Review</a> </p>
<p>Tl;Dr: There is promise, because C-D bonds are slightly stronger than C-H bonds, but nothing revolutionary yet.</p>
<p>There is actually a deuterated drug on the market called Austedo. Here's the published phase 3 trial:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28668671/?i=8&amp;from=deutetrabenazine" target="_blank">Austedo Phase III Trial</a> </p>
<p>To my knowledge no controlled randomized comparison between Deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine has not been published, yet.</p>
<p>Edit: So it may be that deuterated or trittiated ethanol would have a different or more potent effect than ethanol. Also it would be far more expensive so if the hope is to get more drunk with less alcohol you better have a budget like Bill Gates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
