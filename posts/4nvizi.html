		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most dinosaur sternums are made of cartilage and do not fossilize. Birds sternums are ossified. Flight requires some serious muscle, nice to have a hard surface for that muscle to attach too.<br />
In the early 20th century the lack of non-avian dinosaur sternums was used as evidence that birds were not dinosaurs! We now know that those sternums were cartilage (found in sharks, your nose^assuming ^you're ^a ^human). Being a soft tissue, cartilage has a very low probability of being fossilized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all: pterosaurs aren't dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Second of all, laziness probably. The sternal elements in most dinosaurs except ankylosaurs, <em>Limusaurus</em>, dromaeosaurs, troodontids, jeholornithiforms, and pygostylians are unfused, which makes them more difficult to mount. This is also why the gastralia are often missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unable to speak with confidence about dinosaurs as they're not my field. But I would guess that, (aside from obvious differences), if they were anything like humans or other current-era animals then the answer would be because they weren't ossified until late development. In humans, for example, sternums aren't fully ossified (i.e. modelled into normal bone) until about the age of thirty, and in other species this may be later. Cartilage would decompose like other soft tissue during the fossilisation process, meaning that dinosaurs would not have bone sternums until they reached older ages, making it rarer to find them in dug-up specimens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Huh...Looks like the answer is &quot;Because they didn't have them&quot;</p>
<p>I can't find a good source discussing this trait (though it seems that some <a href="https://sixdays.org/dinosaurs-evolved-to-birds-impossible" target="_blank">evolution-deniers</a> use this to 'Prove' that dinosaurs could not have evolved into birds).</p>
<p>What I can find is reference to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniraptora" target="_blank">Maniraptora</a> as the only known group of dinosaurs to have a breast-bone. So this is an actual biological phenomenon that you're observing and not just related to how the skeletons are preserved or displayed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
