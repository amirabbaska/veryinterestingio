<p>The astronaut is having a very difficult time moving himself. He has to practically &quot;swim&quot; through the air, and since the air provides very little resistance, it takes him a lot of effort to do so. Without air he would have had no way to do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From our current understanding of physics, no there is no other way. You need reaction mass to move. But it doesn't mean you have to use some object on yourself because presumably you are floating within an atmosphere which you can push against. A fan would work, as would blowing air with your mouth (although slowly of course). Spitting would also be a bit helpful without being a lasting sacrifice. Flapping your arms and legs would work too, but it would be a lot better if you had something large and flat you could waggle back and forth like a fish tail.</p>
<p>If you had a super long time you could just expose more skin in one direction and insulate the rest of your body, letting your body heat radiation push you along. But in an atmosphere the movement of air would overpower such an effect and you would probably starve to death before you got anywhere. But conceptually there is some thrust from that!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
