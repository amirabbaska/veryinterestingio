		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit!</p>
<p>We are a plant ecology research lab at Monmouth University. We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. </p>
<p>In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.</p>
<p>Ask us your ecological questions and we'll be on around 1pm Eastern Time (17 UT) to start answering! Ask us anything!</p>
<p>EDIT: Our guests have left for the time being. They had a great time and have said they may come back later to answer more of your questions!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you seen the Jersey Devil yet, and is there evidence that he likes cranberries? And also, have you seen any detrimental effects to the pinelands ecosystem from cranberry agriculture? Traditional forms of agriculture cause issues with habitat fragmentation and pesticides entering the environment, so I'm curious if cranberry bogs had similar problems or did their own forms of damage. Thanks for taking the time to do this! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
