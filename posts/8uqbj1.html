Believe it or not though women tend to run warmer than men as far as core body temp goes, though their extremities (hands/feet) are significantly colder than those of a man.
It’s quite interesting to see how it’s broken down in <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-do-womens-bodies-run-colder-than-mens-836827770" target="_blank">this article</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Heat is taken from girls arms and legs and given to the tummy area which makes girls feel a little colder on the outside than boys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women have several things that make them feel colder, and they have to do with making them better able to carry a child. </p>
<p>Women tend to have slightly higher body temps than men on average, which means that what they sense as being cold will be slightly higher than what men do. </p>
<p>And they also tend to have poorer circulation in their extremities which will make their hands and feet more likely to be cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
