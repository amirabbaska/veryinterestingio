Every light in both areas is timed to cycle the opposite of the lights on either side of it, so there's no way to &quot;catch&quot; more than one light at a time as while one light is green, the next will be red.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Background: Served on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for a major Canadian city. Involved in design/implementation of roadworks, including intelligent stoplight systems. </p>
<p>Some background on stoplights:</p>
<p>There are multiple kinds of stoplights, the most basic just running on a simple timer-based system. Every so many seconds, the lights change, but there is no awareness of the traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Some more advanced stoplights contain vehicle sensors embedded in the roadway at or before the stop line. These sensors feed information into the light control system, allowing it to make intelligent decisions. For instance, if you have a minor road intersecting a major road, there may be sensors placed on the minor road, so that the lights only cycle when there is a car waiting to cross. Sometimes they are used to signal a preemptive left turn light. The civil engineers will space out two sensors 4-5 car lengths apart, and if both sensors are covered it means there are at least that many cars queuing, and the advance left will allow those cars to proceed first. Most major intersections have at least a few roadway sensors. </p>
<p>The most advanced systems allow the lights to communicate and can be timed to allow waves of traffic. In my city, there is an Intersection Control Centre, with live feeds from cameras at each intersection, and the ability to adjust intersection timings on the fly. Priority routes are identified, along with traffic flows during certain times of the day. The stoplights along these priority routes are then synchronized, taking into account the relative speed of the traffic and the speed limits. If you're going with the priority flow of traffic, you'll hit at most one red light, after which point you'll be synchronized with the traffic flow, and you should hit all greens, as long as you drive the speed limit. If you drive too fast, you'll hit each red just as it turns green. </p>
<p>If you're hitting all the reds, you might be going in the wrong direction, or you're just really unlucky. I highly doubt that your city is specifically engineering the light cycles to slow you down. If anything, they'd be aiming to speed you up. </p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So this blew up overnight. I'll try to answer a bunch of questions that people have had.</p>
<p>I'm not an industry professional, I've just been in the scene with them for awhile. I work in IT, not traffic engineering.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There's no big &quot;Traffic Engineering&quot; bible that every engineer uses. Different cities can do wildly different things, and all we can do is speculate. There's no way to answer &quot;My road is optimized for exactly 42mph at 11am, why is that?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are really good at finding patterns where there aren't any. Conspiracy theorists abound! If the lights in your city are messing with you, they probably aren't. Having said that, weirder things have happened. <em>shrug</em> It's certainly possible for clever engineers to slow traffic down or to speed traffic up. I'd bet dollars to donuts that they do this in Vegas, as many people have mentioned. A few people have also mentioned that the lights are used to prevent speeders, another plausible possibility. It really depends on your city and the engineers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;aiming to speed you up&quot; is meant within reason. I'm talking about a jam packed 6 lane road where coordinated light cycles can mean the difference between 40km/h and 50km/h. At night, the lights probably ARE optimized to dissuade people from speeding/racing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buses and emergency services usually have preemtion devices to allow them to hold a green or switch to a green (usually respectively. I know that buses where I live aren't able to force a red to a green, but fire trucks can)</p>
</li>
<li>The roadway sensors use magnetic induction to detect when a large chunk of metal is above them, e.g. your car. It's not by weight or pressure, you don't need to hit them exactly or run them over, you just need to get your car near them. The preemption devices mentioned above use special strobe lights (or wireless in higher-tech systems), so flashing your high beams probably isn't gonna do dick, unless you can flash your high beams 20 times per second.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different ways that traffic lights are controlled. In some cases the goal is to create &quot;waves&quot; of traffic that go through multiple green lights. And of course there are detectors that wait for vehicles before they activate - although they always have maximum green and red times. </p>
<p>In this case it may be poor design or it may be part of a bigger traffic plan. It could be they've identified that by slowing traffic down at this point they're able to stop it building up somewhere else. They may have done it for a safety reasons if they identified excess speed as a particular problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually it's because there's a preferred road to travel on and you're not on it. It can be a few main roads that gets all the greens to keep traffic moving and you're crossing them so you get the reds, or increasingly where I live, a toll road that the operators have a contract with the government to direct traffic onto either because its the new main road, or just so the toll road is always faster than the &quot;free&quot; roads.</p>
<p>Other reasons are because of poor planing or the lights run off sensors and aren't coordinated (which amounts to the same thing)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, an ELI5 I feel qualified to answer! I'm a graduate student in transportation! Signal timing is actually a very complicated process, <strong>but it really comes down to the fact that you can't please everyone all the time</strong> (this is the tl;dr of every life problem probably). </p>
<p>Let's illustrate it with a simple example. You want to time three signals, they are split with 30 seconds green and 30 seconds red. If you drive at the speed limit, it takes you 10 seconds to go from the first to the second signal, another 10 seconds to go to the third signal. So how would you time them? Well, it seems easy, set the second signal to start green 10 seconds after the first signal, and the third signal to start green 20 seconds after the second signal. The problem is this only works in one direction! Imagine, now, you want to go in the opposite direction using these timings. If you pass signal 3 when it first shows green, signal 2 will already have been showing green for 10 seconds (20 seconds of green left), and signal 1 will already have been showing green for 20 seconds (only 10 seconds left). Since it takes you 20 seconds to reach signal 1 from signal 3, it's easy to see that someone going in the opposite direction is going to have to stop. Add in cross streets and you've got yourself even more priorities to juggle! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/-/media/Travelandtransport/Roadandtrafficinfo/Traffic-Signals-Information/Figure3.JPG?w=650&amp;h=430&amp;as=1&amp;la=en&amp;hash=8C38C03F431B6B03CBF231DB963781581CBCC1E1" target="_blank">Here's an image I found on Google to illustrate this</a>. In this figure, the green arrows represent the &quot;greenband&quot; (the &quot;window&quot; where arriving vehicles will get green along the whole corridor) for the major direction, and the signal timing is plotted out as horizontal bars. You can see that the opposite direction's &quot;greenband&quot; shown in blue arrows is not as wide, and many vehicles will stop at one of the three lights. </p>
<p>The reality is, transportation systems are designed to minimize the total system delay, which means spreading the delay around such that the total (volume*delay time) is minimized. This means that not-so-busy directions will see red more often, and you may see red at cross streets. Roads where both directions are busy are also really hard to time. Vehicle tracking technologies and things like this are used to adapt the signal timing so that less people have to stop. Usually most cities will time their signals a few times a year based on volume demands, and they may have special timing plans for bad weather (which changes how fast people drive) and special events that add extra demand on certain streets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be poor planning by the city or you could simply be travelling on a less important road than the cross streets whose lights you are getting stopped at.</p>
<p>An example.
I work for an engineering firm that includes highway/street planning and construction division. The highway dept starts 2 desks away from mine. Our office is located next to a very busy city street/limited access highway intersection.</p>
<p>The traffic coming out of my office park and onto the city street is usually crappy and the lights cycle in VERY short cycles. Cars pile up into the office park and citizens are constantly complaining to the city. My company did the design on the intersection when it was upgraded about 3 years ago. The city has asked us to do a traffic study to determine if the street traffic can be reduced or wait times in the intersections reduced.</p>
<p>I was discussing all this with a coworker at lunch just the other day. I asked why the lights were on such short cycle and what could they do about it. The problem as he explained to me was not the city streets but the highway. Because the highway has much higher speeds the potential for deadly crashes is much higher if the exit ramp backs up onto the highway so the timing of the lights is designed to not let the exit ramp fill up. All the other surrounding streets are less important than making sure there are no stopped cars sitting on the highway to get rear ended.</p>
<p>TL:DR maybe your road isn't as important as the other roads</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
