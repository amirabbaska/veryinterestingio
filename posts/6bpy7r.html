<p>Thank you to everyone that responded, there is some very interesting discussion</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>
<p>It's a shame people can't play nice. I am Athiest myself but was merely curious as to the reasoning behind that vow. I think mature discussion can happen between believers and non believers, but it seems not today </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, something I actually have a response for! Someone with 6 years of Jesuit schooling here, and I actually posed this exact question in a Theology class:
The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The concept of marriage in its most basic sense is that you are wedding this person to help them live a better life as their partner. However, since the purpose of heaven is to be infinitely close to God, any bonds or attachments to people you have on Earth are basically null. Your husband/wife would be someone you view fondly and had a close relationship with, but they would no longer be your wife/husband.</p>
<p>I don't really agree with all this, but I'm not going to insert personal opinion here. Hope this explanation helps!</p>
<p>Edit: removed the part saying &quot;The reason for this is explained as 'it would be a distraction from why you're there.'&quot;</p>
<p>/u/_Silly<em>Wizard</em> offered a better explanation, saying that instead of remembering people fondly, it's more akin to everyone is married in the sense that there is perfect unity with God.</p>
<p>Edit 2: figured it would be more credible if I actually included some sources. Here's a passage from the Catechism on the issue:</p>
<p>1618 Christ is the center of all Christian life. The bond with him takes precedence over all other bonds, familial or social.113 From the very beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming.114 Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he remains the model:</p>
<p>&quot;For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.&quot;115</p>
<p>Edit 3: To all the atheists arguing in the comment string below, keep in mind that just because someone is speaking on religious doctrine, it doesn't mean they're trying to 'biblethump' or 'spew nonsense'. Regardless of God's existence, you CANNOT dismiss that faith is historically integrated into culture, and the texts still provide profound lenses through which you can view the world. Stop acting like bloody conspiracy theorists and saying that everyone involved in the church is colluding to create some massive smokescreen. Religion has been around for tens of thousands of years--basically since humans started keeping a written language. And you think that you're some intellectual crusader who's saying &quot;Gods not real bro.&quot; for the first time? Congratulations! There's no God! Now good luck wishing away the millennia of texts, scriptures, parables, and doctrines that he created.</p>
<p>Real? That will always be debated.
Impactful and crucial to understanding western civilization? Abso-fuckin'-lutely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, everyone has given a religious reason from a passage of Scripture about Jesus's comments on the afterlife (an answer to a trick question he was asked by some Sadducees, members of a Jewish sect that didn't believe in an afterlife).</p>
<p>But that's not the real reason for the wording of the marriage vows. It has to do with the fact that you are free to remarry if your spouse dies.</p>
<p>The exact wording of the vow varies according to the denomination, but here's one version used by the United Methodist Church (in the form of a question from the pastor to the couple):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you have this woman/man to be your wife/husband, to live together in holy marriage? Will you love her/him, comfort her/him, honor, and keep her/him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, be faithful to her/him as long as you both shall live?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from the context, it's all about living together with your spouse and being faithful to them; but obviously, that only applies if you're both still alive. If you die, your spouse can hardly &quot;comfort&quot; you, or &quot;keep&quot; you &quot;in sickness and in health&quot; -- how would that even work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, in the Bible there was a similar question posed to Jesus himself. Some of the religious leaders of the Jewish community at the time asked Jesus if a woman had 7 husbands that all died before she did, who would be her husband in heaven. Jesus' response (boiled down) was that we would be &quot;like the angels.&quot; Though there is debate as to what that actually means, the implication is that we would have no relationships like that in heaven and that we would only he interested in our worship of God. The passage is Luke 20: 27-40 if you're interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised (unless I missed it) no one pointed out the purely pragmatic reason for &quot;'til death do us part&quot;: until recently, death at young age was common, so the vows needed to clarify that the surviving spouse can remarry, have kids with a new spouse, etc. So a more precise if inelegant vow would thus be &quot;'til the death of one of us parts us, at which point the survivor may remarry.&quot;</p>
<p>Point being, the clause isn't a theological one about &quot;when you die, you're no longer married&quot; but rather a pragmatic one about &quot;when one of you dies, the other may remarry.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe that marriages performed in the temple do transcend this life. This is made possible by the sealing keys. For example, when Jesus gave these keys to the apostles he said &quot;whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot; (Matt 18:18 KJV) </p>
<p>In lieu of the words &quot;Til death us do part&quot; we opt for the phrase &quot;For time and all eternity&quot; in Temple marriages. </p>
<p>That being said, many Christian religions do not believe in marriage after this life because of Matt 22:23-30. In these verses the Sadducees (who don't believe in the resurrection) are trying to bait Jesus by asking him a question about a woman who has been married 7 times, to 7 brothers . They ask which of the brothers shall be her husband in the afterlife, to which Jesus responds, &quot;Ye do err... for in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>He is not directly answering their question, but explains that they do not understand the question themselves (Matt 22:29-33). Still many people get caught up on the line about not being given in marriage during the resurrection. So it really comes down to this: did Jesus mean what he said literally and does it apply to all marriages? Or did he give an oversimplified answer to men who were not ready or willing to listen? This is still being debated by many Christian scholars. </p>
<p>Edit1: grammar </p>
<p>Edit2: Matt 16:19 is the verse where Jesus gives the keys specifically to the apostle John. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
