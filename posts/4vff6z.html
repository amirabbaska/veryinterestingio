		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroococcidiopsis" target="_blank">Chroococcidiopsis</a> comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to its resistance to harsh environmental conditions, especially low temperature, low moisture, and radiation tolerance, Chroococcidiopsis has been thought of as an organism capable of living on Mars. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As other commenters have said, the lack of water on Mars would probably prevent these guys from growing on their own. But with a little human intervention, they may be able to grow in Martian soil and help with the terraforming process (assuming we ever terraform Mars). </p>
<p>Edit: for anyone interested in a great vision of colonizing and terraforming Mars, I highly recommend the Mars trilogy (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars) by Kim Stanley Robinson!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What I don't know is if they tested for Martian radiation levels, or if radiation is even a significant factor at the depths in question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually do life detection research for potential future Mars missions in graduate school. Terrestrial life in the Atacama desert is our best analog for life that could survive on Mars. My favorite example is halophilic, endolithic organisms (life that likes salt and lives in rocks). There are salt crystals in the desert that deliquesce (pull enough water out of the air to dissolve in it and become liquid) and we have found microbes that live in this salty brine. There are seasonally changing features on the Martian surface called RSL that a lot of scientists think are periodicity recurring, really briny water tracks that happen in the summer by salts deliquescing water out the atmosphere. If a terrestrial, halophilic organism got to an RSL, it is conceivable that there would be seasonal blooms of them during which they thrive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
