		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Accelerometer in your phone detects the slight fall and stop that occurs each time you step down. It counts each time this happens as your steps. The phone also uses location services when available to be more accurate. Finally, as you use it more, it learns a little better what it should count and what it shouldn't as steps, so usually it'll get more accurate after a few months of being in your pocket. I credit magic with the last part, but it's probably some kind of AI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your phone has, among tons of other gadgets and sensors, what’s called an accelerometer which tracks motion, tracks your acceleration, and also tracks which way the phone is pointing. This helps it do things like count the steps you take, as well as show which way you’re facing (in apps like Google Maps for example, an arrow will point in the direction you’re facing - that’s the accelerometer at work).</p>
<p>For more info, Gizmodo has <a href="https://gizmodo.com/all-the-sensors-in-your-smartphone-and-how-they-work-1797121002" target="_blank">a great article</a> that talks about all the sensors in your phone. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The more you walk the more it's movement sensors becomes acoustomed to your average gait which it then couples with location services (if available) to give you an incredibly accurate estimation of how many steps you've taken </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your phone has many sensors inside, that measure all kinds of data like acceleration, orientation, position, the magnetic field, air pressure, and radio waves. individually it can be hard to interpret this data as you move around and do various activities all day.</p>
<p>Your phone runs a complex algorithm that tries to answer a bunch of questions from all this data at the same time rather than any one of the data streams individually. Most importantly it tries to figure out where you are how fast you are moving and in which direction that movement is.</p>
<p>Another algorithm takes this answer together with the raw data and tries to guess how you are moving. Are you walking? Are you running, are you driving a car etc,</p>
<p>Once that has been decided another algorithm updates things like step counters. Apple/Samsung etc gathers lots of example of each way of moving, so say for example a video of someone walking while holding a phone in their hand, walking with the phone in their pocket, running with the phone in an armband etc and actually counts the steps manually. They then try to program this algorithm to be able to match this calibration data. Each type of motion has a distinct pattern or signature that can be recognized very similarly to how something like voice recognition or speech to text works.</p>
<p>Most of this algorithm runs in a dedicated chip called the motion coprocessor which is a special low energy processor that runs only these algorithms continually in the background so it doesn't miss any movement but also doesn't use too much battery power. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
