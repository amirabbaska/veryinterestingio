<p>Interestingly most of this land the government will sell you for dirt cheap. So you could purchase it and live off the grid, but that is a very hard way to live. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I believe its typically called homestead claims or something of that sort if you want to google more info.</p>
<p>This land is <em>super</em> out there, no practical value, would be hard to get utility hookups ect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends a lot on the legislation. If nobody else have claims on a land then the government have ownership over it. There are of course a lot of cases in Europe where land rights are determined by a lot of documents that may predate most of the laws. In these cases who &quot;owns&quot; it is a strange question as ownership does not apply in the modern sense of the word. In addition a lot of land is owned by farmers, investors and nobles. If you were to go off into the mountains and build a home then you would need permission from the owner. Which in the case it is a set of legal documents might be difficult. You might also need permission from the local government. There are various planning commissions and laws about preserving nature and the view so you might not be allowed to set up a house anywhere you want. And even if you are able to build a house and go off grid you still have to follow the law which does include several obligations. If the law say you need to send your kids to school then you need to send your kids to school. If the law say you need a birth certificate for your kids then you need a birth certificate for your kids. If the law say you need to pay taxes then you need to pay taxes. Even if you grow your own food and create your own electricity then that may or may not be taxable. So in the end it is very hard to go completely off the grid. However you can go pretty far in some places and may only talk to someone else once a year or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Land in the US is owned by private citizens, companies, City governments, County Governments, State Governments, and the Federal Government. </p>
<p>The land you talk about is most likely to be owned by the Federal Government or State Government. It is illegal for you to build on it without buying it, but if the land is not a part of a State or National Park odds are that you can buy it and then live off the grid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think every bit of land in all 50 states is owned by someone.   Either private owners, the federal government, or state or local governments.   </p>
<p>Is there a lot of undeveloped land?   Yes.</p>
<p>Could you go far enough away from civilization that no one would care?   Probably.</p>
<p>If the owner found you living on his land illegally, would he care?   Maybe yes, maybe no.  No way to tell.</p>
<p>But it would suck to go to the back woods of Montana, build yourself a nice farm, log cabin, and all that, then one day you come back from hunting elk or whatever and some bulldozer from a logging company has bashed it all down to make a logging road.   What would you do then?   You'd be stuck in the middle of nowhere with no food, or shelter, communications or transportation.   You'd end up dead probably, and that's REALLY no fun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
