		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time lurker, first time poster. Trade economist. I'll try to keep this ELI5 as much as a discussion of a free trade agreement can be...</p>
<p>The short answer to your question is a combination of &quot;not a whole lot&quot; and &quot;we dont know.&quot;</p>
<p>As several other comments have noted, trade agreements are traditionally about lowering tariffs (lowering the tax on avocados imported from Chile, for example). Historically, tariffs were very high because governments all sought to protect their domestic markets and the jobs associated with those industries.</p>
<p>After World War II and with the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), countries began to engage in reciprocal tariff cuts via so-called &quot;rounds&quot; of negotiations. The key point here is that an international organization (the GATT) served as a forum where countries could engage in negotiations in which both sides agreed to cut tariffs proportionally. The Geneva Round, the Kennedy Round, and the Tokyo Round all cut tariffs by 25+%, meaning that by the time the World Trade Organization (the successor to the GATT) was created at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1995, there were relatively few tariffs left to cut.</p>
<p>Because tariffs are low, the negotiating agenda at the international level has expanded to include more contentious issues. For example, Japan is phenomenally inefficient at producing rice, yet it insists on protecting its domestic rice farmers because they are a politically powerful lobby (and it maintains an absurd tariff, above 500% on imports of rice, as a result). Because of this, they insist that any future agreement does not touch that part of their agriculture sector, much to the annoyance of their rice-producing neighbors. The US is similarly inefficient at producing cotton and lost a dispute at the WTO several years ago in which Brazil claimed US subsidies and protections for domestic cotton producers violated US WTO commitments. The US lost, but rather than change its policies it chose to pay Brazil nearly $150 million per year to continue subsidizing US cotton farmers. This is the short version of both stories, there is more nuance to be added, but you get the drift... Agriculture is just one example of how negotiations have begun to address more contentious topics. The WTO has also opened negotiations on intellectual property (TRIPS), investment (TRIMS) and services (GATS), among other issues. All that to say, international trade negotiations have begun to get harder over time. In essence, they are a victim of their own success. The low-hanging fruit has been picked.</p>
<p>As trade negotiations have gotten more contentious internationally, the agenda has stalled. This is due to a variety of factors, but the main point is that the result of this international stagnation has been countries engaging in what are called Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). PTAs are agreements between one country (or more) with another country (or more), rather than all members of the GATT/WTO agreeing to cut tariffs. For example, the EU is just finishing an agreement with Canada right now and the US inked deals with Colombia, Panama and South Korea a few years ago. There have been literally hundreds signed in the last 20 years, driven largely by the stalled agenda at the WTO level. The TPP (I know, it took me a while to get here) is one of these agreements.</p>
<p>So, what do these PTAs (like the TPP) mean for you and what do they do? As I said at the beginning, &quot;not a whole lot&quot; and &quot;we dont know.&quot; On balance, the TPP is neither as bad as its detractors suggest nor as good as its proponents contend. It will likely have a moderately positive net impact on economic growth in the US and partner countries (<a href="http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb12-16.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb12-16.pdf</a>) but, like all previous trade agreements, jobs will be both destroyed and created. It is useful to think about trade agreements as a sort of technological shift: in the same way that ATMs destroyed certain jobs in the economy, so too will trade agreements. The benefits (small or large) will be felt in the long term while the pain will be felt in the short term.</p>
<p>The TPP covers a huge number of issues. Goods, services, rules of origin, labor, environment, government procurement, and intellectual property, among many others. It is unlikely that any of these issues will mean anything for you in your daily life, but the importance is broader: this agreement is big and it covers several of the world's largest economies in one of its most important regions. China is negotiating an alternative agreement (the RTAA) and the failure of the TPP would mean that the standards the US hopes to hold the partner countries to would not be met and would in fact be supplanted by the standards that China wants. US policymakers do not want this, for obvious reasons, and arguably it is better to have agreements that include higher (if imperfect) standards than a. no agreement or b. a China-led agreement (given its history on human rights, intellectual property etc.)</p>
<p>This is an enormously complicated topic that is easy to demagogue. People love to shout about secrecy, currency manipulation, corporate takeover etc. As a skeptic who works in this world, I can assure you the doomsayers are wrong (but so too are the optimists).</p>
<p>TL;DR - the TPP does a lot, but none of it matters to your daily life and the people who claim it does (for good or ill) are peddling their own agenda. On balance, it seems better to have the TPP than to have the alternative: no agreement or a low-standards agreement negotiated by China.</p>
<p>EDIT - Thanks for the gold. Also, thanks for the encouraging comments. And to the angry folks blowing up my inbox, let me just say again: the TPP is neither as good nor as bad as you read. Sending me articles from the EFF and Public Citizen about the evils of the TPP is equivalent to citing a study from WalMart or JP Morgan Chase about how great the TPP is. The truth (what we can know of it at this point) is just more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A selection of other TPP and TTIP articles and information are listed below. Basically everyone, from both the left and the right, who isn't in the pay of the big banks, big pharma, big oil and Monsanto etc. very strongly opposes these deals, because they are very bad news for over 99% of ordinary people.</p>
<p>People who openly and strongly oppose these deals include Joseph Stiglitz, Robert Reich, Noam Chomsky, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pat Buchanan and Paul Craig Roberts.</p>
<p>Robert Reich is very strongly against TPP (the same reasons also apply to TTIP in Europe) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8osDtyKt0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8osDtyKt0</a></p>
<p>Bernie Sanders has written a very strongly worded statement condemning these deals, which I would recommend everybody read <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file" target="_blank">http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file</a></p>

<p>“The corporations have bribed the political leaders in every country to sign away their sovereignty and the general welfare of their people to private corporations. Corporations have paid US senators large sums for transferring Congress’ law-making powers to corporations.” – Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary to US Treasury, former editor of the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>Rule By the Corporations - TTIP: The Corporate Empowerment Act <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/06/01/rule-corporations-paul-craig-roberts-3/" target="_blank">http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/06/01/rule-corporations-paul-craig-roberts-3/</a></p>
<p>Geraint Davies (UK MP) “The harsh reality is that this deal is being stitched up behind closed doors by negotiators, with the influence of big corporations and the dark arts of corporate lawyers. They are stitching up rules that would be outside contract law and common law, and outside the shining light of democracy, to give powers to multinationals to sue Governments over laws that were designed to protect their citizens.”</p>
<p>Caroline Lucas (UK MP) pointed out in support of this that “the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, who are in trade agreements that include this kind of investor-state relationship, have been sued 127 times and have lost an amount of money that could have employed 300,000 nurses for a year“.</p>
<p>UKIP oppose TTIP because it is NOT a free trade deal. It's a Corporate power grab dressed up as a trade deal.</p>

<p>The purpose of Fast Track is a) to remove the Constitutional requirement for a two thirds majority (which is otherwise required for a treaty or international agreement) and b) to prevent any amendments to the deals being allowed or proposed. It becomes a simple up or down vote.</p>
<p>The reason for the draconian efforts to keep the texts of the deals a secret up until now is to enable Fast Track to be passed without a riot on the streets. It won't really matter after Fast Track is approved. It will be very hard stopping them getting approved (in the US).</p>
<p>These Corporate Power Grab deals transfer Sovereignty to Corporations. They will only benefit the top 0.1% - the major owners and boards of large Corporations. They are dressed up as &quot;free trade&quot; deals in order to get them to pass. They will lose well paid jobs, increase unemployment, depress wages, increase poverty, increase pollution and jack up the price of prescription drugs. They basically screw both your health and your wealth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://economixcomix.com/home/tpp/" target="_blank">This comic explains things very well</a>. </p>
<p>Short short version:</p>
<p>&quot;Free Trade&quot; treaties like this have been around for a long time. The problem is, the United States, and indeed most of the world, has had practically free trade since the 50s. What these new treaties do is allow corporations to manipulate currency and stock markets, to trade goods for capital, resulting in money moving out of an economy never to return, and override the governments of nations that they operate in because they don't like policy. </p>
<p>For example, Australia currently has a similar treaty with Hong Kong. They recently passed a &quot;plain packaging&quot; law for cigarettes, they cannot advertise to children anymore. The cigarette companies don't like this, so they went to a court in Hong Kong, and they <em>sued Australia</em> for breaking international law by making their advertising tactics illegal. This treaty has caused Australia to give up their sovereignty to mega-corporations. </p>
<p>Another thing these treaties do is allow companies to relocate whenever they like. This means that, when taxes are going to be raised, corporations can just get up and leave, which means less jobs, and even less revenue for the government. </p>
<p>The TPP has some particularly egregious clauses concerning intellectual property. It requires that signatory companies grant patents on things like living things that should not be patentable, and not deny patents based on evidence that the invention is not new or revolutionary. In other words, if the TPP was in force eight years ago, Apple would have gotten the patent they requested on rectangles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the very very very few things most economists agree on (perhaps the only thing other than supply and demand) is that free trade <em>in goods</em> is generally good for the growth of an economy (evidence and opinions are more mixed on financial liberalization). There are obviously some people that disagree, but in general, that consensus is so strong that it even pervades politics. No government likes being called a 'protectionist' (ie someone who protects their home industries from foreign competition somehow) or 'beggaring their neighbor' with targeted protectionism. The taxes (tariffs) it costs to sell your good in another country have come from some crazy numbers like 150% in India (or more realistically, even 30% in USA a few decades ago) to the point that even China only has an 8% tariff on most goods (although large protected industries remain in many countries). Less market distortions help allocate goods efficiently or so the theory goes. So trade policy on (most) physical goods is hyper-liberal. </p>
<p>As the developed world stopped being the world's factory, and became the world's consultant/banker/programmer, the trade openness in physical goods became less important than opening developing markets to 'services' companies. But what does that look like? No lawyer is going to commute from New York to Beijing just because tariffs come down. Also, most law firms, consultancies or banks expand via acquisition, not by building their own operations in a new market. So free trade in services came to mean legal openness to foreign acquisition or foreign ownership of a local subsidiary. Hence why the new trade deals are more about rights of foreign corporations than about further reductions in tariffs. Its the new frontier in trade openness. </p>
<p>Will these deals lead to the same efficiency gains as trade in goods? Who knows, probably not. Its providing slightly more certainty to foreign investors which may help. Was this agenda set with input from corporations? Definitely. Does anyone honestly believe that a company could force a country, <em>via the WTO</em>, to do anything they didn't want to do? Doubt it. What does it mean for you? Effectively nothing unless you run an accountant firm looking to expand in Malaysia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>A big issue with the TPPA is how it targets healthcare in other countries. As it stands now, it has the ability to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851013002108" target="_blank">undermine free healthcare systems</a> such as the NHS in the UK or PHARMAC in NZ.</strong> </p>
<p>From my understanding of it, Essentially the big driving force behind the TPPA has been from pharmaceutical companies attempting the get the rest of the world to pay US prices for their products. Currently the US is in an upward cost spiral where Insurance companies and pharmacies are inflating prices. I beleive it was explained well in another thread (but I can't find it now). A product that costs $20 would usually be sold for $30 and the pharmacy would make a $10 profit. But insurance companies will only pay 20-30% of the price in some instances, so the pharmacies end up having to charge $150 to get that same $10 profit. But insurance companies don't like being ripped off, so that $150 price is also charged to customers just buying the product out of pocket. The TPPA intends to extend that pricing system to countries such as Britain and NZ where they have price controls in place.</p>
<p>For example, New Zealand's Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC) currently buys all of NZ's medicines at a discounted bulk price on behalf of NZ citizens, as well as setting price limits on some medication to ensure it remains affortable. If the TPPA passed as it is now, it would make this practice illegal. </p>
<p>Originally the US government had the balls to say &quot;Get rid of your healthcare programs or we won't sign a trade agreement with you.&quot; Now they are just trying to sneak it in there.
