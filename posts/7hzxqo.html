How are they able to do this?  I would think the number of variables (not limited to: wind speed and direction over the entire course of the fire, topography, combustible material composition, etc.) would be so large that trying to trace back to the initial source would be next to impossible.  Can anyone clue me in with how they are able to do this?</p></div></div>

<p>There are a LOT of methods used, and it's hard to exactly answer. Every case is different in terms of exactly what evidence can lead to a definitive source, and sometimes it may be a quick conclusion based on something simple or sometimes it can be impossible to tell. Investigators follow a series of rather rigorous tests and have some extensive background training on fire cause, spread, patterns, and all the many variables that go into a particular kind of fire. Sometimes it <em>is</em> impossible, but other times a lot of those confounding factors can be eliminated based on other factors that are less apparent to a layman. </p>
<p>I don't know the likelihood that we have some actual certified Fire Investigators lurking, but I'd love to hear some of their specific tools and methods used in such a special case as wildfires. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a fire investigator, I’ve never done a wildfire investigation but the standard most investigators are NFPA 1033 certified. In being certified you would follow the principles in NFPA 921 - guide for fire and explosion investigations.
You pretty much just use the scientific method. 921 has a chapter (28) dedicated to wild land investigations.
It’s not as technical as you see on TV. Detailed data collection is key, understanding fuel loads, burn patterns and how wind and topography effect fires.
Like I said I’ve never done one but it has to be easier than digging out a burnt down house.  I’d assume the country side would be just one big burn pattern that you could follow back to the source(with knowledge of weather and topography). </p>
<p>NFPA 921 is free to view online you have to register but it’s free and they don’t spam. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Origin and cause of wildfire, like some others have mentioned is guided by the NFPA guidelines which to  the layperson can be summarized (as has been mentioned) as “use the scientific method.”   There is no magic, but rather a rigorous use of common sense, logic, experience (based on science), and investigation skills.</p>
<p>A large fire was once a small fire. Go to first reports, first video, first in suppression teams, and find out where the fire was burning early on. </p>
<p>Consider all sources of ignition, from arson, lightening, welding, shooting, campfires, and on and on....</p>
<p>Look in the area where the fire was known to have started.   Consider wind. Consider terrain, consider fuel load. </p>
<p>Look at indicators. If dry grass burns from one location to the other, which way do the grass blades fall?  They fall towards the fire. Imagine grass burning to embers up against dry grass that hasn’t yet burned.  The blades are compromised by fire, and fall... but they fall towards the area that has already burned because there isn’t grass to support them. </p>
<p>There are other signs. Thicker sticks and wood will show heavier charring on the side where the fire came from, rather than where it was going. </p>
<p>Colored flags (like surveyors flags) can be used to mark sign. </p>
<p>There are always exceptions.  Bigger patterns in sign point the right direction.  </p>
<p>Arrive at area of origin where signs, evidence, statements... all align.  Look there for evidence of cause.   </p>
<p>Sometimes it’s easy as pie.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it’s a mystery. </p>
<p>Easy example:  campfire, arson device, welding rig.</p>
<p>Mystery example:  nothing to find at area of origin.  An arsonist igniting the fire with an open flame (like a lighter) and walking away. </p>
<p>This is drastically oversimplified, but this is basically it. </p>
<p>Source:  I have investigated fires professionally, testified as an expert, and sent people to prison for arson. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
