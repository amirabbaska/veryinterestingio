		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At a simple level electronics are long lists of directions that can change with different inputs.  Just like when you get lost it can be worth retracing your steps to the beginning, sometimes the electronics get lost on a set of directions that don't recognize the right input to get back to the step you want.    </p>
<p>Rebooting them starts the chain of directions from the beginning (which are often the most stable directions in the system).  It works on all devices because they're all doing the same thing, following a set of directions designed when they were being created.  </p>
<p>The time matters because devices have capacitors (similar to buckets of electrons) and to ensure you actually start all the directions from the top you want to wait until all the buckets are empty otherwise partially full ones might not stop following the broken branch direction.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike many of the questions on this sub, this one actually lends itself to ELI5 instead of ELI15. Most of the answers so far have been ELI15, so let me try ELI5.</p>
<p>Your electronics are normally pretty good at doing their job. If they're misbehaving, it's usually because they're confused about something. When you turn an electronic device off, it forgets about whatever it was it was confused about. When you turn it on again, it just gets back to doing its job, which it knows how to do pretty well.</p>
<p>It does matter how long you turn an electronic device off for, because if you don't turn it off for long enough, it might not forget about what was confusing it. If that's the case, when you turn it on again, it'll still be confused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a computer like a chalkboard; you can write things, but it takes up space. You can erase things, but you always get this leftover chalk dust.</p>
<p>Keep this up long enough, and the color of the board is significantly lighter and you can barely read what you do write on it.</p>
<p>So you take a washcloth to the chalkboard to remove all the chalk dust and start fresh, and the chalkboard works better.</p>
<p>Same basic principle with rebooting a computer: Sometimes programs keep running after a fault and leave garbage in your RAM and other places, or just don't unload everything properly; sometimes a windows service in the background stops and can't restart with everything that's going on in the system. So by turning it off you force everything out of RAM, then on startup you load in the bits that run just the base operating system without any excess clutter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is returning them to a known-good state. By allowing capacitors to drain and clearing volatile memory the device can be started from a configuration which has been tested to work, compared to whatever state it might have been put into where it ran into trouble.</p>
<p>How long it needs to be left off depends on the device, but usually 30 seconds is plenty of time for capacitors to drain and memory is usually reset within moments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
