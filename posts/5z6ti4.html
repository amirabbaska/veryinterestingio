		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tulip
Shape: Bulb that tapers in before flaring out at the top.
Purported Benefits: concentration of aroma, support of the foamy head at the top, and comfortable drinking afforded by flared rim.</p>
<p>Chalice
Shape: A round bowl on a stem.
Purported Benefits: Beautiful presentation, foam support, wide mouth for easy drinkin' (in big sips.)</p>
<p>Pilsner
Shape: Tall, footed, slender, tapered out from the bottom. 
Purported Benefits: Displays the beer's clarity, while tapered shape supports head.</p>
<p>Weizen
Shape: Tall, large, slender at bottom, bowled out a bit at the top.
Purported Benefits: Large size accommodates a massive, frothy head associated with highly-carbonated German wheat beers. Slender bottom shows off these beers' famous hazy color and protects its lively carbonation.</p>
<p>Nonick Imperial Pint
Shape: Large, slightly tapered out with bulge near top.
Purported benefits: Designed for the no-nonsense drinker. The bulge facilitates stacking and prevents rim chipping.</p>
<p>Shaker Pint
Shape: Slight taper outward from bottom.
Purported benefits: Cheap and easily stackable. Sturdy ones can be used for stirring and shaking cocktails.</p>
<p>Snifter
Shape: Stemmed, wide-bowled, tapered in at top.
Purported benefits: Designed for maximum concentration of volatile organic compounds—that is, aroma.</p>
<p>Tumbler
Shape: Short and squat with thick glass and a slight outward taper.
Purported Benefits: Tradition generally drives the use of this glass, which is usually reserved for Belgian witbier and lambic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the glass affects how your mouth and nose (eyes to an extent) interact with the beverage. A very wide glass will allow your whole nose to enter the glass as you sip it, the aroma adds to and complements the taste. A very narrow glass like a champagne flute reduces surface area which keeps the bubbly bubbles from gassing out before you can drink it. Other glasses like a Brandy snifter allow to you swirl the beverage without spilling it, the swirling allows the aroma to release but the narrow lip of the glass traps most of it in the glass, so you can get your nose right in there. Some glasses have stems to keep your body heat out of the beverages while other glasses encourage the handling to warm the drink inside. Certain beer glasses have wider tops which allows the head to form and remain which contributes to aroma and protects the beer below from reacting with the oxygen in the air. Beer stiens have a handle so the beer stays cold. There's are many more examples but this covers some basic reasons for shapes. As an experiment try your favourite drink in various glasses and see if you notice the subtle effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until a better answer comes along:</p>
<p>Some glassware has different openings, exposing the beverage to more or less air. Taste is related to smell, so a glass that has room for your nose will allow you to 'experience' more of the drink. In beer glasses, some shapes allow for more foam (or head), and that is often part of the taste of the beer (like Guinness or Boddingtons). Different shapes also have different surface areas. Red wine glasses have more surface area because the wine is meant to be tasted at room temp, white wine has less surface area to help keep the wine chilled. Glassware that has stems (like wine and martini) is so the temperature of your hand doesn't change the temp of the drink. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a wine class in college and a sommelier came as a guest speaker and his answer to this question was: You're favorite wine will taste best in your favorite type of glass.</p>
<p>That there was no right or wrong, suggesting how wine as a whole is just the experience you make it. All &quot;science&quot; and snooty sommelier-ness aside. I thought it was pretty cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>90% of the mythology is hype, put out by glassmakers to sell more glasses to people who already have too many.</p>
<p>I use a plain stemmed Bordeaux wineglass, big enough for me to get my nose into, for whatever wine I'm drinking, or even for beer.</p>
<p>I just don't want a 'stemless' glass, where the heat of my hand warms the wine, and the glass gets greasy from food if any finger food is involved.</p>
<p>And I don't want a deep curve in the glass, where I have to crack my neck backwards trying to get the last drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
