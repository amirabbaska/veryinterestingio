		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From your point of view, the guy on the spaceship shining the torch, nothing would change. It would look exactly like it would if you shone it when you weren't moving at all. One of the fundamental axioms of relativity is that nothing changes when you move, we phrase this as 'all inertial frames are equivalent'. This means if an experiment, such as measuring the colour of a flashlight, has a result when you are stationary, it has the same result when moving.</p>
<p>The interesting results from relativity come from other observers who do not share your speed.</p>
<p>Someone who was in front of you would see the flashlight be blueshifted whereas someone behind you would see the light from the flashlight redshifted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably late to the party, but here are the actual numbers.</p>
<p>Like people said before, in the spaceship nothing would change. So let's shine the light outside the ship.</p>
<p>This is what's known as the Relativistic Doppler Effect. The equation is wavelength2=wavelength1*sqrt(1+v/c)/sqrt(1-v/c). Velocity is positive if moving away from an observer, negative if moving towards an observer.</p>
<p>Let's say green light was a wavelength of 530 nm.</p>
<p>Moving away at 0.5c, the observer would see it redshifted to 918 nm. This is infrared light, so they wouldn't actually be able to see it without some kind of instrument.</p>
<p>Moving toward an observer at 0.5c, the observer would see it blueshifted to 306 nm. So again it's not visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Edit: Clarification: 306 nm is not visible because it's in the ultraviolet range.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll just mention that adding velocities doesn't quite work the way people think it does. The equation is w = (u + v) / (1 + (uv) / c^2 ). So, for small velocities, c^2 is so big, that the denominator is one, and it's basically w = u + v. Things get interesting with higher velocities.  For u = v = c, w will be... c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole point of relativity is that speed is relative. There is no such thing as a spaceship going at 0.5 c. If the spaceship is going at 0.5c <em>compared to earth</em>, you can have relativity-related phenomena between earth and the spaceship. If the spaceship is alone in space, everything is happening as if it wasn't moving, because it <em>is</em> not moving.</p>
<p>Note that this is only true about speed. If the spaceship is accelerating, it will experience effects even by itself alone in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you're on the spaceship with the flashlight, the light is going to look green to you no matter which way you point it.</p>
<p>The color only changes for someone <em>outside</em> your spaceship who is not traveling along with you. Let's say you're traveling from Earth to Mars. If you shone the flashlight backwards, someone on Earth would see a red light (or rather, redder than it appears to you). If you shone the flashlight forwards, someone on Mars would see a blue light (or at least, bluer than it appears to you).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
