		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The keys that we use in Western music are based around the major scale, a fixed pattern of whole steps and half steps (WWHWWWH).</p>
<p>If you play this pattern starting on the note C, you get all of the natural notes -- no sharps, no flats.  Thus our key of C major also has no sharps or flats.</p>
<p>Now you move up a fifth from C to G.  Play that same pattern of whole steps and half steps starting on G, and you get all natural notes except for F#.  That's our key of G, with just F# in the key signature.</p>
<p>Move up another fifth to D, play the same pattern and it now has F# and C#.  Two sharps in the key signature.</p>
<p>This continues on: every time you move up a fifth, it adds one sharp into the key signature.  It also works going down: a fifth down from C is F -- play the pattern and this time you get one flat: Bb.  Down a fifth from F to Bb, you get two flats, and so on.</p>
<p>What this all is to say is that we have a predictable pattern of the notes in a major key simply based on this pattern of moving a fifth, adding a sharp or flat.  We call it a circle because visually it loops around: you eventually get to F# (key signature with six sharps) which is the same pitch as Gb (key signature with six flats), allowing you to simply flip which side you're on and circle back around to C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I can answer, Basically there are 12 possible starting point before they repeat in a higher or lower octave. Scales are just patterns (previously mentioned WWHWWWH is Major scales, although the circle doesn’t care if major or minor or any other western mode) and the circle is a way to categorize those patterns relative to each other. Moving clockwise the next scale begins from the fifth scale degree (fifth note in the scale) counter clock wise starts from the fourth. </p>
<p>It’s entirely possible for a scale to have 11 sharps even though there are only seven notes but because it sounds the same as another scale it’s easier to just use the same key signature as something within the 12... unless you jazz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a chainsaw. </p>
<p>With variable speed control.</p>
<p>As you cut into your music teacher's desk, 200 teeth chew at the wood per second emitting a pitch - your &quot;base&quot; note.</p>
<p>Now pick up speed so 300 teeth per second chew into that desk. The pitch rises higher and higher till you get to a second note. The first note to second note interval is called a &quot;perfect 5th&quot;, and sounds like the interval between the first and second &quot;twinkle&quot; in  &quot;twinkle, twinkle little star&quot;.</p>
<p>(A perfect fifth is the musical interval corresponding to a pair of pitches with a frequency ratio of 2:3.)</p>
<p>Now take this top note of 300 and make that the new bottom note. Pick up speed to 450 teeth per second. That's another perfect 5th. </p>
<p>Do it again, and again, cutting up all the chairs and tables in the school music room, going up by 2:3 ratio each time. The chainsaw is revving really high now and dogs in the neighbourhood are howling in pain. If it goes beyond your hearing range - or simply whenever you like - you can always normalise a pitch by halving it's frequency bringing it down an octave (a 200 is good as a 400 or 800).</p>
<p>So you keep doing this...halving occasionally to lower a high note into the same octave interval...and eventually - <em>you arrive back at the note you started!</em> (Thus &quot;completing the circle&quot;). Assuming a well tempered chainsaw, you get all the 12 notes/division within the octave you see on the piano or the frets of a guitar!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add another point which I haven't seen mentioned in the other comments.</p>
<p>The circie of fifths can be used to create a powerful chord progression. Often, this might be a circle of fourths (which is just an inverted circle of fifths).</p>
<p>For instance, a strong progression could be:</p>
<p>Cmaj, Fmaj, Bdim, E7, Amin, Dmin, G7, Cmaj</p>
<p>Each root of the next chord in the series is a fourth away from the other (or an inverted fifth).</p>
<p>Even the most common progression in jazz, ii V I, is following this pattern at its end (see Dmin, G7, and Cmaj).</p>
<p>Another person here hit a point about how the key signatures vary only slightly going along the circle. For instance, C major has no sharps or flats. G major has 1 sharp. For these reasons, it is easier to modulate (or change keys during the music) to keys that are a fourth or fifth away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
