		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If this measurement of 1 billion years turns out to be true and is the same for all galaxies, then it is significant because if we know the speed of the rotation, then we can measure a lot of other things about the galaxies- their masses especially. The equations for how this works would be out of the ELI5 boards, but they are connected.</p>
<p>Also- if one billion years -per-rotation is the speed, it leads us to more questions. !!And this is how science works- solving problems and finding new questions!!
-Why is it 1B years?
-Are they the same direction?
-Are bigger galaxies necessarily older because of what this new data states?
-Does this change when two disc galaxies merge? And does this shine any light on non- disc galaxies?
-And the black holes at the centers of many galaxies spin- does this mean the spin gets faster, slower or doesn’t change when the stars are swallowed up into the black hole since the mass of the stars just become added to the mass of the black hole?</p>
<p>Also by knowing the speed and mass we can begin to measure the amount of energy making the galaxy spin- which could lead to identifying more information about the black hole. </p>
<p>And once know about the mass and energy we can study the effects of the galaxy on it’s neighboring galaxies or giant dust clouds. And so on.
It’s science! And it’s always so exciting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a general point of view, anytime we see something occurring in all examples of something, it's significant.</p>
<p>Planets and stars are round(ish) because of how gravity shapes non solid masses into that shape. There's no pyramid shaped planets running around barring post cooling impacts.</p>
<p>So if we observe all galaxies rotating at a consistent rate, we can extrapolate that <em>something</em> is making that happen. And since galaxies have formed at varying times and in varying circumstances, we can rule out some inherited property from a singular event.</p>
<p>Perhaps galaxies are only stable under certain conditions, with tendencies to collapse in or fall apart if the circumstances which generate them are outside of a relatively narrow range that also happens to result in galaxies that revolve at a specific speed. Perhaps not. Probably not.</p>
<p>We don't know yet. We just know it's a significant detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally, Newtonian physics say with the same energy the smaller the object the faster it rotates, the bigger the slower it rotates. But if all galaxies, big and small rotate at the same speed it means that they must either follow different rules, or there is something to them that we don't know yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

How does that fit into this new discovery? Was the 300mio estimate just completly off the mark?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
