		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, to fire a gun there is a firing pin, which you can see in <a href="https://www.saratogaweapons.com/Rob/gifs/bullet-animation.gif" target="_blank">this gif</a> striking the back of a cartridge, igniting the powder and firing the gun.  <em>Most</em> cartridges are center fire, with a primer in the middle (the silvery middle part of the back of a cartridge) but some are rim fire.  <a href="http://info.blackstoneshooting.com/hubfs/rim-center-1.jpg" target="_blank">Here is an illustration of the difference</a>, and <a href="http://www.pewpewtactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rimfire-vs-Centerfire-Firing-Pin-Marks.jpg" target="_blank">here is a picture of the two</a>.</p>
<p>The firing pin hits the primer, which ignites the powder, which fires the bullet.  But it's not just a light tap, it has to strike with a decent amount of force.  In order to do that, the hammer (the part you cock back on a pistol, <a href="http://www.thefirearms.guide/wp-content/uploads/diag-gun2-hammer.jpg" target="_blank">highlighted here</a> is spring-loaded.  When you cock it, the hammer is pulled against the spring and held in place until you pull the trigger, which releases the hammer, which hits the firing pin (or is attached to it), which hits the primer...etc.</p>
<p>There are two ways dropping a handgun can cause it to fire.  If the hammer is cocked and you drop it, you may jar the hammer so that it slips past the mechanism holding it back, in which case it slams into the firing pin just like it's supposed to do, as if you had pulled the trigger.  That is not good, and it's also why you should never keep your firearm cocked until you're ready to use it.  But as u/NO_LATTE_NO_PEACE pointed out, many pistols are double-action, so you don't have to cock the hammer first.  The hammer is cocked <em>as you pull the trigger</em> until you reach a point in the swing of the trigger that releases the hammer.  If it's an automatic or semi-automatic weapon, the firing action reloads the gun and cocks the hammer again.  Single-action weapons, like the revolvers of the old west, require you to cock the hammer each time you want to fire, before you pull the trigger.</p>
<p>So if you're carrying a weapon for personal defense, it's probably going to be a double-action, in which case you can carry it without it being cocked and you don't have to worry about wasting the time to cock it.  Single-action weapons are generally considered to be simpler and more reliable.  But that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>The other way a weapon might fire when dropped is if it lands directly on the hammer.  In that case, when the hammer hits the ground and transfers the energy of the drop into the hammer, it pushes the hammer against the firing pin with a lot of force, exactly as if the hammer had been released by the trigger.  The floor hits the hammer, which hits the firing pin, which hits the primer...etc.  However, most modern weapons will not allow the firing pin to touch the back of the cartridge unless the hammer has been cocked first.  There is a mechanism in place that gets between the hammer and the firing pin or prevents the hammer from moving forward unless it's been cocked and/or the trigger is pulled.  With those weapons, you can bang on it as hard as you want and it will not go off... *</p>
<p>* Until the gunpowder ignites from the shock, which is a thing gunpowder can do.  It's <em>possible</em> that if you dropped a gun from high enough the sheer force of hitting the ground would set off the gunpowder, but...that's not a realistic possibility.  It certainly won't happen from you dropping it from your hand onto the ground.</p>
<p>It <em>used</em> to be more common, partly because guns were not designed with the safety features to prevent the firing pin from touching the cartridge.  Older guns simply rested the firing pin against the back of the cartridge, and the hammer against the firing pin when it wasn't cocked.  Obviously, this is pretty unsafe, but hey, guns were still being improved upon so no one had anything better at the time.  We have also significantly improved our understanding of gun safety when we handle weapons so people to know better than to keep a gun cocked when you aren't about to immediately fire it, and technologies like double-action weapons have allowed people to be more comfortable because they don't need to have the weapon cocked before the gunfight starts.  Today it's very uncommon, unless someone is mishandling the gun, the mechanism is malfunctioning, or most likely, both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was somewhat true in the days of old with revolvers where the hammer rested close or directly on the primer of a cartridge. But in modern weapons misfires from dropping have been almost eliminated. There was a recall on Remington 700 rifles because they were causing misfired without pulling the trigger, but only when it was cocked and not on safe. Again though it was recalled. </p>
<p>The mechanism that stops misfires from the hammer directly contacting the primer is very present in the M9/ 92FS series pistols that the military uses. The weapon will not fire unless the trigger is pulled. There is a piece of metal in between the firing pin and the primer of the bullet. This piece will only move unless the trigger is pulled because the trigger is directly connected to this piece. So I can slam the pistol down, throw it, or otherwise try to cause a misfire and it will not unless that trigger is pulled. It also helps that the trigger is fairly heavy, so it falling cannot cause enough energy to transfer into the trigger for it to get pulled, which is what was causing the misfires in the Remington rifles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some older single action revolvers when fully loaded with 6 rounds have the firing pin resting on the primer of one of the bullets. Since they have no safety, a bump on the hammer can fire the bullet. Modern revolvers have a safety that blocks the firing pin from the primer until the trigger is pulled. </p>
<p>Here is a good demonstration of this <a href="https://youtu.be/ldHPNnsp-cs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ldHPNnsp-cs</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  This is Hollywood nonsense. Modern guns do not discharge when they hit the ground.  In fact, most people will tell you that if you drop a gun it is safer to let it just hit the ground than attempt to catch it.  </p>
<p>The only times a gun will discharge on impact is (1) you are using an antique gun design, like a Colt SAA or (2) the gun is damaged and mechanically defective.</p>
<p>That scene in True Lies with the Mac 10 is total nonsense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the gun. Some do though. When people think of  gun they tend to think of something like a revolver or an 1911 pistol, both of which have a hammer that gets pulled back in order to fire. Many guns use an internal firing pin though that is not like a hammer, its more like a spring loaded nail that gets pulled back and compresses a spring, and when you fire, the sharp pin is pushed forward by the spring and strikes the firing cap on the back of the round. </p>
<p>When a gun is dropped it is possible for the shock of landing to push the firing pin back only to have the spring snap it forward again, firing the weapon. You have to put a specific mechanism in place that doesn't allow the firing pin to move unless the trigger is squeezed. </p>
<p>For instance I own a Glock 17c which has a little mechanism on the trigger and the firing pin cannot strike unless the trigger is depressed. So a Glock cannot fire from dropping it if it's working properly. The Glock does not have a manual safety though so if it is cocked, it will always fire if the trigger is pulled and there is no way to prevent that other than to eject the magazine and un-chamber the round. Glock owners will usually tell you that with a Glock the safety is 'between your ears' IE you don't put your finger on the trigger unless you are prepared to destroy what it is aiming at. </p>
<p>Guns like the 1911 on the other hand can block the hammer and prevent the weapon from discharging, but if there is a firing pin it doesn't always immobilize it so it's possible if struck against the ground for the weapon to fire even safed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
