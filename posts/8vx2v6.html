		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your tear film has three layers: mucous, water, then a lipid layer on top. The lipid layer keeps the water from evaporating off your eyes too quickly. As you sleep, if your eyes are open even a little bit, that water layer can evaporate so when you wake up, all that is really left is mucous and the lipid layer. Without the water layer, your tear film is thicker and is more difficult to see through, hence that cloudiness. But when you blink a few times, it clears up as the lacrimal gland releases tears to add to the water layer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's dried out &quot;stuff that sits atop your eyes&quot;.  Atop your eyes you've got layers that are made of fat, water and a bunch of mucousy stuff.  The water can evaporate or dissipate more easily then the others and if your eyes are pretty static, not producing new tears and open a smidge then you'll be left with a disproportionate amount of the fat and mucous.   If you remove the water from that it's just kinda mirky grossness that you're looking for until you blink it away with some fresh tears and movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the blur may also be attributed to corneal edema. Edema meaning swelling and the cornea being the clear domed tissue that is in front of the iris. The cornea can swell with lack of oxygen while sleep but given some time after awakening it will resolve along with potential blurred vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, your eyes have 3 layers of liquid on them to prevent your eyelids from sticking to them and ripping your cornea out(there's a disease that does this) and to protect your eyes. There is a layer of mucus(ew), a layer of lipids(even your eyes are fat) and a layer of water on top(edit-nope, it's on the bottom, I'm an idiot). When you sleep, if your eyes are a tiny bit open(they usually are for most people), the layer of water goes on a vacation (evaporates) and you're left with just some sticky gunk on top of your eye. After blinking for a bit, more water is made in your tear glands and that turns the gunk into water again, so you can see clearly.</p>
<p>Also, it's pretty cool to see the world like you're not wearing glasses, except that I can just, y'know, stop wearing glasses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serious question: what about oxygen? I see a lot of explanations include the 3 layer thing. Once, when I had my eyes checked I asked about waking up with cloudy eyes. The doctor said it was because our eyes &quot;breathe&quot; through osmosis and so since they have been closed for 8-ish hours, they get cloudy. Once you open your eyes and they have time to breathe again, the cloudiness goes away. Any validity to that explanation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
