		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you've got some deep misunderstandings here and the other answers aren't helping. This will be a little more in-depth than a strict eli5 answer, so if that's what you're looking for, you can skip this post, but I'll try to keep it simple.</p>
<p>Biologists classify species by their shared characteristics and their ancestry. In the old linean classification system, invented by Carolus Linaeus in the 18th century, all living things were placed into a hierarchical groupings containing the groups considered to be closest to them in morphology (appearance). So humans, <em>homo sapiens</em>, are  the species <em>sapiens</em> in the genus <em>homo</em>. There were other related species in that genus at one time like <em>erectus, heidelbergensis, and neanderthalensis</em> among others. The genus in turn belongs to a family (for humans, it's <em>hominidae</em>), which then belongs to an order (for us, <em>primates</em>), which then belongs to a class (<em>mammalia</em>, the mammals), then a phylum (<em>chordata</em>, the vertebrates, animals with a spinal cord), and then kingdom (<em>animalia</em>, the animals).</p>
<p>So humans are kingdom animalia, phylum chordata, class mammalia, order primates, family hominidae, genus homo, species sapiens.</p>
<p>Chickens are kingdom animalia, phylum chordata, class aves, order galliformes, family phasianidae, genus gallus, species gallus.</p>
<p>The problem with grouping species according to morphology is that simply appearing similar doesn't mean two species are related. For instance, &quot;moles&quot; have evolved multiple times and came to look quite similar, there's even a marsupial mole! Also, very related species might look very very different.</p>
<p>So nowadays, the trend among scientists is toward the &quot;cladistic&quot; system. Cladistics instead groups organisms by shared ancestry rather than shared characteristics which could be misleading. (This is a massive oversimplification. Both systems mix a lot of techniques and they aren't always used exclusively if one another.)</p>
<p>So, from the cladistic viewpoint, birds aren't just <em>descended</em> from dinosaurs, they <em>are</em> dinosaurs. They belong to the clade <em>dinosauria</em>. Similarly, humans aren't just descended from monkeys, we are a sub-clade of monkeys. Humans are apes which are monkeys. (Again, this is a huge simplification, but this is eli5) No matter what we evolve into, it'll always be a subset of monkeys! </p>
<p>As to why dinosaurs died and birds survived? There are many theories, but they all invoke the fact that different organisms live in different ecological niches. The ecological niche occupied by the recently evolved birds was apparently conducive to their survival I'm the aftermath of whatever cataclysm killed the dinosaurs. There are others in this thread saying birds evolved from the remaining dinosaurs after this event. This isn't true. They had already evolved, but they were just the ones that survived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact: most of the avians at the time of the KT impact went extinct right alongside the other dinosaurs. This included all toothed birds. In fact, the avians barely survived this event, and lost a tremendous amount of their genetic lineage. The few that did survive shared one important characteristic - they were all fresh-water fowl, such as herons and ducks (or the ancient version of this group). This same pattern is repeated amongst almost all the survivors of this mass extinction - animals like crocodilians and monotremes like the platypus seemed especially well adapted for surviving a lengthy impact winter. Which makes sense - rivers as systems do not rely on photosynthesis. Rather, the food chain depends on dead material being washed into the river as nutrition. So while the rest of the planet was starving as plant life died, rivers and the animals that relied on them maintained a food supply, and riverine species would go on to dominate the future ecology of the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: dinosaurs still exist because birds literally are dinosaurs. But even if birds were a distinctly separate group from dinosaurs, bird-like dinosaurs split LONG BEFORE the mass extinction event. The mass extinction event likely didn't even wipe out all stereotypically dinosaurian dinosaurs. So the question just doesn't make much sense, basically... But to elaborate!</p>
<p>Distinguishing birds as being a separate group from dinosaurs (or even reptiles) is actually really weird when you think of how we group other animals. It seems logical to think of a sparrow and an iguana as two very different creatures in distinct groups because their more obviously a-bit-of-both relatives went extinct long before we categorised these animals into man-made groupings.</p>
<p>Here's a mindfuck for you - fish is such a diverse group of animals that some fish are more closely related to humans than they are other fish. And yet we just group all the fish families under &quot;fish&quot;, whilst reptiles get extreme special treatment.</p>
<p>What we conventionally think of as &quot;birds&quot; were flying around when stereotypical dinosaurs were plodding about... For a long, long time. The earliest known dinosaur capable of powered flight is the famous Archaeopteryx, often called the &quot;first bird&quot;. It's from the late Jurassic, which is like 160 million years ago, that's about 100 million years <em>before</em> before T-rex and velociraptor lived! Birds today aren't descended from those dinosaurs towards the end of the &quot;age of the dinosaurs&quot; but split off way earlier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Birds were already around 65 million years ago. They were one group out of many groups that together made up the dinosaurs. Then a big space rock came.</p>
<p>Almost all dinosaurs became extinct except some bird species. Some other bird species became extinct and all other dinosaur species became extinct.</p>
<p>In fact on land almost all animals larger than a medium sized dog became extinct. The birds were all that was left of the dinosaurs and the other groups of animals like mammals were similarly reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may have just been a typo, but just in case, the dinosaurs (specifically the theropods, such as T. Rex and Velociraptor) are the ancestors of modern birds, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all dinosaurs have been wiped out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a little bit of a misconception. One group of the dinosaurs survived the K-T extinction: these were the primitive birds. Are birds dinosaurs? Technically, yes. In the cladistic (cladistics is the school of Biology which organises groups of animals, such as mammals and molluscs) sense, birds are considered to be within the dinosauria clade. As such, and as many paleontologists are quick to remind us, some dinosaurs remain alive. With this style of animal classification, where any animals that have a single ancestor in their lineage are automatically grouped together, some other strange points emerge. For example, all terrestrial vertebrates that descended from the first land-walking lobe-finned fish are considered to be of a single clade: tetrapoda. It also means that birds can be considered reptiles, instead of being a separate class (aves, vs. reptilia), and often are by scientists. Does this mean that mammals are also reptiles? Well, the earliest mammals (synapsids) aren't considered reptiles, though they were certainly reptile-like (hence the clade <em>reptiliomorhpa</em>, which mammals are grouped under). Basically, the classic 5-vertebrate class system (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) taught in high-school biology makes a bit less sense with cladistics. This doesn't really bother taxonomists (those who study this stuff), who are more keen to group animals by their common ancestry and close relations. To distinguish these two significant groups of dinosaurs, sometimes we say &quot;avian dinosaurs&quot; for birds and &quot;non-avian dinosaurs&quot; for everything else.</p>
<p>So what kind of dinosaurs survived the K-T extinction event? Did a small microraptor crawl from the rubble, unscathed, then proceed to sprout wings and fly away? Well, by the time the K-T asteroid hit (at the end of the Cretaceous) theropods were already well on their way to looking like birds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx" target="_blank">Archaeopteryx</a>, which many cite as the 'first bird', appeared during the late Jurrasic (before the Cretacious), while animals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyornis" target="_blank">Ichthyornis</a> in the late Cretaceous appears superficially very much like a modern bird, and could certainly fly. Basically, the transition from bipedal hunters to aerial hunters was well underway by the time the (non-avian) dinosaurs went extinct. Animals closely related to Ichthyornis would have been the dinosaurs which survived the extinction and went on to become birds as we know them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
