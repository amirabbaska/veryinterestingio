		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large stars have more fuel than small stars, but they burn their fuel so much more quickly that they die sooner. Large stars have much greater pressure in their cores due to the larger mass pushing down on the interior, which increases the fusion rate.</p>
<p>In particular, there is an important transition at masses slightly greater than that of the Sun, where instead of fusing using the proton-proton chain, stars fuse using the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle has a larger activation barrier (it's more difficult to force a proton onto carbon than to make two protons collide), so it's not accessible to low mass stars. However, high mass stars are hot enough to power the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle is much, much more efficient than the proton proton chain if you can make it happen, so this effect really accelerates things in stars a bit over 1 solar mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bigger stars have more mass → more gravity → higher internal pressure → hotter → burn faster.</p>
<p>More precisely, <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Main+Sequence+Lifetime" target="_blank">the lifetime of a star on the main sequence scales roughly as M^(-2.5)</a></p>
<p>Yes, bigger stars have more fuel, but they burn through it much faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fusion is driven by the weight of material above the core pushing down and driving up the pressure and temperature. The rate of fusion, as it turns out, is <em>very</em> sensitive to the temperature, particularly at higher masses than the Sun where different nuclear processes start to dominate. So a star with twice as much mass as the Sun burns through that material much more than twice as quickly. Stars with 10 times the mass of the Sun, even though you might expect them to live 10 times as long as the Sun, instead only live for a few <em>million</em> years instead of even the Sun's 10 billion year lifespan. </p>
<p>Smaller stars use their fuel so sparingly that none of the lowest mass stars have died yet. The universe hasn't been around long enough for them to use up what little fuel they have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what was already stated here, small stars also enjoy the advantage of convection.  There is little enough gravitational pressure in a red dwarf that the newly fused &amp; heated helium can rise from the core, making room for cooler hydrogen from above to sink down, replenishing the core's fuel.  The red dwarf can burn nearly all of the hydrogen in the star.  Larger stars stratify the fusion products at the core boundary and lack convection currents.  Ergo, they can only use the relatively small percentage of the star's hydrogen that is within or adjacent to the core as fuel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
