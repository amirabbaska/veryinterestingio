		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food is usually heated prior to being filled into cans, but it doesn't have to be.  Once the can is filled it is sealed, then it is heat processed.  The severity of the heat process usually depends on the pH of the food.  Below a pH of 4.6 it can be pasteurised - given a heating process at 100째C or less.  </p>
<p>Foods above a pH of 4.6 are considered &quot;low acid&quot; foods.  Commercially canned low acid foods are heated to an equivalent of 121째C or 250째F to the centre of the food, for a minimum of 3 minutes (though usually longer). Because it takes a long time to heat the right through the food it will often take about an hour to process something like a can of baked beans at 121째C. This is done in a pressurised vessel called a retort. The pressure prevents the can from bursting or distorting and can allow the use of water for processing (though steam is also commonly used for heating the cans). This temperature and time combination is enough to kill the highly heat resistant spores of clostridium botulinum. If any survive the process they can reproduce and kill the consumer of the food. The legal minimum processing time for a canned food is designed to produce &quot;12 log&quot; reduction in the number of these spores, so if there's a single spore in the very middle of a can it'll have a 1 in 10^12 chance of surviving. Virtually zero.</p>
<p>This bacterium produces botulinum toxin (botox) the most lethal neurotoxin known.  Interestingly it doesn't need oxygen to grow, in fact it is actually an obligate anaerobe - it needs an absence of oxygen.  It prefers the absence of other bacteria, it doesn't produce gas as it grows (so cans don't swell indicating that something is wrong) and the spores often germinate after a significant heat treatment.  It's also the most heat resistant pathogen, which is why it is the target organism of the canning process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the food processing company (or home food preservationist) carefully kills all the germs inside the can either immediately before or immediately after it's sealed.</p>
<p>In home canning (which, if there were any justice in the world, would be called home jarring, because nobody uses metal cans at home, but there ain't no justice), you put your food- tomatoes, asparagus, jam, whatever- into a jar, seal up the jar, and then boil the jar, whole, for several minutes, until the jar and everything in it has been at boiling temperatures, killing any germs that might have been inside. Afterwards, there are no (live) germs inside to spoil the food, and since the jar is sealed, no germs from outside can get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The can is sealed by a hermetic seam, and must pass several quality assurance checks before it leaves the factory. </p>
<p>The food is put in the can, and then sealed before being sterilised to kill all of the bacteria that are present. </p>
<p>If there is any kind of leak on the seam, the bacteria are free to enter and the can,  can (in extreme cases) explode under the pressure of the increase in volume due to the bacteria.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of the double hermetic seam used to seal cans:</p>

<p>TLDR: there is nowhere for bacteria to enter the can, and therefore it cannot perish.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much just seal the food in an air tight container, like a metal can, then boil the can in water to kill off all the germs inside of it with the extreme heat. Afterwards more germs can't get in the sealed container. Works pretty darn well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
