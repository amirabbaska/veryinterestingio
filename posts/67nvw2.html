I don't think we have a hypothesis for what causes the enhanced flow.  I will see if I can talk to someone who would know and will report back.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/1976dave mentioned, SWARM might be a good way to study it. SWARM is a European Space Agency satellite constellation (3 separate satellites flying together) that measures the Earth's electric/magnetic field.</p>
<p>Edit: the reason I say SWARM could elucidate this phenomenon is that it has actually already measured it. The article is missing the actual data plot but SWARM measured a big change in the field as it passed through Steve. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scientists are being really cagey about their hypothesis until they publish—understandably.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39686055" target="_blank">BBC article</a> seems a bit misleading in that it says &quot;it does not stem from the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field.&quot; but if it's a plasma passing within 300km of Earth, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere#Earth.27s_magnetosphere" target="_blank">well, well inside</a> the magnetosphere and must be interacting.</p>
<p>A more appropriate statement would be that it does not stem from the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's <em>atmosphere</em>.</p>
<p>While auroras CAN stretch up to 1000km from the planet's surface, the Kármán line (typically thought of as the &quot;edge of space&quot;) is at about 100km up, so this beam is traveling through space largely unhindered by collisions with atmospheric gas, which is where a genuine auroral glow comes from. It seems likely that it IS a solar wind event, possibly a stream of ionized hydrogen, i.e. protons.</p>
<p>It may be that the plasma is hot enough to emit these wavelengths thermally, but it's also possible that we're seeing <a href="http://jila.colorado.edu/~pja/astr3730/lecture10.pdf" target="_blank">synchrotron
or cyclotron radiation</a> from the plasma's interaction with the planet's magnetosphere. There are plenty of other possibilities, but that's <a href="http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2017/04/photographers-discover-new-pseudo.html" target="_blank">this physicist's current best guess</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
