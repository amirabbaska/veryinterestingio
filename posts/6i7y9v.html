<p>I've always learned that the heart does not grow because an enlarged heart is a terrible thing. So how exactly does a heart &quot;get stronger&quot; from cardio work? Is it perhaps the whole pulmonary system that changes and not just the heart?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart is able to produce new myocardial cells only up to a few days post partum. Cardiac growth in adults happens due to enlargement of existing cardiac cells and to some extent hyperplasia of non-muscle cells (connective tissue cells).
The first measurable change in a cardiac cell under increased workload is the increase in mRNA coding for structural proteins. The cells also increase their mitochondrial mass. These two mechanisms only happen during the development of hypertrophy and are normalized when hypertrophy fully develops. Only permanent changes in the cardiac cells are the increase in cell volume (width and length) and rearrangement of cellular structural proteins (myofibrillar changes).
The exact mechanism of cardiac cell growth also depends on the type of stimulus. When the primary stimulus to hypertrophy is a sudden increase in systolic pressure  the main mechanism is the parallel replication of sarcomeres (proteins responsible for contraction). There are also a couple of nonmechanical stimuli that promote cardiac hypertrophy: the renin-angiotensin system and something that is probably more important in cardio exercise: circulating cathecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Left ventricular hypertrophy which is the growth of the left ventricle can happen from having a very trained body as well. Many pro cyclists and endurance athletes have this, it reduces work capacity due to the hearts overall efficiency. A reason why endurance athletes have crazy low heart rates, the heart is just that efficient at pumping blood.</p>
<p>Now cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy can also happen from years of steroid use coupled with heavy lifting, this is a permanent condition that compromises the overall function of the heart. Your ejection fraction which is the pumping ability essentially decreases, thus compromising your heart and essentially being a cause of death sometimes. This can also happen to obese especially those prone to it genetically, but more common in steroid users.  </p>
<p>Since all steroids essentially cause an erythropeitic response in the blood, which is a signaling of red blood cell production from the kidneys, causing blood to get thicker. This definitely plays a role in the pressure it adds to the arterial lining from elevated blood pressure. Some guys take such high doses for so many years that the androgens cause the heart to grow in itself on top of blood pressure issues.</p>
<p>An athletic ventricle hypertrophy is different because the changes are not permanent to the heart and often reverses once the athlete starts training. </p>
<p>This is kind of the gist of it, I'm starting to rant I guess. Hopefully someone much smarter can chime in.</p>
<p>Cheers! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart does grow in size but it's from bad health.
When you do cardio, the fact that you increase your heart rate (to pump adequate blood/oxygen to your muscles) means your heart muscles expand and contract more effectively. After consistent cardio training, your heart will be able to expand more, and contract stronger. They become more flexible as well as stronger</p>
<p>Edit: heart can also grow in size due to excessive lifting/steroids </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
