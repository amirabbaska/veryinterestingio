<p>Sorry to join the party so late.  Basically you are normally tasting the preservative that keeps the medication around longer.  Once the medication enters the blood stream it pumps up into your heart, then out to the rest of your body.  Since it doesn't have much of a chance to spread the mediation out too much you actually can taste or smell it since both under the tongue and in the nose have small capillaries that allow the transfer of the medication.   I hope that answers your question... I know this is going to be lost in the other comments, but I thought I'd try anyway since I saw a bunch of nothing answers in here.</p>
<p>So ELI5: The medication, once entered into the blood stream, will swim around inside your body, once that blood gets to your mouth or nose it's possible to smell or taste it, the reason being the small capillaries we normally use to smell or taste allows the transfer of the medication taste inwards and outwards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not a certain answer to this. </p>
<p>One argument is that since you are having medication and/or chemicals and/or carrier solutions injected directly into your blood stream, and part of your blood stream goes through your mouth (and tongue, and tastebuds) that you can taste a bit of your blood's content changing. </p>
<p>In many cases, the prevailing answer is that you should <em>not</em> be able to taste it - <em>especially</em> in the case of saline since it actually <em>maintains</em> your bloods salinity. But there are those who argue that an old method of sterilising saline syringes would cause them to leach chemicals which you might be able to taste.</p>
<p>Very harsh meds, like chemotherapy drugs, can have all <em>kinds</em> of side-effects, including making you taste stuff. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: There's no consensus on why this is, or even <em>if</em> it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
