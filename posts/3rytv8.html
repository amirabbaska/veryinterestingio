<p>Paranoia is a psychological condition that causes you to see conspiracies with little direct evidence. Once you believe that you live in a north Korean state, it's easy to believe anything that supports that state is a lie.</p>
<p>You will find that all moon landing deniers and holocaust deniers have strongly negative feelings about the US government.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human memory is a very complex thing.</p>
<p>Recall of a memory refers to the subsequent re-accessing of events or information from the past, which have been previously encoded and stored in the brain. In common parlance, it is known as remembering. During recall, the brain &quot;replays&quot; a pattern of neural activity that was originally generated in response to a particular event, echoing the brain's perception of the real event. In fact, there is no real solid distinction between the act of remembering and the act of thinking.</p>
<p>These replays are not quite identical to the original, though - otherwise we would not know the difference between the genuine experience and the memory - but are mixed with an awareness of the current situation. Memories are not frozen in time, and new information and suggestions may become incorporated into old memories over time. Thus, remembering can be thought of as an act of creative reimagination.</p>
<p>Because of the way memories are encoded and stored, memory recall is effectively an on-the-fly reconstruction of elements scattered throughout various areas of our brains. Memories are not stored in our brains like books on library shelves, or even as a collection of self-contained recordings or pictures or video clips, but may be better thought of as a kind of collage or a jigsaw puzzle, involving different elements stored in disparate parts of the brain linked together by associations and neural networks. Memory retrieval therefore requires re-visiting the nerve pathways the brain formed when encoding the memory, and the strength of those pathways determines how quickly the memory can be recalled. Recall effectively returns a memory from long-term storage to short-term or working memory, where it can be accessed, in a kind of mirror image of the encoding process. It is then re-stored back in long-term memory, thus re-consolidating and strengthening it.</p>
<p>When people get a false notion in their head, it colors all the recollections that come after it.  Over time, the person remembers the past quite differently than it really was.  Additional evidence doesn't fix this, because it doesn't code consistently with the person's memories.  So a bible story that doesn't change (because the pages in the book don't change) much more effectively reinforces itself than exposure to new facts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you considered why you believe that the Holocaust happened? </p>
<p>Think about it. You believe that it happened because people you trust told you it did. You believe that there is a huge amount of evidence because those same people that you trust told you that there is.</p>
<p>Have you examined the evidence yourself? Have you examined huge numbers of written accounts, and analyzed their accuracy? Have you visited the camps, spent years studying forensics, and collected the evidence you need to make a conclusion? Have you even gained enough knowledge to critically examine the work of the people who <em>do</em> claim to have done these things? Have you actually looked through the body of &quot;videos and photos&quot; and considered whether they constitute real evidence for the claims involved? Have you looked at Nazi records discussing mass extermination?</p>
<p>I suspect that 99% of the people on this subreddit have not done all this. I certainly haven't. </p>
<p>Now, I tend to trust the historians who have actually studied World War II. They put in the time, and they say it happened, so I accept that it happened. But I can't pretend that I did the work to gain that knowledge myself - someone else did that, and my acceptance of the Holocaust as a fact depends on my trust of those people.</p>
<p>So if you don't trust the establishment, whether that be the government, or historians, or the mainstream media, then it's very easy to doubt the work that they have done, since almost nobody has actually examined the evidence themselves. This holds true for almost all historical events. If I don't trust the US government to tell the truth for shit, then why should I believe that the first moon landing was anything other than a propaganda piece? All the evidence that says it happened is sourced from somebody I don't trust, and I'm sure as hell not going to go the moon myself to check. </p>
<p>This is why people disbelieve historical events - they don't trust the people who are the sole providers of evidence, and they are not able to put in the years of work to actually accumulate the evidence themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Belief is basically accepting the proof.  No matter what proof is given to some people, for whatever reason their minds will not accept the evidence.</p>
<p>For example - Lets say <em>I don't believe in China.</em>  I've never <strong>seen</strong> it.  I've never traveled that far.  Hell, as far as I know it could be some huge crazy thing and I'm in my own version of the Truman Show.  You could tell me all about China, show me pictures, videos, whatever, but I think it's all part of your conspiracy to trick me.  The proof is not proof because it's all part of the deception.  </p>
<p>So you fly me to China, show me the view from above and we land and walk around.  Okay now I <strong>see it</strong>, I believe it.  You can't do that with past events.  You can't take the JFK conspiracy people back to when he was killed and <em>show</em> them.  No evidence put before them will be believed because they think it's all propaganda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's what most people think about themselves. They are presented with an idea (say the holocaust happened). They consider they evidence. They listen to the arguments. And using their reason, they deduce a conclusion (true).</p>
<p>Here's reality. They are presented with an idea. They consider whether or not they want to believe that idea. Does it fit with what I already believe? Would it put me in a tough position if it were true? How will my peers react if I believe this? They reach a conclusion. They then nod as they consider the evidence and arguments in their favor, and shake their heads at everything else.</p>
<p>Sounds stupid, but everyone acts this way. Including me. Including you. The truth of the matter is, it's really hard to prove things. If you only believed what you could definitively prove, you wouldn't believe much at all. People who doubt these events aren't less capable of reason than those who do. Instead, they disagree because they have different initial biases. </p>
<p>I recommend reading Bertrand Russel's &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot;. In his first few chapters, he shows how hard it is to prove even that anything exists at all (that is, the world isn't an illusion). If you can easily doubt they existence of the entire world, well then it's easy to doubt any particular event now isn't it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
