		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes can’t focus on really near things and really far things at the same time. But we can actively switch between focusing on near things (making far things look blurry) or focusing on far things (making near things look blurry).</p>
<p>This is the process called “accommodation”. There is a biological lens inside each of our eyes, and when the tiny muscles connected to the lens pulls on it or relaxes, it changes its shape, which changes the way light is focused in the eye.</p>
<p>When you “blur your eyes on command”, you’re actually controlling those tiny muscles connected to the lens. You aren’t make everything blurry. You’re just making things at a certain distance blurry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It almost certainly does involve the ciliary muscle. Most people, when they are asleep or are placed in a dark room, or are under general anesthesia, put their ciliary muscle at rest. In physiological terms, this means they are slightly contracted vs. the most relaxed state possible, such that about 1.5 diopters of accommodation is induced. Some people, when they “zone out”, are able to manipulate this balance while awake, although their sensorium is slightly altered. </p>
<p>Why some folks do this “better” than others is unknown, but that applies to many physical abilities. What makes a great athlete, as opposed to a good, mediocre, or non-athlete? It is not just hours in the gym drive or desire to win, although they all play a part. There are innate differences, between people, and I imagine it is the same for this peculiar talent, involving neurosensory and neuromuscular pathways and controls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the muscles around the lens, of your eye which is flexible, relaxing and letting it take it's natural shape. This is also the reason that it hurts to try and focus on something that's too close to your eyes, it squishes your lens too much.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are willfully exercising the ciliary body within your eye. It is comprised of the muscle and processes that are responsible for controlling the shape of the lens of your eye.  This process is known as accommodation and is primarily reflexive but can be controllable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
