		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explaining like If you were 5: </p>
<p>You know when you send a package in the mail, you write the address and maybe, If the package is &quot;Fragile&quot; you'll stamp &quot;FRAGILE&quot; all over it. </p>
<p>Why don't you also stamp &quot;NOT FRAGILE&quot; on the packages that are not fragile? Because It's implicit. If you don't say anything the mailman knows It's not fragile. </p>
<p>Same thing goes for the WWW. Since you can have multiple services on your domain (ex: ftp.address.com which means you want to share files; or mail.address.com which means you want to access the mail server on that domain) in the beginning you'd also write &quot;WWW.address.com&quot; to state that you wanted to access the HTML of the server. </p>
<p>As the web evolved and 99% of the average user wants to access the HTML version of the website, website owners no longer require you to type &quot;WWW.address.com&quot; instead, If you type &quot;address.com&quot; they assume you want to access the HTML version. </p>
<p>Just like you don't need to stamp &quot;NON FRAGILE&quot; on your package, you don't need to type &quot;WWW&quot;. Everyone assumes that's what you want If you say nothing otherwise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the web was invented in 1991 the internet still existed but not as we  know it today. There were many things you could do on the internet, but they all required different programs. You could browse files with &quot;FTP&quot; and &quot;Gopher&quot; programs, you could read news with &quot;usenet&quot; programs, you could send email with mail clients etc.</p>
<p>Often these different services would be on different servers, so they would have a different subdomain. FTP would be on ftp.company.com, gopher on gopher.company.com, news on news.company.com, email on smtp.company.com (to send) and imap.company.com / pop3.company.com (to receive) and so on.</p>
<p>When the web first came along it was still one of many of the different types of services that were around, so went on its own subdomain of www.</p>
<p>After a while it was clear that the web (more specifically web browsers and html) was so flexible that it could basically replace all other services, so now 99% of what everyone does on the internet is through browsers and so it's safe to assume that www will be the default service, so most companies have made the www part optional. </p>
<p>One thing is that even if there is no www part for the website they can still add different subdomains too, so you can have company.com as the website but also ftp.company.com</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, particularly. If you visit reddit.com, apple.com, google.com, microsoft.com, they all redirect you to their site with www in front.</p>
<p>Fashion moved on, people liked not having to type it, not having to say it, and not having to troubleshoot &quot;I can't get to your website&quot; &quot;did you type www?&quot;. It grew increasingly old school and redundant looking.</p>
<p>First browsers tried to autocomplete it - you can type 'example' in a browser address bar, press Ctrl+Enter and browsers make it into www.example.com.</p>
<p>Then website makers started getting rid of it. Either making it so you don't have to type it (visit reddit.com and the site will tell your browser to change it to www.reddit.com) or making their site answer to <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">http://example.com</a></p>
<p>Behind the scenes there's two main things going on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You want to visit a website, and you have to get it from the correct computer. www.reddit.com is a name pointing to some computers which serve Reddit.</p>
</li>
<li>The computers have to know which websites they are serving. The reddit servers will accept requests for &quot;www.reddit.com&quot; and they will ignore requests for &quot;www.outmoieumhcgoermhgc.com&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>So to get rid of www, all that's needed is to make &quot;reddit.com&quot; point to the same computers as &quot;www.reddit.com&quot; and make the computers answer to &quot;reddit.com&quot; and do something sensible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your computer uses DNS to translate domain names like &quot;www.example.com&quot; to a single IP address given in an 'A' DNS record. Your browser then connects to a port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) on that IP address to send and receive data with a particular service. Multiple services like web-servers, FTP, SSH, can work on a single domain name because they use different ports on a single IP address. </p>
<p>However, if you want to use multiple services on your domain that are hosted on separate servers (each with different IP addresses) then they can't use the same full domain name, because one full domain name maps to a single IP address.</p>
<p>To get around that, you can use sub-domains, like &quot;www.example.com&quot; to point to the web-serverâ€™s IP address, &quot;ftp.example.com&quot; to point to the FTP server's IP address etc. The names can be whatever you want, but those are the ones you'll typically see.</p>
<p>So the reason you don't have to use &quot;www.&quot; is because the IP address associated with the root domain &quot;example.com&quot; has been set to point to the web-server, probably because that is the most likely service someone wants to access.</p>
<p>There are still some reasons why websites require you to type 'www.', for example if their website host requires them to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record" target="_blank">'CNAME' DNS record</a> instead of an 'A' DNS record to point to the web-server, then this can conflict with email hosted on the same domain.</p>
<p>Some more modern services like XMPP remove the need to have a separate sub-domain for different IP addresses by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record" target="_blank">'SRV' DNS records</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
