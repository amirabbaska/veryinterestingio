		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spent some time in combat. When they explained the clich√© of someone urinating/defecating/vomitting during combat the trainers cited some studies where it was an evolved behavior. Because your body doesn't want to take a wound that peirces a digestive region causing all that Nasty to leak into other parts of the body it will make you evacuate as much of the waste as possible for preventative measures. &quot;You get shot in the stomach; that sucks. You get shot in the stomach, and poop leaks in to your blood system; that's REALLY bad.&quot; Can't remember the things they cited. I never saw someone defecate, or pee. I did see, and experience involuntary vomit during a firefight, and this post made me think of that. I know it's not an answer for you, but parallel to it.
EDIT: holy smokes! Thanks for the upvotes. Most vets (including myself) think that the public couldn't care less about our experiences. Your votes proved me wrong. Thanks for making me feel relevant when talking about one of the little things vets experience in the nasty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The things that trigger disgust reactions are usually also vectors for disease: poop, gore, vermin, and so on. Your brain is programmed to recognize them as potential contaminants - you're not only disgusted by these objects, but also by any <em>other</em> objects that they may have touched. 'Losing your appetite' (and, in extreme cases, vomiting) is how your brain tells you that anything found in close proximity to these things is unfit to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However, if i get something off texture-wise in my food... like a piece of gristle in a sausage, i completely lose my appetite and cannot eat anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
