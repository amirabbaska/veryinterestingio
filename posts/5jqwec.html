Also, when I say teachers, I'm really mainly referring to elementary and high school teachers.  It just seems to me like those who are charged with educating our children for almost all of their early lives, and those who are charged with serving and protecting, would get paid a little bit more than they do.  I work in IT, and while it's not by much, my entry level position is paid more than an entry level patrol officer with the police department.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't make any money. They rely on public funding. A good employee at a for-profit company helps bring in more money, so the company has incentive to pay them more. A good teacher or police officer doesn't bring any more money to the school or police department, in most cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<p>1) There are lots of people who want those jobs. That good feeling you get when you help someone can be referred to as non-monetary compensation.</p>
<p>2) The benefits are related to the number of people they are directly interacting with. Compare this to a TV star who can entertain millions concurrently through technology.</p>
<p>3) Overall efficiency hasn't gone up much. That is, technology doesn't allow teachers who used to teach 20 students to now teach 500.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my opinion. I hope I don't get too downvoted - instead I welcome someone to show me other ways to think of it. When measured against the metrics that determine whether they did a great job or a poor job their &quot;value over replacement&quot;, or how much extra value they bring over an average person, is low. I pull this theory a bit from sports but hope it makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
