The film features many exciting elements of space exploration, including interplanetary travel, Mars colonization and questions about the effects of Mars' gravity on a developing human in a story about the first human born on the red planet. Let's chat!</p>
<p>Scott will be around starting at 2 PM PT (5 PM ET, 22 UT).</p>
<p>EDIT: Scott thanks you for all of the questions!</p></div></div>

I have read different ideas about colonizing and terraforming Mars but most of them don't deal with the fact that Mars has no magnetic field. And I haven't seen an idea how the terraforming would work in this condition and how the whole planet can be protected from the solar radiation. Thanks.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dear god, I was born ready for this AMA! Mars colonization has been my prime fantasy since I could barely grasp the concept!</p>
<p>I hope you don't mind me overstretching a little bit, I'll try coming with as few concise questions as possible.</p>
<p>A) What are your thoughts on possible living-quarters alternatives on Mars, which one would you say is the most likely to be picked eventually and why? I remember some alternatives about flying there some sort of inflatable quarters to be pre-deployed before manned missions, some dome-building too. As of me, I think that building underground to avoid the radiation without need of much insulation would be best, but digging on Mars could be tricky.</p>
<p>B) If consulted about the use of nuclear energy in a future human settlement in Mars, given the risks it involves vs the benefits in energy surplus &amp; fuel replacement ratio, what would be your call?</p>
<p>C) Do you see an eventual Mars settlement as a sort of scientific &quot;human heritage&quot; like Antarctica or would you consider practical economic benefits for a colonization as a sort of investment or entrepreneurship?* </p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this AMA, im eager to read responses on other questions too! :)</p>
<hr />
<p>* <em>I remember reading somewhere about the factibility of setting a sort of &quot;solar system trade&quot;, where Mars would work as base of operations for mining the Asteroid Belt (due to sheer proximity) &amp; for further space exploration due to lower gravity (lower take-off costs), while exporting valuable minerals back to earth, in exchange for things not possible to produce on Mars, or prohibitively expensive to do so there.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
