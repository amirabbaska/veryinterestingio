<p>The term for those repetitive actions is punding, which is related to Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome. In the case of meth users the punding behavior is iatrogenic, for people suffering from Parkinson's Disease it's a rare symptom of their primary disease.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the repetitive behaviors are called stereotypy. Methamphetamine induces it in both humans and experimental animals. We believe that it is due to the activation of dopamine receptors, though it is not exactly clear which ones (there is evidence to suggest both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors). It would make some kinda of basic sense for it to be D1 receptors, as activating these receptors tends to facilitate motor behaviour. We think the responsible receptors exist on neurons in an area of the brain called the striatum.</p>
<p>On a higher level, we might think about the cerebral cortex as filtering all the sensor data to create a representation about what is happening at a given point in time. We then might think about the striatum as receiving this information on the current state and decided what the correct motor response is. It certainly seems quite likely that when we learn to perform different behaviours in response to some stimuli, the neural plasticity that underpins this learning is happening in the connection between the cortex and the striatum.</p>
<p>If we believe this very loose model, then what we are suggesting is that the activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum is effecting the striatum's ability to decide on what the right behaviour is, and the striatum is instead resorting to the same activity patterns over and over again. Why is it doing this? We don't know. Is this hypothesis correct? We don't know. Could it be something else? Very likely. But it is certainly going to be something along these lines: the synaptic computations that are being done to select the appropriate behaviour given the environment is failing. And this failure is likely due to the activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum.</p>
<p>On a slightly less theoretical nonsense approach, it might be of interest to watch this video of <a href="https://youtu.be/ytcZmzr-QZA?t=68" target="_blank">Michael J Fox</a>. In this video Mr Fox, in order to combat the effects of Parkinson's disease, has recently taken L-DOPA, a dopamine precursor, and his straitum is currently being flood with dopamine, in a manner similar to methamphetamine. You will notice inappropriate movement, and it is not too dissimilar to what someone taking a stimulant like methamphetamine or cocaine might look like. While I didn't notice it in this video, L-DOPA can induce stereotypy in humans and experimental animals. Again,this suggests that dopamine is at the core of drug induced stereotypy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine (DA) and is subsequent neuroreception is responsible for our focus and concentration. Meth users get truckloads (to their horrifying and deleterious consequence) of DA and are able to focus without distraction on a chosen singular task no matter how repetitive without signs of boredom or even fatigue, that is until the DA signal runs out.  After that itâ€™s destination:  crash. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
