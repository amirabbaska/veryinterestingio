		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, things would be more combustible. With higher oxygen concentrations, the limits of flammability of combustible gasses/liquids/solids would increase and the auto-ignition temperature would decrease. In other words, fires would be easier to start and burn at a wider range of fuel to air ratios. Forest fires would be more common and harder to put out.

<p>Would things be more flammable?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tendency to support combustion depends on the partial pressure of oxygen (PPO2). The Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts in a ground test took place in 100% oxygen; since the spacecraft was at atmospheric pressure on the ground, the PPO2 was 14.7psi.<br />
The fix was to launch with a 60% oxygen, 40% nitrogen mix, giving an acceptable PPO2 of 9psi. On the way up, the cabin was vented down to 3psi with all the nitrogen replaced by oxygen, giving a PPO2 of 3psi which is both fire-safe and just right for breathing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think due to the way insects respirate, they would be bigger.  There were huge dragon flies, and spiders the size of dogs during the carboniferous period, but back then, oxygen was 150% of its current level.  I don't think raising it by 1 or 2% would make that huge of a difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There would probably be more cancer and other chronic diseases overall because all animals would have to deal with higher amounts of oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species is one of the main causes of DNA damage). We know from babies treated with higher oxygen due to prematurity that it predisposes them to many chronic diseases, both lung and non lung, later in life.</p>
<p>There is the possibility of adaptations to a hyperoxia environment, so I think altered size could be possible. Additionally, better anti-oxidant systems would probably have to evolve as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
