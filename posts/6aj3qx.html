<p>It is crazy illegal to hire someone without proof of eligibility to work, but unless you show up at the business and vet every single employee, its hard to find out about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it isnt a thing is because illegal immigrants who apply to jobs with false paper work will not come forward and admit it.   If they apply with false paper work there is not much a company can do to prove if they are telling the truth.  They will run the basic background check. </p>
<p>Anything more will cost more money and they cant do it for every single employee. If they do it for anyone who may look &quot;illegal&quot; then thats profiling and racist.  Now, are there employers who will look away on purpose?  Of course but don't pretend this is a one way street. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do.  All businesses are required to check documentation and file paperwork on new hires.</p>
<p>However, if someone shows up with false paperwork, there really isn't much a business can do - and as long as they've followed the correct procedures for verifying legal employment, they're not committing a crime by hiring someone they believe to be legally eligible to work in this country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read up about Alabama... they did just that, passing laws against hiring them, renting to them, etc. and many fled the state.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How would you know that any given business was hiring illegal immigrants in order to boycott them?</p>
<p>1: There are plenty of people who are first generation legal immigrants, you can't go by appearance, language, or mannerisms.</p>
<p>2: companies hiring illegals tend to do so in to positions that are not exactly customer facing (ie: farming, janitorial work, construction, factory workers, etc.) so you probably wouldn't see them anyway.</p>
<p>3: Some illegals use falsified information to appear to be citizens, so even the companies don't necessarily know they hired illegals either.</p>
<p>If it ever comes in to the news that a company has been using illegal labor, it's usually as part of a story where they were caught and the government is either detaining the illegal immigrants for deportation proceedings, or investigating the company in question to see if they can be fined(or both) so there's little point in further punishing them via boycotts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
