		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regular matter is made of atoms. And every atom has a nucleus, made of protons and neutrons. Some nuclei are <em>unstable</em>, meaning that they decay. When a nucleus decays, it emits radiation.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of nuclear radiation. Some examples are alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, protons, neutrons, conversion electrons, fission fragments, clusters, and more. These are generally <em>ionizing</em> radiation, which means that the particles have enough energy to break chemical bonds or knock electrons out of atoms. This is the kind of radiation that can cause cancer. The radiation emitted by a phone or a WiFi router is <strong>not</strong> ionizing.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>On a very basic level, ionizing radiation damages your DNA. This causes mutations which can lead to cancer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we use radiation therapy to cure cancer when it also gives us cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ionizing radiation can be used to kill cells. If you point your beam of radiation at cancerous cell, it will kill them. We have sophisticated techniques to specifically target the cancerous tissue with beams of radiation. The treatment kills cancerous tissue while delivering a much smaller dose to the surrounding healthy tissue.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You can't stop radioactive nuclei from decaying, but you can certainly shield against radiation. Different types of radiation are easier to stop than others. For example, alpha particles are very easy to stop with a piece of paper, or even just a few inches of air. On the other hand, fast neutrons are much harder to stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to /u/RobusEtCeleritas's nice coverage:</p>
<p>The reason some types of radiation are so penetrating is that those types have no electric charge, so they don't interact very often with matter.  This includes x-rays and gamma rays, which are just high-energy forms of light, and neutrons, which are one of the particles that make the nuclei of atoms.</p>
<p>To focus on the x-rays and gamma rays, while they don't interact very often with matter, when they do interact they tend to dump most of their energy into it at once.  So we just need to make the shielding thick enough so that most of the radiation will hit something.</p>
<p>As an example: for the high-energy x-rays used in radiation therapy, about 40 cm of concrete will stop 90% of x-rays.  Another 40 cm will beef that up to 99%, another 40 cm 99.9%, and so on.  Usually in radiation therapy vaults, the main shielding is concrete about 200 cm (6 feet) thick, which will stop 99.999% of the radiation, which is enough to make working outside the vaults quite safe.</p>
<p>This is all a very well-understood science, and experts such as Health Physicists and Medical Physicists exist to make sure radiation can be used safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with nuclear radiation is neither bad nor good it simply is. </p>
<p>Radiation is a natural phenomenon that happens in the universe it powers the stars, and thus the plants and and all life on earth. </p>
<p>Radiation can come from many sources through natural decay, everything decays you me, the air, that rock over there everything. What that means is that some parts of the core of an atom called the nucleus breaks apart from the atom and escapes. This for most element doesn't happen very often, we however know that half of will decay in the same amount of time as the rest of it. </p>
<p>We consider something radioactive when it decays at a rate which is high. </p>
<p>What radiation is, is complicated. But as you assumed there are different types of radiation out there. </p>
<p>Let talk about the major different kinds of radiation. </p>
<p>Alpha radiation means a helium core (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) escapes a larger atom. Notice how I say the core because alpha particles have no electrons, and thus have a charge. </p>
<p>Beta radiation is a type of decay inside the protons or neutrons that release a electron (or a positron) and neutrino (elementary particle) in essence it what's happens when a neutron and proton change into one another they release a beta wave. </p>
<p>A Gamma ray is electromagnetic discharge from excited atoms coming back to normal States, they have very high energy. Gamma rays also tend to penetrate most objects they are the rays that the large walls are really protecting you from as almost anything can block an alpha ray and it takes very little to block a beta rays. </p>
<p>Now what does all this mean? It means that radiation comes from processes that are changing the core and thus element of an atom. When atoms changes into one another, they use fusion (two small make one big) or they fission (one big makes two small). It also means that these radiations at certain levels are capable of marking other atoms decay. </p>
<p>Now when we are talking about nuclear energy we are talking about controlling this decay. Because these things have a weird property, when you add all the mass from before the decay and then add up all the mass after they don't equal each other, some of the mass was turned into energy this energy is carried by the alpha, beta or gamma ray (and many times all three). We can use this energy to turns a magnet which creates electricity in a turbine. Basically we take elements that are already have a high rate of decay and then we send in some focused rays to cause them to start decaying enough that it creates a chain reaction of atoms splitting and there splitting parts being used to make more of the split and so on. </p>
<p>When we are talking about bombs we means we cause a lot of decay to happen as close to instantaneously as we can and thus making the release of energy high and explosive. We basically crush the particles so that they end up so compact they have no other choice but to run into each other, which causes the chain reaction in much more spectacular and less controlled form. </p>
<p>Radiation is dangerous because they can change the structures of other atoms, through enough radiation at a nuclear cell and some of the cells will start to have serious problem because the atoms and molecules will have changed structure, which means they won't act the way the cell wants them to anymore, they will decay. </p>
<p>One should mention nothing is going to make you or anything else more radioactive. You won't become suddenly start b OMG radioactive more because you experience radiation (the radiation may affect you in a certain way but not in that way), you are already giving off radiation just at a rate so small it doesn't matter. You however can become contaminated, meaning cover in a radioactive material (usually meaning in a fine dust or somehow soaked in it) you are not radioactive you are contaminated with radioactive elements. So no you won't start flowing and nor will anything else. </p>
<p>Now certain types of tissue for various reason are more affected than others and some are most affected by certain types of radiation rather than others.</p>
<p>This is much more complicated than this and is meant to be an introduction there are whole courses on the affects, causes and sources of just alpha radiation. And so a reddit post isn't exactly going to explain everything or truly explain it accurately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some nuclei are unstable, which means they have a probability of disintegrating, and thus some natural rate of disintegrating. When they disintegrate there tends to be energy &quot;left over&quot; which results in highly energetic decay products. If a nucleus is excited then it can release gamma rays (high energy photons) as it settles down. Or, the nucleus might emit a high energy electron (beta particle) or anti-electron (positron) in the decay. Or it might release an alpha particle, or a neutron, or a proton, or something else. <em>That</em> is radiation. Particles or photons &quot;radiating&quot; out of matter containing unstable nuclei.</p>
<p>Due to the extraordinary number of atoms in even mundane amounts of matter even an incredibly low probability of disintegration can translate to a rate of disintegrations and an amount of &quot;radiation&quot; generated that can range from merely detectable to hazardous. When a particle or photon of &quot;radiation&quot; hits other matter it can deposit its energy into an atom/molecule that it hits. This can ionize atoms (which is where it gains the name &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;), break atomic bonds, and effectively destroy molecules. Because organisms are based on molecular machinery and molecular media for genetic information storage the destruction of molecules can wreak havoc on the proper functioning of a cell.</p>
<p>Radiation can kill you outright by effectively killing enough of the cells in organs you need to live. It can also cause mutations across a huge number of cells, one of which might result in a cell becoming dangerously cancerous, which may or may not kill you years in the future. Non-lethal levels of radiation can also potentially be used beneficially. The basic concept is twofold. One is that by moving a radiation beam around it's possible to sweep it over healthy areas of the body (reducing the individual exposure levels there) while at the same time keeping it held on cancerous areas (increasing the exposure levels there). The other is that because cancerous cells are abnormal they are potentially more vulnerable to being killed through damage than healthy cells, so by damaging both it's hoped that the cancerous cells will be killed off while the healthy cells and organs will be able to recover (this is the same basic principle as chemotherapy, to some degree).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>EM radiation is photons of varying energies the energy corresponds to the frequency of light</p>
<p>examples : radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x rays, gamma rays</p>
<p>Nuclear radiation is particles of matter usually travelling at extreme speeds, that is to say they have large amounts of momentum and kinetic energy</p>
<p>examples: Beta radiation is electrons, the particles carry a charge.
Alpha radiation is helium nuclei which are massive and also carry an electric charge and Neutrons which do not carry a charge</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
