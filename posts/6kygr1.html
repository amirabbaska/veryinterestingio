And now that the weather is so humid and sticky my clothes are taking longer to dry on the clothes horse than normal.  So, my question is this:  Why do your clothes start to smell sour/bad when they take to long to dry or are left sitting damp for a while? </p>
<p>EDIT:  Unreal response from people regarding this.  Didn't expect to get such a huge and varying reaction.  A few things:  </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not looking for a solution - I'm interested to why this happens.  Bacteria Poo is my favourite so far. </li>
<li>Yes, a clothes horse is a real thing. Maybe it's a UK term, but it's essentially a multi-story rigid washing line that sits in your house. (credit to the dude who posted Gandalf.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will probably get buried, but to reiterate what everyone says, it's due to the growth of bacteria and mold on your clothes.</p>
<p>Note that most laundry detergents never claim to be antibacterial/antifungal because the wash cycle or its temperature isn't the &quot;antibacterial&quot; component of washing. It removes dirt and oils generally.</p>
<p>It IS the drying of the clothes that kills the bacteria and mold and prevents further growth. This is why slightly damp clothes that aren't fully dry, can end up smelling after a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the fibers used in cloth are food for microorganisms, so you're wearing the equivalent of a ripe field or grocery store to molds.  One reason they rarely are able to take advantage of the bounty in your clothes is that they exchange water with their environment and you keep the food in an environment that's far too dry for them to keep enough water to survive.  </p>
<p>When you leave wet clothes in a place where they can't dry out, it allows them to successfully eat, reproduce, and eat more.   Which results in them creating chemicals you are very sensitive to (anyone who didn't notice microorganism's odor was much more likely to get infections which are quite threatening before antibiotics.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>googled it:</p>
<p>Clothes that have recently been washed may smell sour due to a build up of soap scum inside the washing machine. Bacteria and mold grow in the dampness of the washing machine and feed on soap scum, which is typically made up of body oils, skin and soap residue.</p>
<p>To prevent the sour smell from freshly washed clothing, clean, sanitize, and deodorize the gaskets, dispensers and drum of the washing machine. Remove the soap, bleach and fabric softener dispensers, and wash them in the sink. Clean the rubber door seal, or gasket, with an old toothbrush or cotton swab and a solution of 1 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of bleach.
After surface grime on the inside surfaces has been wiped away, sanitize the washer by setting the wash cycle to hot and adding 4 cups of chlorine bleach to a top-loading washing machine and 2 cups of bleach to a front-loading washing machine. Pause the cycle halfway through, and let the bleach water soak in the basin for 30 minutes. The bleach water eliminates the bacteria and mold that has been growing in the unreachable crevices of the washing machine. Drain the bleach water, run a water-only rinse cycle to remove all leftover bleach, and use a water and vinegar solution to deodorize the washing machine and remove hard water stains. Add 4 cups of vinegar for a top-loading washer and 2 cups for a front-loading washer, and set the cycle to hot. Let the solution soak for 30 minutes, and rinse the machine with plain water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called Mildew, it's a fungus. It's not from bacteria or anything like that.  Mildew needs several things to thrive - a food source (anything organic including clothes), relative humidity (60%+) and warmth (77F+).</p>
<p>Most likely you live in an environment that has high humidity, and thus the clothes aren't drying in the air, as the water won't evaporate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi are the actual cause of the smell, more specifically the waste that these micro critters produce. Similar to body odor, the micro organisms thrive in moist and warm conditions, so they eat, then poop. Poop=smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
