<p>ELI5 answer: They don't die instantly but they do usually lose consciousness when conditions are correct. Death follows shortly after.</p>
<p>Technical answer: When the bullet strikes body you have several things happen in a very short amount of time. The first is the force of the bullet transfers into the target's flesh tearing and ripping tissues apart. all of this results in a very large hole formed by the force of the bullet being transferred to the body's tissue. Then this cavity mostly collapses and thus is known as the Temporary Wound Cavity. Most muscle and fascia tissues recover their shape from this shock, the two tissues that do not are the kidneys and liver. They shred. Blood vessels also do poorly.</p>
<p>The cavity that still exists after the bullet shock subsides is known as the Permanent Wound Cavity and is usually filled with bits and pieces of the tissues surrounding it and blood. </p>
<p>The bullet continues into the body, passing through bone, muscle, blood vessel, nerves and organs. When the round has hit what is known as the &quot;T-slot&quot; death is usually instantaneous or close enough that it doesn't matter. The &quot;T-slot&quot; is the shape formed by the intersection of the eyes and nose. When aiming at the &quot;T-slot&quot; from straight on the lower part of the brain and brainstem are directly behind this reference point. While aiming from the diagonal or side, adjustments must be made. When the brainstem is severed, all activity stops. </p>
<p>The other way that we can achieve instant incapacitation of the target body is to achieve hydrostatic shock. The body is made mostly of water and for our purposes it transmits energy pretty well. Two very large blood vessels run up and down the spine and the heart and lungs are centrally located or, at &quot;center mass&quot; of the torso. By placing one or more shots to center mass in under 1.5 seconds we drastically increase the amount of damage that occurs in the body from shock waves traveling through the bodies fluids. Usually when hydrostatic (or hydraulic) shock occurs there is an instant loss of consciousness followed by tearing damage throughout the cardiovascular system. There have been autopsies that have shown blood vessels in the brain suffer damage from chest shots. From my understanding, this change in fluid pressure shuts the brain off, either permanently or temporarily. This might be what you are referring to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions about my very specific area of knowledge I would be happy to oblige.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the replies in this thread are forgetting an absolutely vital part of human anatomy, the <a href="http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/image_article_collections/anatomy_pages/aorta.jpg?resize=646px:*&amp;output-quality=100" target="_blank"><strong>aorta</strong></a></p>
<p>The Aorta is the largest artery in the human body, which runs from the left ventricle of the heart down to you pelvis and then splits off.</p>
<p><strong>Gunshot trauma to the aorta is in almost all cases invariably fatal from sudden cessation of all blood pressure</strong></p>
<p>Just going to cite this here as an edit with an attached quote for context: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8614076" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8614076</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overall mortality was 80.6% (87.5% for gunshot injuries, 64.7 % for knife injuries).</p>
<p>Victims with injury to the thoracic aorta were more likely to have an unrecordable blood pressure on admission than patients with abdominal aortic injuries (73% vs 28.4%),</p>
<p>The introduction of a dedicated trauma program, which resulted in significant reduction of mortality in other types of severe trauma, had no effect on the outcome in aortic injuries.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be completely instant, but a bullet to the heart would cut off blood flow, which would in turn, stop oxygen flow (because oxygen needs blood to flow). This would halt your brain processes because your brain requires constant blood and oxygen to operate. </p>
<p>This would all happen pretty quickly but not <em>instantly</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, people don't. </p>
<p>There is a fairly small line of impact in the chest which would instantly put a human down. A heart shot will - depending on a variety of factors - stop the circulation of blood to the brain, which can make a person unconscious within seconds. Extremely prompt and effective medical care could save a life at this point. A gunshot into the torso which severs the spinal cord will paralyze an individual, although not necessarily kill them. </p>
<p>Even a gunshot which does impact the brain is not necessarily fatal, unless it destroys the brain stem. If the brain stem is damaged, death immediately follows. </p>
<p>Famous case examples: at least one of the suspects in the 1986 Miami FBI shootout was shot multiple times in the chest, including lung shots, and shots which bruised the heart and spinal cord. The fight continued for over four minutes. </p>
<p>U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords was shot in the head (brain) in January 2009 suffering brain damage however is still alive. </p>
<p>Note: I am not a medical professional, however I am a police officer and Afghanistan combat veteran. The human body is remarkably resilient, and gunshots are not often fatal. Shots to the chest are remarkably survivable <em>in general</em> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
