<p>She says that whether or not something floats is determined by the density but ALSO the volume and/or depth of water in the container.</p>
<p>E.g. if I put an egg in the sink bowl it will sink and she says that it might float if I put it in a full pint glass as there's 'more depth water to make it float'</p>
<p>Assuming there is at least enough water to submerge the object in, can you help me explain why she's wrong? </p></div></div>

<p>So, as long as the weight of the amount of water displaced by the object is <del>less</del> <em>more</em> than the object itself, the object will float regardless of how much other water there happens to be.</p>

<p>A tricky apparatus is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_thermometer" target="_blank">Galileo thermometer</a> where the floating objects are very close to the density of the liquid.

<blockquote>
<p>there's 'more depth water to make it float'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>To everyone commenting:</em> She's not saying the water is too shallow to float it because the egg will rest on the bottom, she's thinking the extra depth of water gives the water extra ability to float objects. Her bath example is wrong because she's touching the bottom (I'd be impressed if someone can float in a pool without going deeper than a bathtub), but that's not the misconception that's throwing her off.</p>
<p><em>To OP:</em> She's not entirely wrong to think depth of water changes some characteristics of the water, but her logic is upside down. The water at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the glass is affected by the weight of the water above it (because of gravity) but the water at the <strong>top</strong> of the glass is not affected by any water underneath it. There's no force that propagates up from the bottom and is increased by additional water depth to make the water more able to float an egg.</p>
<p><strong>It's like if you stack up 5 bricks - the bottom brick is feeling the weight of all 4 bricks above it but the top brick doesn't feel the weight of the 4 bricks below it.</strong> <em>(edit for emphasis because this is the nutshell of it)</em></p>
<p><em>A few more words</em></p>
<p>As water gets deeper, it does get denser - the pressure increases from all the water above a certain point. However, water's not very compressible so the density doesn't change much (because &quot;more dense&quot; means you've squeezed the same number of molecules into a smaller space). So if you drop an object <em>ever so slightly</em> denser than water it into a very deep well, eventually it will stop sinking because the density of the water below it is higher than the density of the object. So now it's floating because the water is deep (and dense) enough. But like I said water will compress a minimal amount so your object's density has to be just a hair's edge more than water's for this to work.</p>
<p>Counter intuitively, this increased pressure only depends on the depth of the water and not on the volume. If you have a tube 1 cm in diameter and 10 m long filled with water, you can measure the same pressure at the bottom of the tube as you would if it were a culvert 1 m in diameter of the same height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
