		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to take a look at it from another angle - while you were about to do the dishes all by yourself, you had a choice and you knew it. You chose to do the dishes. When someone tells you to do it, you lose your perceived ability to choose. Sure, you could refuse to do the dishes but there would be negative consequences now so you feel as if you were robbed of that choice.  </p>
<p>I remember reading about a study which boiled down to people less bothered by doing boring or menial stuff if they feel they can always choose not to do it. Unfortunately, I cannot find it.  </p>
<p>edit: ELI5<br />
&quot;It is my choice, I could always choose not to do it but I don't because I am a responsible person.&quot;<br />
vs.<br />
&quot;Ah, crap, I have to do the dishes now because if I don't I'd get scolded. I can't choose not to do the dishes, it has become a chore now.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your motivation goes from being intrinsic -behavior driven by internal reward- to extrinsic -behavior driven by external reward. Intrinsic motivation is more satisfying and focuses on your own needs, so you are more likely to want to do whatever that motivation entices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the person asked you to do the chore it was your decision to do the work you were in charge of your action and nobody could point to who you were doing the work for or why you were doing it. After the person asked (or ordered) you to do it you now are subservient and subordinate to that person, you are doing the work for them. You want to be autonomous, you want power and control over your life. Its commonly felt by teens or older adults living at home with their parents or by a spouse that is in a lopsided relationship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this called Bird-Dogging.  It might be a local thing to North East Texas but we had bird dogs that loved to chase squirrels.  But they wouldn't chase them until the squirrels were already running away.  8 or so years later we had another pair of bird dogs, and same thing.</p>
<p>So anytime someone would come behind you while you were already in the prep-stages for a task and ask you to do the very thing you were already going to do, we would say, &quot;Stop bird dogging me&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
