Like if I don't eat or drink for about 4 hours, what is in my stomach? I'm assuming it's some kind of acid but what's the amount that would be in there? Thanks.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen the inside of thousands of stomachs while anesthetizing people for upper endoscopies.  Most of them are mostly empty.   All of these patients have had nothing to eat or drink for 8+ hours.</p>
<p>The stomach collapses down when you haven't put anything into it.  This is different than the heart and lungs, which keep a volume of blood and air in them, respectively, and need to do so to function properly.</p>
<p>If there is still retained food in the stomach after a prolonged fast, it's frequently due a condition called gastroparesis, which means &quot;paralyzed stomach&quot;.  Gastroparesis is more common in diabetics, but non-diabetics can have it as well.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115349" target="_blank">this study</a> which quantified the amount of water in the fasted stomach as 35 ± 7 mL, so about an ounce.  When we put oro- or nasogastric tubes into patients having general anesthesia, we usually get about that much stomach juice back.  In patients with bowel obstructions, we can get a liter or more out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anesthesiologist, so supposedly my patients haven't had any food or drink since the night before.</p>
<p>When I do anesthesia, I often drain stomachs with a tube in case they've eaten since unfortunately, people lie occasionally. However, I believe 99.9 percent tell me the truth.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'd say an average person has about 50 cc of stomach fluid. Diabetics, who often have a disorder called gastroparesis (basically slow emptying of the stomach), have between 100 and 250cc.</p>
<p>Staying that, I pretty regularly find chunks of food. Most recently, a gentleman had green specks of something in his stomach. Upon closer inspection, it was chewed up dried seaweed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a radiologist and I see a lot of discussion in this thread about gastroparesis and I wanted to point out a relevant nuclear medicine exam which pertains to this as well as OP's question. It's called gastric scintigraphy and it's done by giving you a standardized meal which is essentially an egg sandwich containing a (minimally) radioactive substance called sulfur colloid and measuring how long it takes for your stomach to pass the food through. A &quot;normal&quot; person will clear at least 90% in 4 hours.</p>
<p>We do it all the time and it works great! </p>
<p>Tl:Dr: your stomach is generally greater than 95% empty by 4 hours after a small meal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if I can cite you a specific source, but I routinely perform autopsies (pgy-1 pathology resident), and if someone is on tpn there is still a scant amount of fluid in their stomach (about 10-20 ml or so). This is there primarily because the stomach epithelim is glandular tissue who's function is designed to literally to secrete mucous and acid.  It performs this at a basal rate that is always there. Functionally it also helps lubricate the mucosa to prevent abrasion and damage to a more delicate epithelium.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see tens of stomachs daily on CT scans. 4 hours isn't even nearly long enough to do it. The ventricle or the stomach is almost never empty as it maintains acid mixture production. The thin gut isn't empty either after this time, i usually see it collapsed after prolonged period of fasting or, most often when there is some kind obstruction 'upstream' or as we say 'orally' (yes, 'oral' and 'anal' are legitimately used adjectives here). The colon or thick gut always have some fecal matter residues and/or filled with air/gas - coloscopy is bad example here as you are prepared for them in 48 hours period, ending with laxatives of small Niagara potency.</p>
<p>So TL;DR if you are not old, chronically​ ill person there is always stuff in your gut even after day or two of fasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
