		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are doing (kinda), but perhaps in a way that you might not expect.  </p>
<p>The only way to increase CO2 uptake really is to increase photosynthesis and growth rate. We don't want to do that too much to algae because that could choke the lakes and seas, killing fish and devastating the ecosystem. Similarly, we don't want to do it to bacteria because bacteria were brought up properly by their parents and always share- by which I mean that they can transfer their genes laterally to other species. Think C.Diff is bad? Imagine if it develops a growth rate that's twice as fast. Not good.  </p>
<p>What we <em>are</em> doing however, is looking into plants. Depending on when you last studied biology you may or may not know that there are many different types of photosynthesis. Most plants use C3 photosynthesis, which was a lot better back when there was more CO2 in the air and less oxygen, but is increasingly inefficient. Some plants use C4 photosynthesis, which works better in all sorts of ways. C4 plants use less water, grow faster, and generally need less fertiliser. Sugar cane is a crop that naturally uses C4. A lot of work is being done to engineer more plants to use C4 photosynthesis, which would have the benefits of more food for less water and fertiliser, but equally take more CO2 out of the air.  </p>
<p>TL;DR, we're trying to make plants grow faster and more efficiently as a way to give more food and take more CO2 out of the atmosphere </p>
<p>Edit: a few follow up questions have been quite common;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No this would not be a good solution to climate change, most of the CO2 taken up would be released by decomposition, however trees modified to C4 could help with reforestation efforts by growing quickly. C4 trees could possibly grow faster than C3 trees, and if the total amount of biomass increases as a result, then more CO2 will be sequestered.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many scenarios where C3 is better than C4; it tends to be better in cooler, wetter environments with lower oxygen levels. However as the climate warms up, C4 will be increasingly important. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, growing algae in vats would not be a good solution. Any fuel generated would release this CO2 back into the environment. Yes, this would possibly reduce the amount of new CO2 being added to the atmosphere by preventing fossil fuels being burnt, at best this is carbon neutral, it doesn't actively decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>A lot of people are upset by me using the figure of 25% more efficiency for C4 plants. The fact is that around 25% of all photosynthesis reactions in C3 plants go wrong, trying to fix O2 rather than CO2, in a process called photorespiration. If you want a source for this, see:</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember it is no good just getting plants to take up CO2 if they end up releasing greenhouse gases back into the air eventually, eg when they rot.  Wood is good as it can replace some fossil fuel usage but soft plant material is less of a solution.</p>
<p>What is really needed is permanent sequestration, ie CO2 that is taken in but never, ever released again.  Anything else is just putting off the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a back of the envelope calculation would show that you need massive amounts of these plants/algae/bacteria in order to really offset the amounts of CO2 we produce in the world. These amounts might not make it a legit solution and therefore research might be focused on more value adding solutions. Solutions that prevent the production of CO2 instead of reversing/storing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR:it's not that simple to make plants consume more CO2, other needs(water, light, nutrients) can be limiting, CO2 has to be transported to the place where photosynthesis happens, and GMO isn't magic.</p>
<p>the plant also has to get the CO2 to where it needs to go, which is limited by the CO2 concentration in the air, how fast the air around the leaves is refreshed(wind, and if the leaf has hairs more air stays still around it), and how quick that air can enter the stomata(small holes in the leaves, basically a leaf's lungs). then how quickly the CO2 is transported from inside that buble of air into the plant's cells(to think of a rough comparison, think of how the oxygen you breathe has to get from the air in your lungs into your blood).</p>
<p>next, you need enough light to use that CO2. then you need enough nitrogen, to grow new plant-parts and intercept more light. and other nutrients that are needed in smaller amounts. reducing all those limiting factors is not easy to do for any poor farmer, and depends on the climate. farmers in rich countries can get very far, but greenhouses are best since you can also control CO2-levels and reduce waterloss to outside the greenhouse. but still sunlight has a limit.
so at each of those steps you need to find solutions(and then a way to actually get it, either with conventional breeding or gmo, or management practices).</p>
<p>you would need leaves with a lot of area and no hairs, which keep their stomata wide open. open stomata also leads to a lot of evaporation of water, so you need to provide plenty of water. you need some wind to refresh air around the leaves, and enough light and nutrients.</p>
<p>one big thing you could do is go for C4 plants. C4 plants have a clever adaptation to one big efficiency-loss. the chemical that binds CO2 in plants, so that it gets from the air into the plant cell, can also bind oxygen. you could increase CO2-concentration(that's done sometimes in greenhouses), so there's more CO2 vs. oxygen. C4 plants do something like that too, they use a different chemical, that only binds CO2, and then transport the CO2 into a kind of airducts in the leaf where the CO2 concentration becomes very high and the original chemical can do it's work with high efficiency.</p>
<p>however, it's not easy to turn a C3('normal' plant) into a C4, since it's not just that one chemical, but also the airducts in the leaf. (little sidenote, it's not like C4 is rare, maize is C4 for example) and C4 do better at higher temperatures, so in temperate regions there's not that much to gain from turning a C3 into a C4. and actually, the reason that there is interest in turning C3 into C4 is due to using less water, not more CO2. since they can deal with lower CO2 concentrations, they can keep their stomata closed more often, so they evaporate less water.</p>
<p>and last, I think you're thinking of gmo as magic a bit too much. gmo sounds like it can do everything, but there are actually still a lot of problems. if you know what you want(let's say plant without hairs on leaf, C4 photosynthesis including the leaf anatomy), you need to find all the genes that do those things first. that is possible, but it's still something that takes time, money  and researchers. then you need to find a way to paste those genes into an existing plant, and grow a healthy plant where the editing succeeded and that can reproduce. and then you need to do breeding to actually make that plant good. if you made a gmo supertomato that is resistent to any pest, but you get shitty tasteless, small, green tomatoes, it's still worthless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
