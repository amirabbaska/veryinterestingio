		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fun one, because there's so many different answers that are correct</p>
<p>So, the first one to deal with is simply fundamental to all wave propagation - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">Inverse Square Law</a>. So lets say a wave leaves a point, with a power of X.  Once it's travelled 1m in a given direction, it should also have a power of X.  Except, it hasn't <em>just</em> travelled in that given direction.  It's travelled in all possible directions, creating a sphere in space.  That original power of X is now the total of the energy across the surface of that sphere, and the energy at a given point is a mere fraction of what it was only a meter ago.</p>
<p>Picture an inflating balloon. When it has only just enough air in it to actually form its shape, it looks opaque.  But as it starts to expand, it becomes more translucent - because you still have as much material as you started with, no more no less - but it's being stretched further.  Inverse-Square law is the maths behind how this affects waves.</p>
<p>(You can stretch this one with directional antenna, but you can't beat it.)</p>
<p>The next thing we have to deal with is .. something I don't understand the science behind at all.  Different wavelengths have different propagation characteristics.  The most striking example of this, is the difference between visible light, and x-rays.  Visible light can be blocked by a piece of fabric, while the x-rays will go straight through it.  There's similar differences in the radio end of the spectrum.  My house has heavy concrete construction - I have no problem receiving commercial FM statations (~100MHz), but it stops wifi (~2400MHz) in its tracks.</p>
<p>So from this we're going to get considerable path loss.  Microwaves are going to bounce and refract around a lot more than longer waves, so every molecule they meet, be it walls, air, cats, is going to give us signal attenuation.</p>
<p>Now, we have why these two points matter - background noise.  That hiss of 'static' you hear when you tune a radio to nothing, is the background noise of the universe.  Even if you were the only person on earth, it'd still be there.  So one of the characteristics we look for in a radio receiver, is 'sensitivity'.  This is how much stronger a signal has to be over the 'noise floor' (that hiss) before the receiver can distinguish between them.  If the difference between the signal and the noise, is greater than your receiver's sensitivity - you win!  Once it goes below this line, it's frustrating, and once it goes below the noise floor .. it's gone.</p>
<p>That bit's fun for me.  This means your signal is actually travelling forever - it's just indistinguishable from every other signal that's travelling forever.  When we talk about range, we're only talking about the part of the path where the signal betters the noise by enough to be useful.</p>
<p>Final thing I'll touch on, is .. humans.  They mess everything up.  Humans introduce two new factors to this.  First, they'll introduce more noise.  Since you're not actually the only human on earth, you're competing with every other signal out there.  Everyone around you, using the same band (microwave ovens, dect phones, bluetooth, wifi ..), is contributing to that background noise.</p>
<p>The second thing humans add, is rules.  So, there's 11-13 channels for wifi (in the 2.4GHz band, and depending on country).  If your next-door neighbour is trying to use the same band as you, you'll find out quickly.  It's hugely frustrating.  So if we took the simple approach to boosting our wifi range, and tried to use 50W instead of 500mW .. so would our neighbours.  And now, instead of trying to compete for those 11 channels within neighbourhood of 50-100meters, you'd be competing with the entire city.</p>
<p>This last bit is the interesting bit.  If wifi signals travelled forever, wifi would be useless.  The 2.4GHz ISM band would have enough space for 13 sending stations, and the rest of us could only listen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of appropriate antennas and an upper limit on power severely limits range.</p>
<p>Almost all wifi devices use an <del>isotropic</del> <em>omnidirectional</em> antenna, meaning they detect/emit waves in all directions equally well.  This is a very desirable property because it means you don't have to point your device at the access point to get a signal through.  Downside is if you double the physical distance between you and the base station the signal 'strength' reduces by a factor of 4.  You very quickly end up in a situation where you can detect <em>something</em> but not actually send any real information; the received signal is just too weak.</p>
<p>Wifi devices are also limited in power by FCC regulation in the US, other countries have similar restrictions.  It's technically possible to build a device that could have a useful range much longer than normal by jacking up the power but you'd adversely affect everyone in the vicinity who view you as an extremely powerful source of noise.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you were to replace the antenna by something <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41knJU42aIL.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> the effective range can be much longer with the restriction that the antennas point directly at each other.  A mile or more isn't uncommon for purpose-built point-to-point systems.</p>
<p>If you want extreme range but realistic amount of coverage you pair such a point-to-point link with a general-purpose router to &quot;rebroadcast&quot; the signal in all directions around the destination.</p>
<hr />
<p>e: Meant omnidirectional, not isotropic.  The description is also technically wrong because it's only equally-well in one plane and messes with the <code>r^2</code> distance but I think that detail needlessly complicates the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to a phenomenon called Path loss or path attenuation.
Attenuation is the gradual loss in intensity of any kind of flux through a medium.</p>
<p>What is means is that basically as waves travel the energy the wave has is absorbed by the medium (in this case air). Another factor is that the waves start to slightly expand and start losing energy. </p>
<p>The path loss factor is calculated by 20 x log 10 x 4pi d / lambda. </p>
<p>As you can see lambda (wavelength) and path loss are inversely proportional. That means lower the wavelength bigger the attenuation.
Wifis operate at 2.4 GHz which is a very low wavelength compared to Radio station that operate at Mhz. Note: wavelength and frequency are inverses of each other. This means that you can get radio signals for kilometers even without amplifications where as Wifis  has a range of about 100 feet.</p>
<p>The reason wifi has such a high frequency is that with high frequency you can offer better data speed.
That's why 4G LTE which is like 1.7GHz is so much faster than 3G which is around 900MHz. But that also means you'll lose 4G signal quicker.</p>
<p>Edit: Correction, Wifi is low wavelength (in context of the answer)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, they just diminish in intensity over distance like every other radiating source.</p>
<p>If you use a directional antenna at both ends you can use exactly the same equipment to create a link that goes up to several kilometers. And indeed this is something that is fairly commonly done as a method for providing broadband internet to locations without fiber or land lines that can support other options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How far can you understand somebody? How far if they shout? </p>
<p>With wi-fi it's the same basic principle. The farther the em-waves go, the &quot;quieter&quot; they become, until they are so &quot;quiet&quot; that your device can't hear them anymore (and can't shout back).</p>
<p>The shouting back part is infact the more intersesting one. You could turn your router as &quot;loud&quot; as you want, increasing the range by a good factor, but that will cost a lot of energy. Your mobile phone can't do that, as it is limited by the amout of power in it's battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
