		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood pressure cuffs register three states when they activate.</p>
<p>First, they inflate to full, closing off the artery completely. Then they deflate slowly until it detects that blood flow is resumed, the point where your blood pressure is greater than the pressure of the cuff is your Systolic Pressure. Then it deflates further until the blood vessels have expanded to full, and no longer vibrate the cuff. The remaining air pressure in the cuff is considered your Diastolic Pressure.</p>
<p>In short, it is mostly checking your arm for vibrations caused by the abnormal blood flow caused by squeezing the arteries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few answers have touched on the fact that vibrations are used to measure blood pressure, but there's a bit more to it.</p>
<p>Automatic non-invasive blood pressure cuffs are the ones that inflate, then slowly deflate. These are also called oscillometric devices, and consist of an air pump, an air bladder which compresses the artery being measured, and a sensor for measuring pressure in the air bladder.</p>
<p>On inflating, the blood pressure cuff occludes the artery, and the artery is unable to push on the air bladder in the BP cuff. The pressure sensor therefore traces a flat line at the pressure being delivered.</p>
<p>Slowly, air is let out and pressure in the air bladder decreases. Once it drops slightly below the peak arterial pressure, the artery is able to press on the air bladder and cause oscillations in the air bladder pressure trace. As further air is released these oscillations get bigger and finally smaller again, before becoming a flat line once the air bladder no longer presses on the artery. The pressure in the air bladder at all these points is recorded by the computer.</p>
<p>The optimal pressure of the air bladder against the artery - where the oscillations are biggest - is at the 'mean arterial pressure', which is the most accurate number that the non-invasive BP device gives us. The top (systolic) and bottom (diastolic) pressures are calculated by computer by looking at the pattern of the oscillation as the pressure changes in the cuff.</p>
