		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In practice, almost certainly no. The way sunlight generates some vitamin D in your skin is by causing a chemical reaction that converts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Dehydrocholesterol" target="_blank">7-Dehydrocholesterol</a> into Vitamin D3. However it's mainly only a high energy component of the solar spectrum, namely <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q3qDB07.jpg" target="_blank">UVB rays at a wavelength of 320-290nm</a> that can start the reaction.</p>
<p>Now the issue is that the UVB component is much stronger in sunlight than in a regular fire. The reason is that hot objects emit light with a profile called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">blackbody spectrum</a>. This profile will then depend on the temperature <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gLYtQzZ.png" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. Notice that the hotter the object, the more light it will emit at high energies (short wavelengths). The Sun acts like an effective blackbody at ~5550K so it has a decently strong component in the UV. On the other hand common fires that burn at ~1300K will only have a vanishingly small component in the UVB range. As a result you can sit in front of a fire until the cows get home and not get a benefit of Vitamin D production while a few minutes in sunlight is enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that the sun is nothing like a bonfire. A bonfire is a thermic reaction of wood, heat and oxygen. The sun doesn't actually burn, it undergoes nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, under intense heat and pressure, releasing radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/crnaruka pointed out, the fire would have to be hot enough to put out shortwave UV. A really hot hydrogen fire might do it... hydrogen fires are often called invisible because most of their spectrum is UV. The space shuttle main engines could give you vitamin D, but I wouldn't recommend standing close enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need a hot fire -- not a large fire -- to make ultraviolet light. So a small magnesium fire would be better than a giant bonfire. Technically, a large bonfire would produce  enough UV due to the blackbody spectrum, but it would also produce enough infrared that you couldn't stand near enough to get it without dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could probably get some vitamin D from a specialized flame, like acetylene, or incandescence from a ceramic catalyst such as a camp stove mantle. These can burn energetically enough to emit skin penetrating photons. Since you question was about ‘fire’, a rather general term, it would have to include these more energetic combustions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
