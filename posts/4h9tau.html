		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't even know until recently that for at least a decade there has been something of a controversy over whether the effects of anti-depressant medications on depression can be chalked up entirely to placebo or not, sparked mainly by work by Irving Kirsch who seems to be on a bit of a crusade against anti-depressants. I had taken it for granted until now that obviously they must have some active effect.</p>
<p>I've tried to make sense of the controversy by reading what I can of Kirsch and the responses but a lot of it goes over my head. It seems like it's generally acknowledged that anti-depressants usually have a very modest effect except in extreme cases where they can have a serious effect? It's hard for me to find much actual sources on this to read however which are not the standard stuff about the evils of big pharma trying to poison our brains.</p></div></div>
