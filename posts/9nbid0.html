Most recently, governor McMaster of South Carolina declared a state of emergency in anticipation of hurricane Michael. I’m just wondering, what does that actually do? Simply raise awareness of the disaster? Does anything more practical happen automatically as a result? Government buildings, schools close, etc? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A state of emergency waives some legal procedures and requirements that would otherwise prevent the government from quickly stepping in to help affected areas.  In addition, a state of emergency can be used to effectively rapidly inact temporary &quot;laws&quot; that otherwise would not be permissable or contradict existing laws.</p>
<p>For example, contractors may be called in to assist cleanup/rebuilding important infrastructure bypassing the competitive bidding process (which is a massive time sink, see the i85 bridge collapse in Atlanta as an example), and the state government can call in federal millitary for assistance if needed.</p>
<p>In effect, declaring a state of emergency typically grants the state/local executive branch of government a lot of powers it normally wouldn't, as the interest of the public demands rapid action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Declaring a state of emergency can do several things. The three most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opens a part of the budget that is normally &quot;locked up&quot; for use in major emergencies. The state or country usually firewalls part of the budget specifically for major events like a hurricane or fire or whatever; and declaring a state of emergency &quot;unlocks&quot; that part of the budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It changes the structure of emergency response crews. Normally,  each city/county/municipality has its own fire crew, ambulance, search and rescue, etc; each with their own jurisdiction, their own cheif, tax base, etc. A state of emergency overrides those normal bounds and allows a regional director to be appointed who can combine all those units into one meta-unit that can work anywhere within the affected area without having to go through the normal requests and approval and whatnot that would be required for cross-jurisdictional works under normal conditions. This can also empower the coordinator to include state or federal personnel from outside the affected area [example: call in the National Guard, or bring in a fire crew from another state].</p>
</li>
<li>A state of emergency can allow for temporary changes to the uses of public infrastructure; for example, school can be cancelled and the buildings used as emergency shelters. A church or stadium may be asked to serve as a shelter or control-center. Roads may be closed, or one-ways may be reversed, or a street designated &quot;for emergency vehicles only
&quot;, or whatnot. An airport may be closed to commercial use, but could be allowed to land airplanes bringing emergency supplies. Helicopters may be allowed to fly/land in areas where local laws would normally not allow. Etc. This also expands to include the contractor-bidding example someone else listed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a state of emergency the goal is to fix the problem faster than the normal process would allow for with any resources that can be made available. If there are difficulties, you note them and keep working to fix the problem; that instead of taking months or years to do it &quot;right&quot; the first time. Then once things have settled down, you have a big meeting and work out what can be done better the next time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many other reasons, but one reason is that declaring a state of emergency at the state level gives the state governor authority to activate national guard units to assist with the emergency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will depend a lot on the local emergency management plan.  Many times, initiating a state of emergency will empower the governor to request federal aid whether it be money, personnel, or both.  Also, he or she will be empowered to commit resources that may otherwise require approval from the house of delegates, etc.  Refer to emergency plan of your state for specifics. Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It allows for more efficient call-up of resources, such as allowing national guard to be utilized and equipment borrowed by local first responders, approvals for overtime, approvals of requisitions for equipment and materials, facilitates aid and loans for rebuilding</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
