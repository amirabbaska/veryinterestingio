		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have already pointed out, Twitter is an expensive operation. I want to drill down on one specific aspect of its operations.</p>
<p>If you talked to anyone at Twitter, they would actually tell you that they made a net profit this last quarter:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Q4 GAAP net loss of $167 million and <strong>non-GAAP net income of $119 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>^(<em>- from their SEC filings, emphasis mine</em>)</p>
<p>That's quite a big difference! What is this GAAP and non-GAAP business and why does it give such wildly different profit models?</p>
<p>Herein lies one of the costliest aspect of Twitter's operation: <strong>employee retention</strong>. This is a well-known secret within the tech industry, and it is somewhat peculiar that a (relatively, by the tech standard) mature company has to spend so much money to keep a reasonable tenure rate that it's pushing their profit margins into the black hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>GAAP vs OLD NAVY</strong></p>
<p>GAAP and non-GAAP are two different accounting models that the CFO and his analysts use to compile Twitter's financials. In simple terms, GAAP is the model that the security exchange wants, and the non-GAAP model basically takes some of the expenses of running Twitter, and reasons that they are &quot;self-reinvesting&quot; enough that they shouldn't be accounted for as an expense altogether.</p>
<p>For Twitter, their non-GAAP trick is to magically erase the impact of &quot;Stock-based compensation expense&quot; and &quot;restructuring changes&quot;. In other words, they don't believe that their accountants should really care about what they have to pay their employees to show up everyday because that's not really reflective of whether they will succeed.</p>
<p>Of course, this raises several questions.</p>
<p><strong>Why would anyone care about the no-compensation model in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Compensation is as much of a cost of operations as RnD, servers, physical assets, or a host of other expenses required to keep Twitter chugging along. This is obviously the opinion of the SEC as well, so why does Twitter even think it can get away with reporting a, quote, &quot;non-GAAP net income of $119 million&quot;?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there is some precedence for evaluating a company's <em>potential</em> even when they are not profitable. For many early companies, shelling out for good talent from time to time (or during growth sprees) isn't really an ominous thing. Nevertheless, standard accounting of their financials would lead your shareholders to believe that, because Foofle brought on an expensive director this year, its profit suffered. For healthy companies, excluding these expenses actually can give shareholders more clarity on the long-term direction of their company.</p>
<p>So far everything seems reasonable, but there's more to Twitter than meets the eye.</p>
<p><strong>Why are Twitter's financials peculiar?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's actually not that difficult to answer. Including both stock compensation and restructuring fees, Twitter spends around $240m to make sure that their employees keep coming into work every morning. With a total revenue of $700m, that's over a third of its total revenue! (For reference, Facebook, who pays the third most to retain employees, only pays out 15% of their total revenue) No other comparable companies in that vertical, or even in tech in general, spends that much to keep their employees.</p>
<p>Why is Twitter having trouble here? Well, the fact of the matter is, the RSUs (stock units/shares in Twitter) that the company grants to its employers is losing value every quarter. If you look at the historical price per share since Twitter went public, it's been dipping monotonically. As a result, the shares that were granted to an employee is only worth a fraction of the prices that they are worth when they were granted. (Some of this depends on the technicality of how those shares vest/when they can be sold).</p>
<p>Obviously, people are generally not very happy when they are holding what appears to be a depreciating asset. As a result, to keep their employees happy, Twitter will re-issue refresher stocks each year to compensate for the depreciation in the value of their equity, as well as a bit extra as a bonus (probably).</p>
<p>So what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Nothing. It's just that Twitter's performing so poorly that, to keep their compensation competitive, they're actually eating up a third of its revenue in order to keep their engineers, their strategist, and their other employees happy.</p>
<p>But there's some good news for Twitter at least. This percentage of total revenue that goes towards employee retention is declining every year (it was about 50% back in 2014). For the most part, this is mostly due to increasing revenue. However, if they become GAAP profitable and beat earnings, their stock prices will probably go up. At that point, their employees stocks will suddenly become an appreciating asset. As a result, they'll probably also stop bleeding so much money out to compensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The big thing to look at in these huge companies in base user growth, and daily/monthly users which is usually why its also reported in their earnings statements. This can help show investors, &quot;yeah we lost $150m but we gained 5m users this quarter and are set to lose less or profit next quarter/year/century&quot; </p>
<p>That or they're just hemorrhaging money and we could be looking at a BK in a few years </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The revenue is the total amount of money made by the business BEFORE the costs are put into the equation. Things that they could be spending money on: Research and development, Employee salaries, server maintenance, garden gnomes , merger/acquisition ( buying smaller companies), Debt ( companies borrow huge amounts of money to grow themselves)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most of the expenses are likely from not only the servers that run Twitter, but the back ups of the servers as well. In addition, you would need an IT staff around the clock to be able to put out any fires before they have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Twitter whole purpose is to allow people to post thoughts and weblinks, etc. immediately.  In other words, twitter being down would completely unacceptable, otherwise you'll lose business as people will go to other social media platforms to post their items and ad revenues would decrease as companies would spend money elsewhere.  So they are losing money still, but if their reliability is compromised, they would likely be hemorrhaging money even further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
