		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One large benefit to this is to measure if someone is actually engaging with your content on a page. When a person lands on your page, then leaves without interacting with anything, many analytics libraries will consider that a bounce, even if the user reads some or all of the content.  However, if they click something, that's considered an action, and that graduates you to a non bounce visitor - you didn't just land on the page and navigate away, you expressed interest in the content. This lets you do  content optimization - if you are getting a lot of non bounce visitors on certain pieces of content, you can promote that content more heavily, which in turn leads to more visitors to your site, as opposed to content that causes people to bounce which should be promoted less.</p>
<p>Other answers mention bandwidth conservation which may be a factor as well.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since a lot of comments are talking about ads I will amend my answer to address that as well. My answer alludes to the fact that with content optimization, if you can drive more people to your site, more ads are served which can increase ad revenue. There are a lot of payment models for ads, but generally, you might get paid a very small amount for an impression (which is just loading and showing an ad on your site), but you will get paid a lot more if someone actually clicks the ad and follows through to the content behind it (as such, the companies that are paying for the ads also pay per impression and per click, and clicks are much more expensive - there's a common metric called &quot;cost per click&quot; which measures how much you are paying for each click, so you can assess your return on investment). </p>
<p>With the 'continue reading' button, you could slap more ads below, but (and I'm speculating here) I'd expect if that 'continue reading' button was not there the ad would be there regardless. As such, I'm not certain it'd be a factor in generating more ad revenue, if you didn't have the 'continue reading', you'd get the impression and possible click as soon as the user viewed the ad (which would require one less click). The only counter argument to this I can think of is if ad serving companies require user interaction before you display more ads - but I don't know if that's true. </p>
<p>I also found this asked on stackexchange that had a few other good reasons as well: <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/82914/whats-the-point-of-a-read-full-story-button" target="_blank">https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/82914/whats-the-point-of-a-read-full-story-button</a></p>
<p>EDIT 2: A number of people are citing a lot of extra reasons below that can all be valid as well. This is not the end-all-be-all answer, which is why I said &quot;one large benefit&quot; to talk about how this is one of many. There are a ton of different reasons to design your content to have this - my example is just the most common one I've seen, but world of web advertising is very complex, with ad providers imposing rules and rapid policy changes as sites try to optimize their ad revenue within those rules! This is a simple question with a myriad of complex possible answers - I just gave one :).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a very specific reason for the &quot;read more&quot; being added to content sites - it happened around 3 years ago.</p>
<p>In 2014, one of the single largest global buyers of digital advertising, GroupM, made the decision to stop buying non-viewable ad inventory, because they felt it was a waste. <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/229401/real-time-with-groupms-ari-bluman.html" target="_blank">Here's an interview discussing what drove that change</a>.</p>
<p>By adding &quot;read more&quot;, inventory that was previously below the fold (so non viewable) became viewable, and therefore could be sold to major brand advertisers that were purchasing it on the exchanges, via companies like GroupM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A way to track popularity of the article.</p>
<p>If they just count the number of people that access an article then they would count people who clicked wrong and didn't read the article.</p>
<p>Also, they want to filter out people who don't read past the first paragraph or two.</p>
<p>This metric is much more accurate about how popular the article is.</p>
<p>And can give information, when compared to total accesses, about how poorly their site is designed by identifying number of miss-clicks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
