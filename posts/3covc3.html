		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>where do you buy apples older than12 months?I can understand a 10 month old apple that gets sold shortly before season but having apples sold with an <strong>average</strong> age of 14 months (so some 2 months and some 26 months old) is economically unviable. It costs to store it, the storage should be empty by the time the next harvest is ripe.</p>
<p>did the podcast maybe say <em>up to 14 months old</em>?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it is kept in cold storage it has been treated with 1-MCP (methylcyclopropene), sprayed with wax and kept in a high CO2, low O2 environment. This keeps the apples from maturing. Before it gets to the grocery stores, the wax is removed and once it sits on the shelf, the atmosphere is back to normal breathable conditions and the fruit only has at most three weeks before it spoils. </p>
<p>Edit: a lot of people keep mentioning Nitrogen. The process to lower O2 is by backfilling nitrogen to get the Oxygen concentration down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is timed to be 'ripe' shortly after you buy it.</p>
<p>I put 'ripe' in quotes because I spent a season picking pineapples... we'd pick perfectly ripe pineapples, which would be canned within an hour of being picked (and then the labels from one company or another would be added, some of which had claims that their product was better than that of some other company we also canned for); -1 day ripe, which would be sent via airplane to locations all over the world; and 2 week pineapples that were just slightly yellowing but mostly still green.</p>
<p>Those last ones, 2 weeks shy of ripeness, would be sent to grocery stores everywhere in the world.  People buy them and set them on counters or window sills to &quot;ripen&quot;.  But once a fruit has been picked it no longer ripens; it just rots.  The mechanisms are completely different, a fruit ripened on the plant develops complex sugars, while fruit that 'ripens' off the plant breaks down into simple sugars in the exact same way all other living matter does.  (EDIT: ryanlam003 pointed out that the fruit's ripening mechanism <em>does</em> continue after picking; it's the loss of nutrient and water pathways from the parent plant that opens the door for decay.)  The difference is so strong that I haven't been able to eat pineapples bought from stores - they smell rotten, because they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apples will keep in standard cold storage (think: a cellar) for 3-5 months in &quot;edible&quot; condition, with regular maintenance (removal of any that go bad etc.)  &quot;Edible&quot; does not mean &quot;pristine&quot;.  </p>
<p>Suppliers artificially extend that window with climate control and chemistry.  By the time the apple reaches your grocery, it's well into its afterlife.  That's why you can't buy a bushel of apples (or onions, or potatos, or really any winter staple) at the store and keep them all season.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
