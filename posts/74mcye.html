<p>I can't find much about this since the Roman numerals throw Google off and I just get results for regular ice.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dU84T.png" target="_blank">here's the phase diagram</a>. At room temperature you'd need to raise the pressure to 1-2 GPa for Ice VI and above 2.1 GPa for Ice VII.</p>
<p>These are pressures a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell" target="_blank">Diamond Anvil Cell</a> can handle, for sure, but those are smaller than an ordinary ice cube, although still 'macroscopic' by chemical standards.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BARS_apparatus" target="_blank">BARS</a> type press used for HTHP diamond synthesis has a volume of a few cm^3 and goes up to 10 GPa, so that'd work. Given that you don't need high temperatures, building a similar press with a larger cavity that can go to even higher pressures at room temperature should be technically possible. </p>
<p>Chemical reactors built for extremely high pressures don't normally go that high. </p>
<p>So in summary my guess is that while it's most likely possible to create a normal-sized ice cube of ice VI in a lab, you'll have a hard time finding off-the-shelf equipment to do it with.</p>
<p>The resulting ice cube could certainly melt once you took it out into room pressure and temperature. I don't know offhand if the solid ice would stay Ice VI/VII as it melted, or transition to Ice I, or turn into some amorphous in-between structure. But transitions from one crystal structure to another tend to have very high activation barriers and thus proceed slowly (the classic example being how diamonds are in no rush to turn into the more stable graphite structure at atmospheric pressure)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice VI is stable at room temperature but is under enormous pressure. Its very unlikely to be stable at atmospheric pressure because it is the weak hydrogen bonds that would have to hold it together. It would likely melt, very quickly, possibly freezing into normal ice because of the sudden expansion ( it's about 1.4 g/cc). </p>
<p>Higher pressure still and you have ice VII. Which is slightly denser. However at atmospheric pressure this means the ice VII will phase change into ice VI... with an ensuing volume increase. This might seem small but the ice cube would likely shatter with the change into ice VI and <em>then</em> melt.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PS: I did the math, Hydraulic Press Channel has a 100 tonne press with a face diameter of about 10 cm, which works out to a maximum pressure of around 0.15 GPa.  So you need about 7 times more pressure to get to Ice VI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
