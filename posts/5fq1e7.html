		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You want to watch a video on your mobile device.  </p>
<p>Both New Startup Video Service (NSVS)  and Big Corp Video Service (BCVS) have the video.   </p>
<p>Your mobile data provider says - watching the video on BCVS does not count against your limited data plan, but watching anywhere else does.   </p>
<p>You'll end up only using BCVS.  Consumers are incredibly price-driven.   After a few data overages, they'll stick to the free sites.    They'll avoid the small startup sites which drain precious limited bytes of your data plan - or they'll effectively have to pay to view non-approved content.</p>
<p>This provides a strong competitive advantage for large established companies - they can use the power of the purse to discourage you from visiting their competitor.  Only large, rich companies will be able to afford the payoff to ISP to have their service carried &quot;free&quot; on their Internet.  </p>
<p>Apply this concept your home ISP.  The entire Internet is now divided into what your Big Corp ISP says you can access for free, the rest is effectively subject to their toll.  </p>
<p>Now, let's have BigCorp ISP give everyone FREE internet - especially for the poor who cannot afford Internet.  Wait... only approved sites and services are free - if you go elsewhere, please provide credit card.   </p>
<p>Rather than people freely accessing the entirety of whats on the Internet, people will stick to the limited view of what's &quot;free&quot; and &quot;approved&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:  If AT&amp;T gets to decide which content services you use, they own the Internet, and they own you.</p>
<p>Unlimited data is great.  But it has to apply to <strong><em>all</em></strong> data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Unlimited Streaming&quot;, from a limited number of content providers, is just a backwards way of selectively charging for content.  In other words AT&amp;T chooses what content they'll charge extra for by counting it against a data cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of this selective charging, customers will (nearly) always use content providers that won't potentially cost them extra on their AT&amp;T bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But in order to <strong><em>get</em></strong> that &quot;free&quot; streaming status, the content providers themselves must pay AT&amp;T (unless, of course, they happen to be owned by AT&amp;T).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This drives up the price of those content services, <strong><em>so customers end up paying extra anyway</em></strong>.  It's a devious way for AT&amp;T to ultimately take more money out of the customers' pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>But it also gives a huge competitive advantage to content providers owned by AT&amp;T, which in the long run, is a way for them to monopolize the internet, allowing them to charge customers even more for less.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It starts creating walled gardens of the internet. With a limited data cap, it hurts any streaming service that's not covered under their unlimited streaming plan. Why watch Netflix when Hulu doesn't use up data? With zero rating programs like this, it's like every <em>other</em> service is penalized.</p>
<p>Imagine if 10 companies did things like this. Now, any service who doesn't want to lose customers worried about a data cap has to negotiate and/or pay 10 different companies to compete equally. The idea of an open internet is that everything is treated the same. You shouldn't have to pay extra for a &quot;Youtube package&quot;; you should get equal access to everything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AT&amp;T is one of the largest carriers in the country and it is prioritizing it's own content over other companies'. T-Mobile was the first one to do the &quot;unlimited streaming&quot; think with TMobile One, but it did so (in theory) for any video/music provider that asked. Netflix, Hulu, etc could alter their stream to fit within TMBs technical limitations and take advantage. AT&amp;T is specifically saying &quot;DirecTV doesn't count against data&quot; because they own DirecTV and they are trying to use their userbase to leverage their other products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
