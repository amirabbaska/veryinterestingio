There's no &quot;Maybe if I complete the song instead of turning it off in between, it will stop.&quot; I guess we have to always make sure it's something we like.</p>
<p>It can be bad though, like when you are talking to people. They're telling about their petty, melodramatic life and you're zoning out thinking about that sick part you just heard, muttering the drum rudiment under your breath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the brain is like an echo chamber that can be filled with silent sounds. It is not electrically/mechanically perfect, and so there are little inklings of sound even when none really exists. And then you have the individual perceiving it all, shifting minute amounts of attention to this or that within the inklings... If you're familiar with a song that's even remotely similar to how the inklings fit into your perception, it can bubble all the way up into that song's chorus or bridge.</p>
<p>TLDR: you listen to so much pop music that even silence reminds you of songs you know</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally I do this to avoid thinking about, well, just about anything else.</p>
<p>Allowing a song to occupy the background of the mind limits the amount of random thoughts which can trigger anxiety and panic.</p>
<p>People who are less prone to being overly anxious seem to do this less often in my experience.</p>
<p>The Simpsons did a pretty good example of how different types can react to being alone with their thoughts: <a href="https://youtu.be/oFM1SiXgr8A" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/oFM1SiXgr8A</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most answers you get are probably from people who think you talk about ear worms, I had that problem at least when I tried to explain it in real life.</p>
<p>I've since been to a few neurologists, and they are all very interested as hearing music in your head truly 100% of the time seems to be very rare. I was offered to participate in some studies, but they all take at least 10 days an I can't really be bothered to disappear from life for over a week for basically nothing, as I was assured the condition is not dangerous (no tumour or anything). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
