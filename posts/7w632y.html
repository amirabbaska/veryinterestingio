		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Octopuses themselves depend on water to breathe, so in addition to being a cumbersome mode of transportation, the land crawl is a gamble. “If their skin stays moist they can get some gas exchange through it,” Wood notes. So in the salty spray of a coastal area they might be okay to crawl in the air for at least several minutes. But if faced with an expanse of dry rocks in the hot sun, they might not make it very far.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing that they breath through the same mechanism that allows their jet propulsion. They have an inlet and an outlet for this sack that they squeeze to whizz along.</p>
<p>When they're on land they seal off both ends holding water in thier lung (for lack of a better more accurate word) provided this water stays oxygenated they can breathe.
They're effectively holding their breath until they can get back into the water and a fresh supply of oxygenated water.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think to ask if they are in pain is to assume a lot about how their nervous system works.  What we do know of cephalopods is that while they do have some of the most sophisticated nervous systems among invertebrates with a decent sized central brain and more advanced sensory capabilities than most other seafaring creatures, we don't necessarily know in depth how responsive that system is to stimuli like temperature changes and exposure to air.  It is a difficult thing to equate to since they have such a different morphology.  For instance, you may know what it feels like to submerge yourself in water, but you can't assume it feels exactly the same for a dog - even though they likely feel most sensations fairly similarly, they are covered in a coat of fur which can significantly skew what that experience feels like.  Cephalopods have completely different types of limbs, a soft body structure, and a quite different style of skin.  It wouldn't make sense in such a soft form to experience stretching and pressure in the same way as mammals do.  Short of mapping various stimuli with MRI scans, anything we posited about how things feel would be purely speculative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let’s not forget the octopus that was leaving its tank every night at an aquarium, slithering fairly long distances to a large open water tank, killing and eating fish (valuable specimens to the aquarium, mind you) and then, the most amazing part of all, slithering BACK to its own tank to evade detection. </p>
<p>And it did this repeatedly until “caught.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, how much physical pain can really be involved?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
