		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question made me look up the physics of Newton's Cradles instead of working. Best kind of question.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that when balls 1 &amp; 2 strike ball 3, there are actually two collisions because there's always a very slight separation between the swinging balls. Ball 2 strikes 3, causing ball 5 to move, then after an imperceptible time, ball 1 strikes 2, causing ball 4 to move.</p>
<p>Assumption is that if you were to weld balls 1 &amp; 2 together forming a single unit with double the mass (alignment issues would mean they would have to swing on a single wire) then ball 5 would launch with double the velocity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all we had to concern ourselves with was conservation of momentum, it could easily do.just what you suggest.  Really it could create many different combinations of balls and speeds.</p>
<p>However in any collision there are two things conserved, momentum and energy.  Specifically in this type of collision all kinetic energy must be the same before and after.  If an equal mass is not sent flying at the end of this collision, then either energy or momentum is not conserved.</p>
<p>Math version for those interested:</p>
<p>KE1=KE2. (Kinetic energy is the same before and after the collision where no deformation occurs)
.5<em>m</em>v^2.     You asked what happens Masses if is 2 at the start, and 1 at the end.  Let's choose a speed of 2. And solve for our final speed.</p>
<p>0.5x2x2^2 = 0.5x1xV^2</p>
<p>4 = 0.5xV^2</p>
<p>Sqrt(8)=v</p>
<hr />
<p>Also p1=p2.  P=m*v</p>
<p>2x2 = 1xV</p>
<p>4=v</p>
<p>If we try this change in mass, we get two different speeds.  Conservation of energy states it is sqrt8, while conservation of momentum requires that the final speed is 4. As both statements must be true, this possibility does not happen.</p>
<p>Now if the collision has some deformation, or another way to store/transfer energy, the energy equation will be a bit different, and you can have a different mass ejected.  But that isn't true for a Newton's cradle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
