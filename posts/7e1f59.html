		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrous oxide does a few things.</p>
<p>It cools down the intake charge which makes it more dense. More density means more available oxygen.  Then under heat and pressure it breaks down into oxygen and nitrogen which makes more oxygen available for combustion. More oxygen means you can burn more fuel, more fuel burned means more power.</p>
<p>The breakdown of nitrous oxide is also exothermic, which further increases pressure on the combustion chamber, further increasing power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your engine produces power by combusting fuel. This combustion requires a specific ratio of fuel to oxygen. The ambient air going into your engine only has so much oxygen. If you provide too much fuel without increasing the oxygen level, you end up with incomplete combustion and less power is produced. This is called a rich mixture.</p>
<p>To make more power, nitrous oxide is added to increase the amount of oxygen beyond what the ambient air contains. With all of this extra oxygen, you are able to add and combust more fuel per cycle. When more fuel is combusted completely, you make more power.</p>
<p>TLDR: Nitrous oxide provides more oxygen. More oxygen means more fuel can be combusted. More fuel combusting means more power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrous Oxide is really just not as good in cars as movies make it seem, but it's probably still the best power per dollar <em>while active</em>.</p>
<p>A gasoline engine generates rotational energy through controlled combustion of air and fuel. If you <em>also</em> channel some compressed Nitrous Oxide into the air/fuel mixture, you can add more fuel and then make more power.</p>
<p>Nitrous Oxide supplies more oxygen and cools the intake charge. We don't use pure oxygen because it would literally be too explosive. Nitrous Oxide is composed of one molecule oxygen and two molecules of nitrogen. The nitrogen helps to control the burn, so it happens during ignition rather than before.</p>
<p>But this is a rather limited resource, so it's better suited to a drag strip than to a race track.</p>
<p>Edit: hydrogen -&gt; nitrogen, oops!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like everyone said.  Oxygen.  You need it to burn something.  IIRC a perfect mix of pump gas in your engine needs to be almost 15 parts air to 1 part fuel for a &quot;stoichiometric ratio.&quot; Or the perfect amount to burn everything out of the combustion chamber.  This burns really hot so it's better acrually to run a little rich so un burnt fuel is pushed out cooling the motor and exhaust on its way.<br />
Wanting to get more power, you need more air. So forced induction would do this.  And then you can add more fuel to make more power. But then as your pressure increases, regular pump fuel can't handle the compression without detonation before the spark plug fires.
Another way to add more power then is changing the fuel.  Oxygenated racing fuels and alcohol can lower the stoichiometric ratio to only 6:1. But Nitrous... having 2 oxygen molecules in it.  It's as low as 4:1. If I could have that ratio of waffles to syrup right now... that's a lot of syrup.  Or 3 - 4 times the fuel burning in your combustion chamber.  It'll probably separate a head from the block. But it's fun right up to that point.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NO decomposes into Nitrogen and Oxygen in high temperature.</p>
<p>An engine can only take so much air into a cylinder which limits the amount of oxygen available for burning fuel. The oxygen part of NO enriches the air and allows more fuel to be burned in the same volume of a cylinder.</p>
<p>Additionally, the single Nitrogen atoms combine into double-atom Nitrogen molecules. This binding reaction is very strongly exothermic - all that energy is released as heat. This acts as an additional source of energy and doesn't even require any oxygen. </p>
<p>This very reaction (combining single N atoms into N2 molecules) also creates the bulk of energy in most of conventional explosives, that's how strong it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
