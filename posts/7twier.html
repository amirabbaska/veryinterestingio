		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They basically just keep track of how much energy they provided to the communal grid, and how much their customers drew from the communal grid.  They can produce it at a certain price, and prove their customers drew that power out the other side, so it doesn't really matter where the specific electrons came from as long as they provided enough for their customers' use.  Make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you and your roommate agree to keep 99 bottles of beer on the wall at all times. You take one down, and pass it to your friend, so now there's 98 bottles of beer on the wall. This means you need to put a bottle of beer back on the wall to bring it back to 99. The only rule is you have to keep 99 bottles of beer on the wall. Nothing is said about it being coors light or a good stout.</p>
<p>Same way, every energy producer will have different costs to produce energy, solar, hydro-electric, geo-thermal, wind, natural gas, coal, nuclear and so on. But the system doesn't care about that, the only thing the system cares about is they have to put 1 unit of energy for every unit of energy they sell. </p>
<p>Maybe the power company you buy from sells only solar power, but it's the middle of the night, so maybe they'll pay another company to generate it for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy supply companies you pay are just resellers or middlemen. They buy and sell contracts for future supply from the energy wholesale market that coal / oil / gas suppliers provide. The big 6 supply companies have large costs and crap computer systems. So every so often someone comes along and decides that they can run a billing system with lower costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generators bid in to the electrical market.</p>
<p>If generator A is really cheap to run, they may bid in at $10; so, if the price of electricity is greater than $10, generator A will produce electricity. Generator B may be more expensive, and bid in at $20. When the price rises to $20, generator B gets turned on. When the price of electricity goes back to $15, generator B gets turned off again, but generator A stays on. </p>
<p>The key, however, is that everyone gets paid the current price of electricity; even though generator A bid in at $10, they got paid $20 when the price reached $20. This means that they got the same amount as generator B per amount of electricity produced for all the hours in which generator B was producing, but they got to produce more, and therefore got paid more. So, its in everyone's best interest to bid in as cheaply as possible for them, creating competition.</p>
<p>Different generators also have different characteristics. Nuclear plants are very cheap to run for the amount of energy they generate, but really, really don't want to ever change their output. Oil generators, on the other hand, are very expensive, but can change their electrical output very quickly, to respond to minute to minute differences in electrical demand. Since supply and demand always need to be matched in a functioning electric grid, the ability to change output quickly can be very valuable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
