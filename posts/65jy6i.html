		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the Venus Fly Trap (VFT) seals up when something is inside of it, creating a pocket. It then fills that pocket with acidic digestive juices (essentially creating a stomach).</p>
<p>The acidic juices aren't strong enough to destroy chitin (the harder exoskeleton), but it is strong enough to deteriorate the connective tissue between the chitin - like in leg sockets or in spots between body segments (thorax and abdomen). Then the acid gets inside the guts of the bug, liquefying it. </p>
<p>Once the bug's insides have been liquefied, the flytrap absorbs the nutrients/digestive juices within the pocket. When the trap re-opens (if it does... most traps can  be activated 3-5 times before the trap self destructs), the chitinous husk of the last meal is leftover. This husk can attract spiders or other bugs looking for a meal, serving as bait in a way.</p>
<p>When it comes to the finger issue, there's a few problems. VFT traps are activated by triggering a certain amount of hairs. Even then, after the trap closes, the prey item has to keep triggering the hairs, which indicates that prey is inside the pocket, signalling the trap to fully seal itself up and begin filling with acidic juices. In the instance you just put your finger in a normal size trap, it would probably close, realize its prey item is too big since it can't fully seal itself up, and then release you. </p>
<p>Now, in the instance you fell into a man-size VFT, and it closed around you, sealing you up inside, and you continued to struggle and try to get out instead of sit very still as to not agitate the trigger hairs (which would release you, as the trap would think it did not actually catch you. Bugs are too stupid to not resist, we are not), the plant would seal itself up and become air-tight. Before any acidic juices are released, you asphyxiate within the trap from lack of oxygen (most likely), or you will drown in the juices when the pocket fills up with acid. You probably won't feel being burned alive - it takes the VFT a few days to fully digest a bug, so I imagine if it were the same for humans, you'd be dead due to asphyxiation long before you felt any burning sensations. </p>
<p>Probably TMI for ELI5, but I've been raising VFT for close to 15 years now, and have studied them quite a bit. Also, as a note, don't feed your VFT meat. They don't like it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same thing as what everyone else is saying except you can easily remove your finger from a Venus fly trap. There are also many different species of Venus fly trap and some get big enough that you feed mice to. The really nice thing is that they're super easy to look after. Because they eat meat for nutrition, you don't have to water them</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
