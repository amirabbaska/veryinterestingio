<p>I believe there were also some instances of it being rigged in some states so their concern isn't completely unwarranted</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thay actually depends on the state in which they won.  Most states require the winner to be identified as a security precaution; the winner has to be named to prove that the drawing wasn't rigged. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it is.</p>
<p>Other times, the winner might want the attention/fame that comes with their identity being public, often giving an interview for a newspaper, site or show.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the lottery requires their identity be public as a condition of receiving the money. It “proves” to potential players that the game is winnable, and encourages them to play. The legality of this varies by area and game— an extreme example is the publisher’s clearing house which is a marketing company that makes money in other ways than selling lottery/sweepstakes entries. Giving money away is 100% for attention and public image, not directly generating revenue, for that company. Naming the winners publicly is part of that system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's great marketing for the lottery to show the winners, it also provides an easier to see audit (some bloke won) than the actual records.  In most of the US, there hasn't been enough cases of something terrible happening to the winner to offset the benefits to the state of publicizing them.  </p>
<p>A few states allow anonymity or lottery winnings to be claimed by a trust (which protects the privacy of the winner).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some places their identities can remain secret, but in most US states they can't.</p>
<p>The reason is this: The state is collecting money, and then paying it out. If they don't announce the winner, how do you know it's not going to the lottery director's brother or the governor's cousin? Well, you don't, of course, which is why in most states government disbursements are, by law, public record.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
