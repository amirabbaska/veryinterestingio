<p>We are in a warm period of that ice age called an interglacial period, which is why it isn't as cold as you think of an ice age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned below, the main cause of these big swings in climate are <a href="http://climatica.org.uk/climate-science-information/long-term-climate-change-milankovitch-cycles" target="_blank">Milankovitch Cycles</a>. The first-order parameters which govern how warm cold we are are either external or internal. Externally, the energy the Earth receives from the sun can vary because of (1) the sun's energy increases/decreases - the sunspot cycle; or (2) our position relative to the sun changes. As mentioned below, this is a mix of our axis angle, how wobbly the Earth's spin is, and how circulate or elliptical our orbit is. Together these change how much energy the poles get, especially the north pole. As a result, longer colder winters allow snow to fall, not melt, and glaciers to form and grow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There's a difference as well between ice age and glacials. Some people think that they're synonymous, but often Ice Age refers to the Pleistocene, a period in which lots of glacial-interglacial cycles have occurred. Using the term glacial or interglacial is the best way around this for what you mean. They cycles of glacial - interglacial - glacial used to occur every 40,000 years, but more recently have occurred every 100,000 years. This includes cooling, full glacial conditions, and a warming to the conditions we see now - an interglacial.</p>
<p>The last glacial maximum - when ice covered much of Canada/N America, Scandinavia etc peaked about 25,000 years ago, followed by warming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An ice age is occuring whenever the Earth has large glaciers covering its surface. So with the Artic and Antarctic frozen over we are in fact in an ice age right now. During an ice age, the climate swings between glaciation periods and warmer intermediary periods. We left the latest glaciation period roughly 12,500-10,000 years ago and are now in an warmer interglacial period.</p>
<p>Due mainly to changes in the Earth oribt, called Milankovitch Cycles, we could expect to enter a new glacial period in roughly 10,000 years. However, due to human caused global warming, it seems ever more likely that we might actually cancel not only the next glaciation period, but the ice age as a whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mean glacial periods.  The best theory i know if is based on the Milankovitch cycles, which are astronomical cycles of the Earth's angle of obliquity, orbital eccentricity, and precession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>The idea is that a glacial period starts when insolation (energy received from the Sun) at 65째 North is at a minimum, and that interglacial periods begin when insolation at 65째 North reaches a maximum.</p>
<p>For example, precession of the equinoxes means that every 12,500 years or so the hemisphere whose singer coincides with perigee flip.  So every 25,000 we have one insolation maximum at 65째 North and so on.  (Glacial periods typically last three equinox precession cycles.  Interglacial periods typically last about half an equinox precession cycle.  The other cycles are involved.  Also, these aren't very smooth cycles, as there are lots of interactions with Jupiter making them non-linear.)</p>
<p>Now, why 65째 North?  Because there is more landmass in the northern hemisphere.  Ice that accumulates on the sea can move and melt if it moves towards the equator, but ice on land does not.  So if  land ice accumulates all year long - that is, if it doesn't melt in the spring! - then it will accumulate more, and here comes the killer point: once you have land ice year-long... the Earth gets shinier (albedo goes up) and reflects more of the Sun's light, thus making it colder.</p>
<p>The vicious cycle of ice accumulation ends in massive drought, which causes less precipitation, so less ice accumulates.  Eventually, during an insolation maximum, ice begins melting in the spring and summer, the cycle reverses, and we get a virtuous cycle that warms up the Earth and speeds up the melting.</p>
<p>It's been like thus for a couple million years, but the particular cycle lengths and patterns have changed.</p>
<p>FYI, we're just about due, if not overdue, for a glacial period.  This has been a long interglacial period, but not so long that it must be one of the log ones.  There have been two interglacial periods in the last 700ky that lasted closer to 50ky than the more typical 12ky - 18ky.  We night get lucky and miss a glacial period right now.</p>
<p>As i understand it, glacial periods set in very quickly.  It takes thousands of years for ice to get a mile thick in New York, but only a few hundred for glacial weather patterns to set in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several contributing processes, some periodic and some not. This is why ice ages differ in severity, and have glacial and inter-glacial periods as these various processes are in and out of sync. I've seen others mention volcanism as well as changes in ocean current patterns. Sunspot cycles affect the amount of radiation (energy that becomes heat) that reaches earth, and therefore contribute to ice age patterns as well. More notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">Milankovitch Cycles</a> describe periodic changes in earth's axial tilt and orbital eccentricity, which affect the amount of solar energy that penetrates our atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the composition of our atmosphere can affect the severity of all other causes of earth's climate cycles, because certain gasses are more effective at retaining solar energy. Anthropogenic CO2 is interrupting an existing ice age right now, and unambiguously causing global average temperatures to increase at an absolutely unprecedented rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
