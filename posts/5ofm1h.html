		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I put a year of effort to recover from bad posture, I do agree with many of the things said but one important thing is missing and it plays a big part in why it isnt actually more comfortable, but sorta is.</p>
<p>When you start with bad posture it suddenly becomes difficult/tiring to support yourself as the muscles have to work harder to hold shape (excaserbated by school, job / long sitting etc).  This mean you naturally move towards that extreme slouch / worst positions where as others have said your joints / ligaments take the stress and muscles do less, so it feels &quot;easier&quot; and &quot;more comfortable&quot; because its no longer difficult.</p>
<p>When you are in those positions over time your muscles loosen or tighten in places to accommodate / reach neutral positions.  For example,  slouching, the muscles in your chest and front of shoulders tighten up and your ones in your back loosen / stretch.</p>
<p>If you then try to have &quot;correct&quot; posture, i.e. pull your shoulders back a bit, stand up more etc you then have to fight the bad form of the muscles, i.e. your back muscles are weak and have to work harder to expand those tight chest muscles which dont like to be stretched.</p>
<p>This makes having &quot;correct&quot; posture hard and painful, which is then why bad posture / those extremes feel comfortable.</p>
<p>So the real way to correct bad posture is with stretching and strengthening.  I.e. stretching chest muscles every day, strengthening back muscles to tighten them up.  Essentially developing good core strength / form.  There are specific stretches  and exercises, or things like pilates or yoga are great -- but it takes a good 6 months or a year of regular activity to make actual real good progress</p>
<p>If you fix the muscles they will start to pull your spine etc into shape and then your skeletoncan start supporting itself.</p>
<p>So yeah long story short,  good posture should be easy if you break into a back habit it quickly becomes hard and your body adapts then to the bad posture.</p>
<p>Something worth mentioning here is Alexander Technique.  Word of caution I think there are many good lessons in it but some (bad) teachers on the extreme take it to the point of almost faith healing ailments.</p>
<p>Frederick Alexander was a public speaker and I believe did some Shakespearean acting in the 1890's but no amplification in them days so had to project voice loudly.  And basically voice started to suffer, weakened, hoarse, out of breath and along with it back pain etc.</p>
<p>So he spoke to doctors and there was no reason they could find, i.e. his throat looked fine.  So he made the assumption its his speaking / the way he was doing that was wrong.</p>
<p>He then stood in front of a bunch of mirrors and analysed what he looked like when he was speaking, noticed he was bending his neck and slouching.  With the mirrors he set out with practice to correct that, and lo and behold, his voice came back full and strong.</p>
<p>He then studied this more and studied other people with issues, sportsmen etc and noticed more things about how posture can affect performance of the body.  Basically then wrote a book about it and taught it.</p>
<p>I think its really good as its a thorough study into posture, and more importantly, movement. </p>
<p>A hopefully obvious example is sitting.  When sitting you need to lean forward, bend kness and plant bum on seat, sounds easy, not so much...</p>
<p>A common thing there is most people when they sit as I did seem to fix there eye line, so as you sit your head crinks backwards as your body moves forward, this puts all sorts of tension on your neck.</p>
<p>Where its gone bad though is some people then have taken this on as a one size fit all &quot;cure&quot; for back pain/hypertension etc and its not.   Take it as a detailed study into posture and movement and there are definitly things in here that can help / promote good practice and in many cases can actually help reduce / fix back pain / chronic pain. </p>
<p>Its helped understand my posture which getting that good has helped my relieve tightness across my chest, my singing and my back/neck pain from a car accident / whiplash injury.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little off topic but personal trainer here: The fastest possible way to correct posture (in my experience, and for a HEALTHY, uninjured, non-senior individual) is to skip stretching and instead implement functional strength building moves with proper form. </p>
<p>I am not saying stretching isn't beneficial but I myself spent 5+ months stretching to rehab an injury and avoiding what I knew would work best because the chiropractor advised stretching instead and I found that almost immediately after focusing on strength my posture returned to normal, whereas stretching and lighter physical therapy exercises provided almost no results for months. </p>
<p>The key factor here is I am young, fit and not injured / senile. This will not work if you have injuries or are an older person but if you're healthy give it a shot. By strength building functional moves I mean compound barbell or dumbbell exercises and TRX is amazing for upper body posture as well. Some exercises that are general basics are the barbell squat, barbell deadlift, dumbbell or barbell Bench and row, and my personal favorite for upper body posture : TRX row or TRX facepull. Please google the form and make sure it's correct!</p>
<p>Edit edit: just dropping this here, I'm not an expert so don't take my advice as such. I'm also 23, hiker, rock climber, snowboarder and been working out for a decade. I know my body extremely well in and out. I can assure you 100% without a doubt stretching didn't do jack shit for me and never will. Also consider my fitness level, I'm not against stretching I'm just saying for fit athletic individuals such as myself who may have postural issues I have found quicker and more efficient success from strength training than I have stretching. Stretching has numerous benefits and I'm not knocking this at all I'm just saying personally for me (and those of similar athletic builds) that stretching was far inferior and far slower than straight up weights and strength building!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Gonzotronic has it right.</p>
<p>It comes down to energy and efficiency. Using our muscles takes energy and work. If we're in a position where muscles aren't working, less energy is being used.</p>
<p>Slouching is the best example. You're essentially just relaxing the muscles of your spine and trunk until most of the weight/pressure is being held by ligaments and joints (or leaning on your arm, etc). </p>
<p>It's also why people default to lifting with a bent back. We know the dangers to our lower back in doing this yet it's more energy efficient as it uses less muscle.</p>
<p>The second part of the question - why are these the worst positions? When we're in one position for a long time our tissue undergoes &quot;creep&quot; in the same way silly putty would if we held it in the air and let it fall (although much more slowly). Things slowly stretch out (ligaments, joints) and can cause discomfort as well as trigger our muscles (remember they're meant to take pressure off these tissues) to reflexively tighten to protect the now compressed or stretched ligaments and joints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean mostly your back? If so no one has addressed the elephant in the room. </p>
<p>Our general spine design was forged in the evolutionary fires eons ago, and that design was for supporting ourselves on four legs. It's not something that's easily changed. Despite that fact that we started our path to walking on two legs millions of years ago, our bodies have not yet evolved a way for walking upright to not totally fuck up our backs, eventually. </p>
<p>Think of the spine as a chain, meant to be suspended between the two poles of your shoulders and hips. Most of the force of gravity---particularly as you move---would go into your limbs that way. But since we walk upright, we're taking that chain and pretending it's a solid and rigid flagpole. Every moment you spend upright is crushing it in a direction it was never meant to be crushed.</p>
<p>Our muscles are constantly working to prevent this as much as possible, so relaxing them feels good. But the muscles being tense is what's preventing the links in your chain from collapsing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to have lower back pain. Tried every medication and exercise. Nothing worked, Then I developed my own solutions:-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you wish to ease your lower back pain, practice to sleep with a thin pillow between your legs. Also take a near foetal position, not a hard one, but whatever degree of curling makes you comfortable. </p>
</li>
<li>Another hack. You can also try to lie on the floor on your back and then set your lower legs on a chair seat ( horizontal) which will make your thighs ( vertical). Adjust yourselves into the most comfortable position. This will take the strain off your back muscles and backbone. You can sleep in this position throughout the night. You may have to spend a little time and money in finding a chair with the exact height to suit your leg length.</li>
