		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about government is that it has to be slow to adopt these technologies to function well as they have to be able to server literally everyone, not just most. There are plenty of people that don't have smart phones but still drive, or don't have internet and drive. We know the current license and registration system works, why change it? Additionally something like a driver's license has to be somewhat immune to fakes, I'm not sure there's a good solution that would work on a phone. Additionally many people would have reservations about giving their phones to police, notice the uproar over customs agents asking for people to unlock their phones so they can poke around?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual cop here when I ask for license and registration ti'm really asking for each for a different purpose. I ask for your license because a lot of times the driver isn't the registered owner of the car.  Sure I can look it up by name/dob, but the card lets me compare faces right there. You can give me someone's name/dob that looks super similar to you, and get away with it. Most fake IDs are easy as hell to spot. Once I get someone's license I don't even bother to look at the dates on it, I just run their license number through NCIC to make sure it is valid.</p>
<p>I ask for registration for the sole purpose of showing people their shit is actually expired. I know it is expired because I already ran it before I pulled you, but 99% of the time I'll get a &quot;it can't be expired&quot; or &quot;there is no way it has been expired that long&quot;. If they've already dug out the registration is can literally point to it and end that line of argument.</p>
<p>Another good thing about asking for documents is that it is great for getting people who are drunk/high. Most can get their IDs just fine, but I've yet to see a drunk get their registration right on the first try. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US if you don't have your drivers license on you, a police officer can indeed just run your name and birthday and find out if your valid. Although you will get a citation for not having it if you and/or the officer are jerks at the encounter. It's just easier if you have it and they can just take it and scan it. Also, I'm not sure if their computers can pull your picture to verify you're not giving them someone else's name and DOB. Many rural areas probably still do radio dispatching. </p>
<p>Also, in the US there's no requirement to carry a passport or national ID card, so a driver's license is a de-facto ID card for drinking, cashing a check, renting a hotel room, whatever (If you don't drive you can get a non-drivers-license state ID card). Generally children don't have a need to carry an ID until they're old enough to drive. </p>
<p>And believe it or not, everyone does not have a smartphone. My mother and sister do not, just &quot;old fashioned&quot; flip phones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I never realised it was law to carry your license &amp; registration in the U.S. Here in the UK if you get pulled over &amp; asked for your licence, if you don't have it you get something like a week to drop by your local station to produce it. Also the records of registered keepers of all vehicles are stored on a database so you don't need to show that at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I was once pulled over by a cop. He told me that he ran my plates, and I was flagged as having an expired registration. When he came up to my car he saw my registration sticker on the windshield, saw that it was current and correct, explained the mix up, and then let me leave.</p>
<p>With that said, I've pulled up my insurance on my phone and cops have taken it. I just have to hope my phone is always charged when I'm pulled over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
