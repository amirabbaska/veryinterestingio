		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The EU is talking about banning neonicotinoids, and everybody is raving about how this is evidence based policy.  I can see there is some evidence that neonicotinoids kill bees, but it's not obviously conclusive (from my very quick scan of the literature).</p>
<p>These kinds of questions have been asked a few years ago, but I believe significant new evidence has come out since, so I think it's worth asking again.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the answers so far.  I just wanted to clarify: I suppose the point in the question is - if they ban neonicotinoids, would that have a significant positive effect on bee populations?  </p>
<p>Of course, many of the answers have addressed that, and answers to the unclarified question are still appreciated.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Neonics&quot; are insecticidal chemicals that will kill pretty much any insect including bees. The problem is with application. No one is spraying bees with insecticide (maybe some peoole are idk) but their use leaves large residual ammounts in the environment which eventually get back to the bees since they tend to get around. Neonics are used to protect crops from crop pests but guess who is pollinating thise same crops? Its the bees. So even without targeting bees with insecticides they still get adequate contact and dosage to have an effect on their health.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neonics are very persistent in the environment.  Some pesticides stick around a long time, some are gone very quickly. That's part of the problem; neonics stick around and become an issue for non-target species. I deal with pesticides daily in my career and these are indeed a problem. I support a ban, because we have many other effective and less harmful products we can use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that &quot;pesticides&quot; includes herbicides, which do not affect bees in the same way as insecticides (like neonicotinoids).  Often times for my job (maintaining vegetation on power line corridors) people use the blanket statement of &quot;pesticides&quot; and believe we're killing everything. Herbicides strictly target plant cells, not animal cells.</p>
<p>As another commenter said, neonicotinoids are generally used to protect crops from pest insects like aphids, which unfortunately has collateral damage on bees and native pollinators.  This is one of the reasons why large scale agricultural operations have to rent hives of European honeybees. They literally have tractor trailers of bee hives delivered to their farm and spread them out over their cropland. And then because bees need a diverse diet of pollen in order to be healthy, they rotate these hives to different types of agricultural fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neonicotinoids are pesticides similar to nicotine, a natural insecticide in tobacco. Like most pesticides, they are categorized based on their application. In this case, they are a general insecticide that will target any insect that comes in contact with it, affecting their nervous system. Bees are natural pollinators so they will become in contact with residual insecticides. The problem with pesticides is that even though they are meant to target specific pests, they can have an unintentional effect on other species such as organochlorines.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neonicotinoid pesticides commonly found in agricultural areas kill bees and hurt their ability to reproduce, two separate large-scale studies confirmed for the first time Thursday.
The two studies — one that examined honeybees in Canada and the other that looked at three bee species in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hungary — were the first large-scale investigations to test the popular agrochemicals influence on bees in real world settings.
The work also turns many preconceived notions about bees and pesticides on their heads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
