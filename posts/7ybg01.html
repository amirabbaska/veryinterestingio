		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egypt is one of the oldest civilizations on the planet and we hear a lot about them and their history prior to European colonial era. We also hear a lot about the Caliphate eras of the middle ages and dark ages which controlled much of North and Central Africa, and of Carthage that was in North Africa during the Roman era. </p>
<p>But you are correct that there is not a lot on Central and Southern Africa. That would be because most of those tribal groups did not have written language so we do not have records of their history outside of oral traditions of the groups, or records of them made by other groups. </p>
<p>Also you talk as though slavery was something unique to Imperial Europe and the Americas. It was not. Slavery has existed as long as civilization has existed and virtually every ethnic group on the planet has owned slaves and been slaves at some point in their history. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prior to the arrival of Europeans in Africa the Caliphates dominated North Africa and sub-sarahan Africa was split into a hundred smaller kingdoms/empires.  There was no large unification, it was just a bunch of kingdoms vying for power against their neighbors but no one really conquering the continent to simplify history</p>
<p>I'm going to put this under &quot;its really messy and confusing&quot; rather than racist.  Its the same reason you don't learn about pre-Roman Gaul, you won't be able to keep track of the 100 different tribes in the area and in the end it didn't shape the world today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have said, but I would like to put in my two cents as I took a history of South Africa class at my University (University of Delaware) under one of the most renowned historians in sub-saharan African history. If you're interested, his name is Wunyabari Maloba. To be honest, if you sent him an email and explained your interest I bet he would be willing to recommend some books/resources for reading. </p>
<p>Mostly because of a lack of written history to answer your question though. When I wrote my two essays for the class, most of the books I read to gather info were written by the first Dutch priests who were part of the colonization effort. Also definitely look up Shaka and the Xhosa as others have said. There is some history of earlier times or concurrent as these priests interacted with the natives in the area. In general though, the story of sub Saharan Africa is super interesting. Their societies were set up in a completely different way from basically anywhere else in the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On a related note, does anyone have some good resources to learn what we do know about sub-Saharan Africa's ancient history?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before what slavery?  Slavery is as old as civilization.</p>
<p>Most cultures focus on history that pertains to their culture. We learn about Greeks and Celts and the Levant because those are the stories that shaped our own stories. The parts of ancient Africa we do focus on (Egypt, Carthage, Ethiopia) touched on our history. </p>
<p>Plus, as you suggested, much of Africa didn’t form large civilizations for very long throughout history, and documentation is scarce. It’s no coincidence we know a lot about Egypt: they built big stone things, and they wrote a lot down. </p>
<p>I didn’t learn much in school about ancient East Asia, the Americas much before colonialism, India, etc. It’s not a racist thing. It’s just not a part of my culture’s history. </p>
<p>I’m sure children in Africa learn considerably more about themselves than we learn about them and vice versa. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
