		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fastest visual perception is about 13 milliseconds. Of course generating a respond based on that will take time but time to a light flash to detection will be about 13ms. It takes about 250ms to respond to a visual cue (light turning on) and click a button in response. You can test your own reaction time here: <a href="https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/" target="_blank">https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/</a></p>
<p>The time from an event and it hitting your retina is insignificant compared to the time it takes to process because it's the distance from you to the object divided by the speed of light which is almost 300 million meters per second. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This principle was introduced to me in my A&amp;P class and the professor used to to say it is impossible to live in the moment. By the time a signal is transmitted by a sensor (retina, proprietor, otolith, etc.), then sent to the brain to be processed and interpreted, that original signal is already in the past. We are always living slightly in the past. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you mean by brain and what you mean by process. There's a part of the midbrain - the superior colliculus - that can receive visual motion information and use your spine to get you out of danger before you're consciously aware of it. So for example, someone throws a ball at your head, you jerk out of the way - and THEN realize what happened. The light information went on two simultaneous paths. One to the superior colliculus on the order of about 13-50ms. The other path goes to the occipital lobe (in the back of the head), then the parietal lobe (middle), then the frontal lobe (front). In the occipital lobe, identification happened but you weren't able yet to decide what to do about it. That process takes about 150ms. In the parietal lobe, the information about the ball was integrated with the information from the rest of the senses (maybe you heard a shout), that process takes about 200ms from the start of the signal, then the signal is sent to your forebrain where you both decide what to do (prefrontal cortex) and do it (motor cortex). That whole process takes about 250ms from the start of the signal. Actually responding can take longer (because you have to move a limb which means overcoming inertia) so reaching up to catch the ball might take 500ms (a half second).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can we talk about what receiving that information and  processing it means?  </p>
<p>Do you know that is you see a nasty threat (mad tiger jumps from around the corner), your body's fight or flight response will be trigger before &quot;you&quot; even realize/coprehwnd what you're seeing.</p>
<p>Neurobiologists and anatomists get in here.</p>
<p>I remember discussing the corpora quadrigemina (? - 4 twin bodies?) in thw midbrain (?) during undergrad neuerobiology.  That structure in puts visual info form the optic nerve and outputs both to higher functions (e.g. cortex) and more base processing (sympatheric nervous system).  That signal travel time and unconscious hormonal response is faster than the time to get to the brain and process.  By the time you percieve the threat you've already initiated a epinephrinw /adrenaline response.</p>
<p>That one always fascinated me </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
