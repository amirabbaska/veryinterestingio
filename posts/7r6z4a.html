		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation, specifically chemical signal molecules called cytokines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785020/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785020/</a></p>
<p>When you get infected with the cold or flu viruses you get replicating virus that likes to infect lots of cells.  As a response, infected cells begin to alert nearby cells by sending out molecular signals called cytokines.  These signals alert neighboring cells to up their defenses and tell the immune system something is going down.  These cytokines include interleukins and TNFa.  Activated immune cells in turn pump out more (and different) cytokines to recruit more immune cells and signal to various parts of the immune system to perform their functions. </p>
<p>Neurons interestingly have receptors for many cytokines, linking the immune system to the nervous system.  This can cause neuronal activation and signal pain.  Additionally, inflammatory cytokines can trigger the production of prostaglandins, which are lipid messenger molecules.  They have known roles in lowering the threshold of neuron activation.  Meaning that elevated prostaglandins can lead to easier triggering of neurons that signal pain.</p>

<p>And as a side note for more localized pain: chest pain can occur due to tissue damage by the virus as well as increased fluid/cells that influx as a result of the mounting immune response.  This swelling causes pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cytokines is correct but what may be a more fitting answer to &quot;why&quot; is that the cytokine induced myalgia (muscle soreness) causes breakdown of skeletal muscle cells which frees up proteins and amino acids to be converted to antibodies etc by the liver. </p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from &quot;Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza.&quot; (a review from The Lancet, Infectious Diseases) which is a very interesting review which covers why we go through all the symptoms during a URTI (upper respiratory tract infection).</p>
<p>&quot;Muscle aches and pains (myalgia) are a common symptom of URTIs, with around 50% of patients with common cold experiencing these symptoms.49 Myalgia isa symptom of the acute phase response to infection and there is evidence that the symptom is caused by the effects of cytokines on skeletal muscle.63 Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated as inducing the breakdown of muscle proteins, and tumour necrosis factor was initially referred to as cachetin because of its role in causing muscle wasting or cachexia.64 The breakdown of muscle protein in response to URTI can be viewed as beneficial because it mobilises proteins and amino acids that can be converted in the liver to opsonins and other components of the immune response.64 Fever associated with URTIs is usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms such as myalgia and there is much evidence that indicates that both these symptoms are caused by the production of prostaglandin E2 in response to circulating cytokines.63The cytokine-induced generation of prostaglandin E2and the breakdown of skeletal muscle in vitro is inhibited by indomethacin,63 and similarly myalgia associated with URTIs is relieved with acetylsalicylicacid.49 Prostaglandin E2 is a mediator of pain by its effects on peripheral pain receptors.65 The cytokine stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production in skeletal muscle, and the effects of prostaglandin E2 on sensory nerves in muscle, may explain the myalgia associated with URTIs.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another possible reason is because when you contract a virus your body's lymph system is activated and lymph nodes swell and can become tender. Lymph nodes are located throughout your body and are located in areas which are the most protected such as the &quot;inside&quot; of your elbow, shoulders and pelvic bones.  I know whenever I get sick the first place I feel it is in my hips due to the activation of the lymph nodes in the area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an amazing question!! I don’t know the whole answer but I do know part of it is from the inflammation that sickness brings on. Sickness or infection drives the immune system to release inflammatory cascades that can increase sensitivity to pain all over the body. Mix this with inflammation of the soft tissue around joints (not the joints themselves) during sickness and you get a pretty crappy feeling- moving a flexible joint that wants to bend within a rigid structure (inflamed soft tissue) that is already increasingly sensitive. Another part is the temperature and fever but I don’t know these mechanics to directly cause joint pain. </p>
<p>This is probably on a small portion of it- excited to see other responses!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
