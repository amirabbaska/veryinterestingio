		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to /u/crnaruka 's answer and putting some numbers on it, if we are talking about the deuterium-tritium cycle which is what we are aiming for with current projects, then the limiting factor would actually be lithium, which is used to breed the tritium. We could supply the worlds current total energy requirements of about 60 KWh/day/person for about 150 - 200 years with known reserves of minable lithium. However, if we include lithium in seawater and figure out a way to extract it, then we are much better off with about 1.5 million years of generation at 60 kWh/d/p.</p>
<p>If we can get the (technically harder) deuterium - deuterium cycle running, then to all intents and purposes it's effectively infinite (something like 10,000 million years at current usage levels and current population)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, no, strictly speaking hydrogen (and especially its heavier isotopes) is not a renewable resource as there's only so much of it here on Earth to go around. But by the same token no resource is truly renewable. For example, we usually treat sunlight as being renewable, but when you think about it, billions from today the sun will also run out of hydrogen and slowly start to flicker away. Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that the sun will be around that it can continue to power the world for thousands and thousands of generations, which is why we usually treat it as unending for all practical purposes. The same is true for hydrogen on Earth: we currently we have 1,386,000,000km^(3) of water to draw hydrogen from! Even if in this water you only have one deuterium atom per 6000 atoms of hydrogen, that still comes out to millions and million killiograms of this energy packed fuel. Let's put it this way, if we get fusion to work and continue to use energy at current rates, before we needed to worry about running out of hydrogen we would have rather more pressing concerns (such as the end of the sun). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to all the other answers, you should also take into account that you probably (disclaimer: not a plasma physicist) need superconducting magnets in order to keep the plasma in place. These magnets are cooled with liquid helium beyond the critical temperature for superconduction. Regularly, there are worldwide shortages of the helium supply which could be problematic for the continuous operation of fusion reactors. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you all also don't consider, assuming you use all the Hydrogen (and/or deuterium/ Lithium) in some large number of fusion reactors, is the total energy output.  If you use it up too quickly (as has been postulated in some science fiction novels as I recall), you're going to get heat buildup.  Right now with all our energy usage the incident energy from the sun is many many orders of magnitude larger.  However, assuming you had this unlimited source of energy, and that everyone's resultant energy consumption went up exponentially as a result, consider that you're going to start getting heat pollution, as the earth isn't going to be able to dissipate more energy without heating up.</p>
<p>No, I have no hard numbers. Imma go skiing while I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eventually. How long depends where you get it from- and what type of reaction you're using.</p>
<p>In the long run, hydrogen is just as renewable as any other known 'renewable' energy source, which is to say, none of them will <em>really</em> last forever. The Sun fuses hydrogen to power itself, so although we say that solar power (and indirect forms such as wind and hydroelectric) is 'renewable', the fact is that someday (estimated to be in about five billion years' time) the Sun's core will no longer have enough hydrogen to keep running. Every other known physical process that creates useful energy is also ultimately limited in one way or another, so 'renewable' is just a matter of perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
