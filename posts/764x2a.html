		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main chemical reaction is the polymerization of smaller tannin units into chains and sheets.</p>
<p>The smaller tannin subunits taste bitter and are astringent.
Astringency refers to the mouth-drying sensation resulting from the tannins binding to proteins in the saliva.</p>
<p>As a result, the larger tannin polymers have fewer functional groups, and the wine is less bitter and smoother.</p>
<p>There are other reactions that can occur, including the hydrolysis of aroma molecules that are bound to sugar molecules, &quot;freeing up&quot; more complex aromas as well. This can occur in some whites. The tannin chemistry is more important in reds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out that everyone here is wrong :P Except &quot;JustAGuyFromGermany&quot;. </p>
<p>Read this paper: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/3/1050.full" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/105/3/1050.full</a> </p>
<p>In this experiment they scanned people's brains while they drank wine. They focused on the part of the brain associated with pleasure. </p>
<p>They found that if they gave the test subjects 5 dollar wine but said it costs 45 dollars, then the part associated with pleasure had much more activity than when they said the 5 dollar wine cost 5 dollars. So in fact, we enjoy wine (and thus probably other stuff) more if ONLY the price is higher. Regardless of whether or not the actual product is better and SHOULD be perceived as more enjoyable. When they took more expensive wine and did the same and compared the results, the difference was negligible between the more expensive wine and the cheap wine. </p>
<p>This make sense however in evolution. Because lets say you spend three days hunting and get a single deer from your work. Or lets define &quot;work&quot; as &quot;expenditure of calories&quot;, also known as &quot;cost&quot;. You then resulted with several hundred pounds of &quot;normal meat&quot; and just tiny amounts of meat like heart and tenderloin. So a pound of tenderlon costs a lot more than the other meat. Thus when you give the tenderloin to a female, it makes sense for her to perceive it as better than normal meat, because if you can dish up more costly presents than the other guy you are the better bet for feeding children. And so you also developed in the same way, because then its an additional sign of commitment from you, when you are willing to give up the best food for her sake (in modern times that's the flowers and diamonds because you are willing to give up money for something she knows perfectly well you think is the same as burning your money). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recommend caution on topics like these. While there are plenty of interesting chemical reactions going on in wine, very little can be said as to whether they actually make wine &quot;better&quot;. Remember all the studies that show that even wine experts cannot distinguish cheap and expensive wines under controlled conditions (in particular: when they are blinded). Granted, strictly speaking, this only shows that quality does not correlate well to price, but taken in a broader context of human psychology it also indicates that much of what makes wines &quot;special&quot;/&quot;high quality&quot;/... happens more in the mind of the drinker than in the wine itself.</p>
<p>I don't deny there is plenty of quite interesting chemistry going on, but it is debatable whether it is actually the chemistry that makes a wine significantly &quot;better&quot; (as opposed to psychological and social factors which might have the much greater impact on the perceived quality of the drink).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After the bottle is opened, evaporation of some of the volatiles has the biggest effect on taste. It used to be thought that letting wine &quot;breath&quot; meant mostly oxidation of some of the components. But <a href="http://www.winespectator.com/drvinny/show/id/43353" target="_blank">recent research</a> shows it is more the evaporation of some volatiles that has the biggest effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wine is made up of hundreds of compounds, and with aeration, usually the volatile undesirable compounds will evaporate faster than the desirable, aromatic and flavorful ones.</p>
