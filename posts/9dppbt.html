		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add what others are saying, if you drink something, it can often go straight through the stomach, and alcohol and caffeine are both absorbed faster in the intestines, and with greater efficiency. That's part of why drinking on an empty stomach will get you drunk faster, or coffee with no food will hit you quicker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s more that everything gets thrown together into a big pot in whatever order you eat it, but once it’s in there it dissolves fairly simultaneously.</p>
<p>You might get a small change if you take it simultaneously with a big meal or other drinks, because that dilutes it down and means it takes longer for everything to be digested, but your stomach is definitely not some sort of conveyor belt that digests things one at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things digest together. It's more of a matter of drinking coffee with a meal, or drinking separately, that influences how fast caffeine goes into your system.</p>
<p>It's also why you are advised to take some medications together or right before/after meal, so that the pill is dissolved in a more controlled rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. </p>
<p>Caffeine as a liquid will be absorbed as soon as it gets to the intestines. </p>
<p>But the order that you eat does affect some absorption. It depends on the frequency. If you eat everything at once, it all ends up in the stomach, and it becomes mixed together as its digested.</p>
<p>If you don't, and take some time between what you eat, it will digest in that order.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is how your poop looks. Eat something red like red beets and then dont eat anything for an hour. Then eat some carbs and drink clam chowder, and your poop will be white.</p>
<p>Then you'll poop out red poop and then white poop. So the order does matter.</p>
<p>But for things that are liquid, the order doesn't really matter because the absorption rates are different for things like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
