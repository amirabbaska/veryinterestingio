<p>I'm not sure what you mean when you describe ego death though. From the personal experience of a friend of mine who is totally not me, it isn't that your ego dies when you trip, and you are a different person afterwards, it is that there can be a sense of &quot;ego death&quot; during the trip, but you go back to being yourself as you come down (of course the experience can change you as well, but I wouldn't necessarily call that ego death, non-psychedelic experiences can also change you, and we don't say that is caused by ego death).</p>
<p>What is this ego death like? Well, I am sure experiences vary widely, but here is the experience of that friend who is totally not me: I'd describe the experience as less ego death, than ego expansion. Imagine you are sitting in a room with some people, and others are coming and going through the door. Now the feeling starts to build in you that everything going on around you is just part of yourself, part of your mind, part of your existence. Whenever someone enters the door it isn't just something you notice, but something you feel, as though their entering the door only happened because of your awareness of it. At the same time, you are aware that this is weird, like you have two tracks of thought going on: one experiencing a feeling of oneness with the world around you, and one that is observing the other (in other words, you aren't delusional, part of your mind realizes these &quot;mental sensations&quot; aren't an accurate depiction of reality). I'm not sure I can explain it any better than that.</p>
<p>I have often wondered if this sort of experience is caused by a disruption in what Metzinger calls the &quot;Ego Tunnel&quot; illusion our brain generates. Everything we experience of the world around us is actually a reconstruction created in the brain based on sensory input, in which our self-model is placed. So perhaps this sense of ego death or ego expansion is caused by this process being disrupted in such a way as to make us vaguely aware of it. In this sense the experience is true. The &quot;ego tunnel&quot; of the mind is part of yourself. Seeing someone walk into a room is all in your head, it is just that what is going on in your head is based on something really happening in the external world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difficulty here is the ineffable nature of the psychedelic experience. As a simplified analogy, imagine going to the doctor and having a pain in a part of your body that you can't name. You have to resort to demonstration and pointing to get the doctor to understand. The psychedelic experience is sort of like that in parts, you feel and experience things that you don't have a word for, and the only way to point it out to someone is for them to also experience it. Ego death is the pinnacle of this scenario, where all that was explainable and definable as 'you', is no more.</p>
<p>I've never had ego death, but even in my limited LSD experience I know i've felt things that I couldn't explain here in words. I think that's going to make your ELI5 difficult, or impossible, to answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ego death to me happened during a dmt experience. I was faced with all of my fears, my demons, every uncertainty in my life was fluttering around me as I fly through this space. It was so high energy and terrifying.  I finally relaxed after my friend said everything is alright. I saw everything leave my body like a paisley patterned rain drop from each pore on my body. After that,  I was comfortable. Things changed,  I'm no longer uncomfortable with people touching me,  as well as thinking deeply,  I'm just okay with just about everything. Everything changed after that moment of acceptance and I'm very thankful for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like being so amazed by something that all your thoughts and attention are focused on that. You feel nothing else, there is nothing else and that something is everything.</p>
<p>It's like a dream where you aren't yourself, but rather some omnipresent being. Like being a dummy pronoun. In the sentence &quot;It is dark outside&quot; what does the &quot;it&quot; refer to?</p>
<p>It's like tuning a radio to listen to all stations at the same time and instead of sounding like chaos, it is soothing. Then when you're &quot;coming back down&quot; it's like you're focusing back to the radio station that is our existence.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I think it happens is because the experience from the drug is so strange that everything else seems normal. All your preconceptions and all the things you think you know are being challenged, so you feel as though everything is possible and everything is acceptable. Everything is ok and everything is real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently some people are not aware of ego death. We aren't talking about the consciousness expanding effects that can make the ego seem trivial in the grand scheme of the universe but rather an experience closer to amnesia.</p>
<p>I had an experience on mushrooms where a friend was having a bad trip that began to affect mine. He started to panic about something, I became overstimulated, and the end result was that I put my toes over the edge of ego death and looked down, so to speak. </p>
<p>My experience was that the overwhelming amount of stimulus started pushing aspects of my emotions, memory, or consciousness out. First I forgot stuff like who I was with or where we were. Next I forgot stuff like what I had done to feel so strangely. Then I forgot my name and who I was. I don't think I went fully into ego death because I did remember &quot;I&quot;, just had no idea what &quot;I&quot; was. </p>
<p>The only thing left from who I was before was duty. I couldn't forget that I had responsibilities. I didn't know what those responsibilities were, but I knew that they were important and that they depended on me. This is one of the more frightening things that I've experienced, because I knew that I was in no condition to fulfill any responsibilities to anyone. I was just left with the overwhelming sense that I had a duty and that I had abandoned my post in some way. Imagine going on a three week vacation in Thailand only to lose your passport and money, then you realize that you left your baby in the car at the airport two weeks ago. That kind of feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
