<p>We want meaning in our lives. Life is a balance between order and chaos and we don't take too well to chaos but it can be overcome and made into order, making us feel accomplished and life meaningful. Music mimics this process. It's highly ordered and miraculous. He claims even the most nihilistic of us like music because of this reason. It generates meaning. People on psychedelics often say they really understand and can see the structure of music way differently than the normal waking state. Haven't done them though so can't comment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the short neurobiological answer. Music is processed by the auditory system in the brain, just like verbal information (speaking). The auditory system is connected to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotion processing. Music can, just like verbal information, activate the entire limbic system and thus stimulate an emotional response if it's suitable for the situation (context processing is also important in stimulating an emotional response). </p>
<p>The same goes to other sensory perceptions - vision can also stimulate an emotional response, for example art paintings. Smell is unique in the sense (pun unintended) that smell information travels directly to its cortex in the brain, unlike the other sensory information that first passes through a relay station (the thalamus), and is tightly connected to the hippocampus (responsible for memory formation, context and emotion processing). Smell can thus trigger very profound memory recall to specific situations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I haven't finished the book yet, but he does touch on some of the research in this area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
