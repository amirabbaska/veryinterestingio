<p>The UK had an independent Press Complaints Commission which does try to keep the news sane, even if that means censuring the government. If you wanted to try that in the USA, it would probably require an Act of Congress, and it wouldn't get past your current highly-partisan Congress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't. Publications that lie or spread information are generally sued for defamation, slander or libel. It happens all the time. </p>
<p>As far as professional associations go, There is the society of professional journalists, which most reputable journalists belong to. However, it would arguably be unconstitutional to require licensing to report news, at least in the US (freedom of speech and all). </p>
<p>Anyone can write an article, blog, or tweet these days. It's ultimately your responsibility as the consumer to evaluate the sources from which you gather your news. Research publications before giving them your trust. Do your homework. Don't believe everything you read. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see you talk about engineers in ontario and so I am going to go ahead and assume you are an engineer.  This means certain things that we should understand.  First it means that in a professional capacity you are not a gambler.  You want things to tick along with mechanical precision, regularity and reliability.</p>
<p>You need to appreciate however that this is a bias on your part and is just one option among many.  You like things to be orderly, but they don't necessarily have to be.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to freedom of expression.  There is not some kind of formulaic rule that says &quot;Free Expression + regulation that is equal to or less than X = Good social outcome&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead freedom of expression is a gamble.  At the time of its founding america was called &quot;the grand experiment&quot;.  This was specifically because of things like free expression being a wager.</p>
<p>So, what's the bet?  The bet is that if we get a large group of people together, let them say whatever the hell they want to (including lie and deliberately try to trick each other), that good information will tend to rise above the lies and society will tend to operate more efficiently than if expression is restricted.</p>
<p>And it turns out we won that bet big time.  It turns out (luckily) that generally speaking people prefer the truth and smart people make better arguments when supported by the truth than they make when trying to lie to the degree that it is in fact very difficult to get away with a lie in an open debate (you ever see people being called out brutally on reddit for lying?).</p>
<p>Now, like anything else we did discover that there were some... exceptions... that needed to be made.  It turns out letting people threaten to murder other people isn't good.  it turns out letting people incite violence isn't good.  It turns out allowing people to commit fraud isn't good.  But just because there are some exceptions doesn't mean we can get away from the fundamental wager and try to simply prohibit &quot;bad&quot; expression.</p>
<p>It isn't neat.  It isn't formulaic.  It isn't guaranteed and reliable.  But not only does it tend to work out, we see again and again that the alternative universally results in societies jumping off a cliff straight to hell (look at Russia).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reputation of the publication is all that's really needed. Think about the publication you trust; how did they get that way? They print factual, well reported, unbiased (as possible) news, and have done so for decades if not more than a century. </p>
<p>Honestly, if you're getting your news from Facebook and disreputable places, that's your own fault. As a citizen it's your responsibility to get accurate news. And most newspapers have STRICT, STRICT guidelines on what can be published. If you can't get corroboration on a piece of information, generally it won't be used. Even confidential sources need corroboration. </p>
<p>Journalism is an occupation of idealists. You don't become a reporter for the money. There isn't much in it. It's very good at self regulating if it's an actual newspaper and not a mouth piece for political or religious organizations. </p>
<p>Reliable news requires a little work on your part. Do your research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
