		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stability of an atom is determined not just by the atom in question, but the atoms that it could decay into as well. If an atom is heavier than another one plus the mass of any emitted radiation needed to get there, then it will be radioactive. This is because mass is energy (E=mc2) so extra mass means energy available to emit.</p>
<p>So the basic answer is &quot;because every Tc atom is heavier than a Mo or Ru atom of the same mass number plus the radiation emitted to turn into it&quot;.</p>
<p>Why that the case? A major part of it is that nuclei are lighter and therefore more stable when they have (separately) even numbers of protons and neutrons, because they like to pair up. Tc has 43 protons, so it's partially screwed on that count. Furthermore, Tc-98 is smack on the line of stability, but has 55 neutrons and is screwed on both counts (and Ru-98 is even-even of course, so that exacerbates the difference in mass). Its neighbors Tc-97 and -99 would have a good shot at being stable having even numbers of neutrons, but nuclear physics just happens to work out to make them barely able to decay to Mo-97 and Ru-99 (both are over the threshold by only about 300 keV, which is around 60% the mass of an electron).  The same concept goes for prometheum.</p>
<p>Why did the masses happen to work out this way for Tc when it doesn't for most other odd-proton elements? I'm a nuclear physicist that used to specialize in measuring nuclear masses, and I have long ago given up trying to understand how nuclear masses work. Nuclear theory is so complicated that it is basically unsolvable, so I can't point to any one effect that caused this. For now we just go out and measure the masses.</p>
<p>I know that's unsatisfying, but so is nuclear physics in the end.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of &quot;light&quot; nuclei that are radioactive (such as Carbon 14, and Hydrogen-3/Tritium). In fact most nuclei are radioactive, as can be seen from the <a href="http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/33_segre/segre1.png" target="_blank">Segre chart</a></p>
<p>Roughly speaking, heavier elements can decay by alpha emission, while lighter nuclei can't. This is why past a certain point all nuclei are radioactive. However most nuclei (even light ones) are radioactive. </p>
<p>edit: Technetium is special as it is the lightest element with no stable isotopes. But in general any element will have an unstable isotope. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are radioactive 'elements' all the way down the periodic table, to Hydrogen. Some basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>An atom's nucleus has a collection of protons and neutrons. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, and almost identical chemistry. </li>
<li>whether a nucleus is radioactive or stable depends on the number of protons AND neutrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Hydrogen: Usually, a Hydrogen atom has a single proton in its nucleus. A small fraction of the Hydrogen on earth - in water, in our bodies, everywhere - has a proton AND a neutron. It's still stable. </p>
<p>An even tinier fraction, a tiny trace amount, has a proton and TWO neutrons. These &quot;Hydrogen-3&quot; nuclei are unstable - If you had a bottle of it and left it on a shelf, 12 years later you'd have a bottle half-filled with Hydrogen-3, the other half would have turned one of their neutrons onto a proton, becoming Helium-3. </p>
<p>You used to be able to buy little perspex necklace or keyring charms filled with Hydrogen-3 on the internet. The radioactive decay would make the gas glow in the dark.</p>
<p>After hundreds or thousands of years, you'd have no Hydrogen left in the bottle. </p>
<p>If you change the number of neutrons in a nucleus, you get different &quot;isotopes&quot; of the element. Some isotopes are stable, some decay very slowly, some decay very quickly. Some elements have no stable isotopes, such as Technetium, Promethium, but many others also - Uranium, Radium, Californium, for example ... anything beyond Lead on the periodic table.</p>
<p>Technetium and Promethium are special though.</p>
<p>Uranium is radioactive - eventually, a sample of Uranium would completely decay, leaving not a single atom left. However, the most stable isotope of Uranium takes 4.5 billion for just half to decay. That's right, 50% of the U-238 originally on earth is still around. </p>
<p>Hydrogen-3 is found on earth, even though it decays so quickly, because it's continually formed as the atmosphere gets bombarded by cosmic rays. </p>
<p>Other fast-decaying isotopes are found on earth because they are formed as a slow-decaying element decays. Thorium-234 decays in  matter of weeks, but an atom of Th-234 is produced every time a U-238 atom decays. There will always be Th-234 until the U-238 all runs out, billions of years after the sun fades into an inert ball of dark gas. </p>
<p>But Technetium is special. It has no stable isotopes. The only isotope that is produced at all naturally is Tc-99, which is a rare result of fission of U-235. U-235 which is already rare, usually just decays to Thorium-235, and even when it undergoes fission, usually doesn't produce Technetium. For all intents and purposes, Technetium doesn't occur naturally at all, and must be synthesized.</p>
<p>Promethium is similar. </p>
<p>These are not the only synthetic elements, but they are the two lightest, and so are quite special. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elements with odd proton numbers have far fewer stable isotopes than even elements, for reasons of the stability of pairing. Several dozen odd-atomic number elements lighter than lead have only ONE stable isotope (fluorine, sodium, aluminum, phosphorus, etc). Both Pm and Tc are odd elements (43 and 61).</p>
<p>The other instability comes with not having completed or near-completed nucleon quantum energy number &quot;shells&quot; for both neutrons and protons. The &quot;magic numbers&quot; that apply here are at 28, 50, and 82, and are most stable (lowest energy) when filled, or nearly filled. For example, tin, the element with 50 protons, has 10 stable isotopes, the most stable isotopes of any element (the next nearest is xenon with eight).</p>
<p>You can see that both Tc and Pm are in the middle of a magic number gap on proton count, and so is the number of neutrons needed to stabilize their various isotopes, even going up or down a few for different isotopes. </p>
<p>The upshot is that they just barely can't exist on a timescale compatible with being around for 4.6 billion years, and thus making it to the status of primordial elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
