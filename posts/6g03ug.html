		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CONTEXT:
During a recent brief discussion with my doctor I asked whether there was a benefit for people who used Ritalin, but aren't diagnosed with ADHD. She responded by saying that there isn't one and that, that's one way specialists are able to tell, besides tests and what not. This comment left me somewhat confused as I'm aware that there is quite a large market around selling Ritalin/Adderall illegally, hence the heavy regulations on prescriptions. On one hand I know it's popular with university students to assist with studying, however, on the other hand I've heard that people abuse it to gain a high. </p>
<p>QUESTION:
Are the people who obtain and use it illegally for the assistance they gain with studying/working, people who have ADHD but haven't sought out a specialist to get a diagnosis. While the people who use it for the purpose of getting high do not have ADHD?</p>
<p>If so, what difference in an individual's brain chemistry causes this drug to react to react differently for people who have it versus the people who don't. </p>
<p>Tl;dr</p>
<p>If someone gains the intended effects of Ritalin/Adderall does this confirm they have ADHD? And that getting a high from taking it, is indicative of not having it? If yes, chemically speaking, why?</p></div></div>

<p><strong>AND NOTHING I'M SAYING BELOW SHOULD BE CONSTRUED TO BE MEDICAL ADVICE. TALK TO YOUR PHYSICIAN IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research says that amphetamine/methylphenidate  stimulants can improve attention/processing speed for everyone. EDIT: THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ABUSING STIMULANT DRUGS IS OKAY OR EVEN BENEFICIAL. ONLY TAKE ADHD MEDICATION YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES YOU. PERIOD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved cognition with stimulants does not therefore equal a diagnosis of ADHD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A poor response to stimulants also does not equal the absence of ADHD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The downregulation of dopamine receptors with long term use contributes to both dependency and withdrawal effects upon discontinuation. The research is unclear if this (at least to some degree) is permanent or not. </p>
</li>
<li>There's a big difference between a developing brain and an adult brain with respect to the benefits of stimulant therapy on frontal lobe development. That is, kids with ADHD on stimulants may develop more &quot;normal&quot; brains as they mature and adults with ADHD are likely stuck with lifelong frontal lobe dysfunction. </li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT (and my only edit): Please note that I cannot and will not give any medical advice. For my point #5: ADHD is predominately a frontal lobe disorder (more specifically, a dopaminergic/noradrenergic disorder - and possibly one could add GABA &amp; glutamate to that list as well). As such, if you &quot;have&quot; ADHD as an adult (as defined by your frontal lobe maturation ending), it is a lifelong disorder; however, you can learn how to compensate so well that you no longer experience daily functional problems. </p>
<p>This is why learning to cope/compensate for ADHD is as equally important as pharmacological therapies since the latter may be contraindicated in some folks depending on their health status/comorbid conditions. Finally, just because a kid has ADHD does not mean that stimulant medication is ALWAYS beneficial for frontal lobe development or daily functioning - there are so many factors related to long-term development and daily functioning that any one factor (such as ADHD meds) cannot explain ALL of the developmental trajectory of the frontal lobe. </p>
<p>There are also many many many contraindications to stimulant use and not all ADHD needs to be treated via stimulant medication. IMO, way too many people/kids with ADHD are treated via stimulants instead of first trying behavioral/environmental modification and therapies first. I'll say it again: abusing stimulant compounds is not okay and may be harmful for your health/brain. Lastly, some kids with ADHD (non-medicated) grow out of it (up to 30% in some studies I believe). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People diagnosed with ADHD struggle focusing on singular tasks. Consider a &quot;normal person's&quot; ability to focus as baseline. People with ADHD have a weaker ability to focus so their normal state is below baseline. Stimulants allow them to attain baseline and focus like non-ADHD people can. Non-ADHD people who take the stimulants can become hyper focused. Since we're all already at baseline the drugs increase our focusing ability well beyond it to levels not usually naturally attainable.</p>
<p>As far as the high goes most stimulant prescriptions are tweaks or variations of amphetamine which releases dopamine so of course high doses will cause a high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spent the last 3 years studying stimulant abuse for my doctorate degree! Finally, my time to shine! Most people in this thread have reasonable answers, but they don't have a complete picture. So let me try to answer your question.</p>
<p>ADHD is caused because the part of your brain that needs to be firing to prevent you from getting distracted is not firing anymore. This is usually caused by a lack of dopamine (among another neurotransmitters). Stimulant medication can increase your dopamine in that part of your brain, thereby helping it control the other parts that keep finding new ways to distract you, thereby helping you focus.</p>
<p>What stimulants do in people without ADHD is a question nobody knows the correct answer to. When the FDA approves a stimulant medication, they base it on evidence collected during a clinical trial on people who have ADHD. There have been no trials conducted on people without ADHD to test efficacy of stimulants. But based on our knowledge of physiology, and pharmacology, we can make some decent guesses as to what will happen.  People who don't have ADHD but take stimulants anyway will experience an effect similar to that of crystal meth, but on a much smaller scale. It will provide temporary improvement in focus, short term memory, and attention. Whether this improvement is as high as among those who have ADHD is a question we don't know the answer to, but we expect that it will be lower. We also expect that there will no long term benefits to stimulant use with regard to memory, and focus. </p>
<p>What we do know is that the illegal market for stimulants make people without ADHD think they have it (because they see benefits from stimulant use) leading to an increase in overdiagnosis of ADHD. ADHD is also very difficult to diagnose and very easy to fake, especially for family or general practitioners. We also know the side effects stimulants cause, which most certainly hold true even among those without ADHD. These include heart palpitations, metabolic effects including loss of hunger, mental illnesses like anxiety or depression, and even addiction.. people who do not have ADHD but are addicted to stimulants will reach a point where there brain will decrease producing dopamine in order to account for all the extra dopamine coming from the drug. That's the brain's way of trying to go back to normal. After a few years of use, your brain will now chronically under-produce dopamine leading to the same symptoms as someone with ADHD. So you could essentially give yourself a version of ADHD by overusing stimulants. </p>
<p>My research, in case anyone's interested, is in trying to identify people who are lying about ADHD symptoms or are trying to doctor shop prescriptions for abuse or resale. If you have any questions, ask away! </p>
<p>EDIT1: Added a few more lines based on the topics discussed elsewhere in this thread. Some very dangerous info is out there in some comments. Please be careful.</p>
<p>EDIT2: TL;DR: There are no published clinical trials looking into stimulant use in people without ADHD. But we expect that there will be some short term attention improvement, with no long term benefits. But long term use of stimulants can cause mental illnesses, metabolic issues, cardiac problems, and addiction. Addiction to stimulants will impair your brain performance, essentially giving you a kind of ADHD itself! Be careful, and stay away from stimulants if you don't have ADHD. If you aren't sure if you have ADHD, go see a psychologist!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your doctor is incorrect, but incorrect in a way that is pretty common.  If you give everyone in a class stimulants, almost everyone will have improved focus and a better ability to attend to and complete tasks.  Basically everyone does better on a little bit of stimulant.  That response doesn't confirm anything about what else might be going on in the person's executive functioning or impulse control.  It most certainly isn't a confirmation of a diagnosis of any behavioral disorder, and, just as importantly, it doesn't have anything at all to do with the mechanism of action of a behavioral disorder.  </p>
<p>It's such a weird logical fallacy that people have bought into regarding the relationship between the actions of a medication and the cause(s) of behavioral disorders.  It's made even stranger because it's predicated on a desire to find biological causes for mental disorders, but the same reasoning would be almost always roundly dismissed in physical medicine.  For instance, my father for months has had substantial pain and swelling in his jaw.  As they have sought to ameliorate that, the doctors have treated those symptoms without ever suggesting that the treatment defined the problem.  They gave him Oxycodone for the pain, but never suggested that his &quot;problem&quot; was a lack of opiates in his body or a lack of dopamine in his brain.  They gave him steroids for the swelling, but never once tried to argue that because the pain was alleviated when the swelling was reduced that must mean that the swelling was the cause of the problem.  Yes, the swelling caused the pain, but it turns out that a bone infection caused the swelling.  The action of the steroids was entirely focused on and defining of the symptoms, and not the cause.</p>
<p>TL; DR:  Everyone does better on low dose stimulants, and doing better based on the understood mechanisms of that class of drugs tells us almost nothing about what is going on with the person in any other way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and have been on Adderall for a year and a half now. Disclaimer: I don't have a degree in this, I've just been to a lot of doctors and researched a lot on my own.</p>
<p>Background on ADHD: people who have ADHD suffer from what is basically a malfunctioning reward system. Our brains may not reward us with good feelings when we successfully complete a task, or give us an energy boost to finish when the end of a task is in sight. This failure manifests in the person as lack of motivation, inability to pay attention, and inability to finish tasks. While there are of course other facets to ADHD, these are the parts stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin treat.</p>
<p>Background on Adderall: also called amphetamine, or amphetamine salts, Adderall is a stimulant in the same category as (arguably very similar to) methamphetamine. It functions as a dopamine and norepinephrine agonizer; it stimulates your brain to produce more dopamine (used to reward yourself​, think of that satisfied when you have done something well) and norepinephrine (gives you more energy, promotes &quot;vigilance&quot; and focus, aids you in memory formation).</p>
<p>Now, for your questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone gains the intended effects of Ritalin/Adderall does this confirm they have ADHD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly, but it's definitely useful to know. ADHD is a spectrum; many people who do not feel that it affects their lives enough for medication would still feel some focusing effect. Also, even if you do not have ADHD it will still act as a stimulant and theoretically enhance memory formation, so many people will use it to study for tests. I don't recommend this at all, but it could keep you alert long enough to study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that getting a high from taking it, is indicative of not having it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone still gets some sort of high the first time they take it. At medicinal doses it's very mild. Part of the difference is that recreational doses can often be very high. However, you're not wrong in thinking something about the brain chemistry of a person with ADHD causes you to feel less of a high: Adderall often helps us to produce dopamine at the correct time, but if you already do that it may cause your brain to produce it <em>more</em> than necessary and get you high.</p>
<p>I would be happy to answer questions, but my Adderall is kicking in and it's time for me to go to work so I'll have to stop this explanation here. Feel free to comment or message me. I'd be happy to dig up some articles about the various things I've talked about if anyone wants to read further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
