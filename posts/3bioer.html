		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know if there's a maximum temperature.</p>
<p>In certain models -- string theory is one of them -- there is a maximum temperature called the <em>Hagedorn temperature</em>.  This arises because the number of possible high energy states increases sufficiently fast that as you put more energy into the system, it gets spread out over more and more states in such a way that the temperature decreases less and less for a given amount of heat put in.  Net result is that there's a temperature that is the upper limit of the temperatures that can be reached.</p>
<p>I'll add that even in string theory, some people think the Hagedorn temperature might not be an actual limit, but more an indication that there is a phase transition (like when a liquid turns to gas), but that's even more speculative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in &quot;what is the hottest temperature achievable&quot; that may be an unanswerable question (or at least one I cannot answer), but if you want to know the defined lowest temperature, it is -0K. </p>
<p>It turns out any negative temperature (in K, not C or F) is actually hotter than any positive temp. The temperature scale goes something like this:</p>
<p>0K,... inf K, -inf K, ... -0K</p>
<p>This may seem odd, to answer why this is the case, you must understand a fundamental property of temperature. While temperature is defined as <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Temperature.html" target="_blank">T = dE/dS</a>, aka- Temperature is defined as the derivative of energy with respect to entropy. See, normally as entropy increases, energy increases, but you can arrange systems where the opposite happens, as entropy increases energy actually goes down. That means that temperature will be negative. </p>
<p>Since we know from the Second Law of Thermodynamics that in a closed system, entropy will increase, that means that energy will flow from a negative temperature system to a positive temperature system, because when a system has a negative temperature, by decreasing the energy in the system (heat), the entropy will actually go up (and in a positive system, increasing energy will lead to increased entropy, so entropy goes up there too). </p>
<p>And that's why negative temperature is hotter than positive- heat will flow from the negative temperature to the positive one, and a higher temperature item will have heat flow from it to a lower temperature one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He basically came up with 10^28 - 10^29 K as the maximum temperature because at this point you would be re-initiating the exponential expansion of the Universe (cosmic inflation).</p>
