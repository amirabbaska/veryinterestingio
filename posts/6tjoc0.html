We'll take a nap then 15-30 min later when we wake up we feel more tired and kinda gross. Sometimes I even feel that my senses are heightened or some rush is going through my body. I've read that taking a nap later in the day is not good because it'll keep you up later in the night as you try to sleep. But never really read anything about the feelings I get after taking these dreadful naps. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I totally understand what you're talking about, and I don't take naps because of it. It's kind of random when it happens, no rhyme or reason, which is annoying. But I notice sometimes when I'm <em>really</em> tired, I'll have kind of a 30-60 minute fall asleep (not really intended) nap, and wake up <em>super</em> hot, head rushing, heart pounding, and just general confusion and &quot;what the fuck&quot;-ness, and have to kinda come back to reality.</p>
<p>It's like super not-fun, and it honestly ruins my evening for the next couple hours. I just feel &quot;off&quot; for the rest of the evening, depersonalized, zoned out, weird, and basically have to say &quot;oh well, this day is shot, I'll have to try again tomorrow&quot; and try to go to bed early, and wake up feeling fine.</p>
<p>But at the same times, my shorter naps where it's a really gradual falling-asleep and maybe only spend a few minutes &quot;under&quot;, I usually wake feeling very well-rested and comfortable. I think you're right with trying 15-minutes or less. Basically, just here to say that yeah, that shit sucks, haha. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep inertia. If you are going to nap less than 90 minutes (a full REM cycle), <em>only</em> do it for 15 or less. You will start entering deeper sleep and be groggy afterward otherwise. Bonus for a caffeinated power nap!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not true for everyone. I take naps pretty much every day after work (at around 5:30) and I wake up feeling great, and can go to sleep at a reasonable time with no problem. Even on days off I'll take a nap in the afternoon, and I feel fatigued on days I can't/don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possibly because you didn't complete a full REM cycle (which takes around an hour or so) which is when you fully enter a dream state and happens several times in a full nights sleep.  </p>
<p>So you have: Stage 1 – Sleepiness  </p>
<p>Stage 2 – Light Sleep</p>
<p>Stage 3 &amp; 4 – Deep sleep</p>
<p>REM – Rapid Eye Movement (having a dream) </p>
<p>You likely woke up at Stage 2-ish and your brain was basically going &quot;what the hell? I wanted to sleep!&quot;  It's also why (at least for me) I tend to feel tired when an alarm wakes me up despite getting plenty of sleep as opposed to just waking up naturally.  </p>
<p>So an ideal time for a nap is 60-70 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
