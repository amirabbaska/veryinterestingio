		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take an organic chemistry class and you'll likely find out in lab!</p>
<p>Basically, something's flavors and scents tend to come from only a handful of certain chemicals. If we're talking about food, these compounds are probably aromatic compounds, which means they have a benzene ring somewhere in there. Anyway, make these compounds and you've basically created the flavor and scent you're after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/foodinc/excerpt-fast-food-nation/3/" target="_blank">Here is an interesting article about the &quot;flavor industry&quot;.</a></p>
<p>The whole thing is worth reading, but here's a good quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The small and elite group of scientists who create most of the flavor in most of the food now consumed in the United States are called “flavorists.” They draw upon a number of disciplines in their work: biology, psychology, physiology, and organic chemistry. A flavorist is a chemist with a trained nose and a poetic sensibility. Flavors are created by blending scores of different chemicals in tiny amounts, a process governed by scientific principles but demanding a fair amount of art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That-With-No-Name has it basically right for ELI5 version.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flavors are just a chemicals. And most flavor comes from smell. And there is away to analyze the chemicals that make up a smell (or any gaseous product) called gas chromatography. Once you know the chemical making the smell or taste it can be synthesized. Of course every smell and taste known has already had this done and you can buy banana flavor for your anal lube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
