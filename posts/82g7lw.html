		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scar tissue development. &quot;Inny&quot; and &quot;Outie&quot; belly buttons aren't caused by where the umbilical cord is cut (contrary to a popular misconception). It's dependent on how scar tissue develops as the remaining tissue dries and falls off. This process is random, though &quot;inny&quot; tends to be a more common result. As an aside, the resulting belly button can be influenced by umbilical hernias (when a baby's abdominal muscles haven't fully developed/fused). This can cause the belly button to push outward when they flex or cry etc. and is usually resolved naturally over time. They can also change over time; pregnancy can result in an &quot;inny&quot; becoming an &quot;outie&quot;, as can rapid stomach growth (read: weight gain).</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of questions here, I'm not a doctor (yet). I haven't really investigated the various reasons why a belly button might change orientation (or its racial specificity) but basically it's a fleshy leftover of the umbilicus, so it's quite flexible. Other than that I can't really give you guys a specific answer - I just happen to know the basics - sorry. The misconception referenced earlier is that doctors may somehow control whether or not a baby develops an &quot;inny&quot; or &quot;outie&quot; by adjusting where the umbilical cord is cut and clamped; this is not true. However, those with a significant disdain for their particular orientation of belly button can see a plastic surgeon to have it altered to their preference in a procedure known as an umblicoplasty. The umbilical hernia condition can be rectified without surgery over the course of the early development of the child but is typically handled with surgery if the condition hasn't gone away by the age of four. Those who develop these types of hernias later on in life simply have the misfortune of getting a hernia as any person may in the course of their life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So reading through here, it just hit me.  Where does the inside of the belly button connect to?  I mean the umbilical cord gets cut, yet it leads to the stomach while in the womb.  After it's cut, what happens to the inside of the belly button?  Does it just close off and create a sort of stomach button?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I can contribute something new to the thread!  </p>
<p>Some babies can get what’s called an “umbilical granuloma”. Once the umb. cord falls off, it (rarely) tries to grow back. This happened to my youngest (6mo) and we have to get it surgically removed. Hers essentially grew back to the size of a pea then dried up, luckily. They can get huge and gross looking. It’s now this tiny little nubbin — about the size of a plastic pin head—inside her chubby little belly button. </p>
<p>The Dr said we can leave it forever or remove it. Up to us. But I don’t think she’ll appreciate having it when she grows up. </p>
<p>I just tell people she’s extra ambitious. :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure genetics are a small factor. Like the genes that control how a scar heals. I've noticed black folks tend to have outies more often and their scaring tends to be more raised (which is why some tribes do scarification for aesthetic purposes). </p>
<p>No matter how well the cut is treated, some people just get thicker scaring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
