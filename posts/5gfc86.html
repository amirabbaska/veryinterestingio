		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big factor is the noise of the detector. Digital image sensors generate spurious &quot;detection&quot; events (due to thermal electron-hole pair generation). The noise level is determined by the semiconductor material, the number of defects, and the temperature. The light you are capturing needs to generate a signal that is more significant than the noise level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on a lot of factors, first of all you need to determine at what wavelength your photons are.<br />
Radio telescopes use very different mechanisms for the detection of photons, than say an optical telescope. If you're working with telescopes were the light is reflected many times before reaching the detector, then the reflectivity of the mirrors and other optics play a large role. As not all light is reflected, but some light is absorbed (here too the wavelength is somewhat important) by those optics.<br />
The detector itself has a certain efficiency as well, the so called &quot;Quantum Efficiency&quot;, which tells you what fraction of the incoming photons are converted to an electronic signal as a function of wavelength. How this exactly works is somewhat out of my reach of knowledge but it largely depends on the materials used on the detector.<br />
Not all photons that hit the surface area of the telescope do reach the detector. Some of them will hit the support structure (spider arms for example) or are cut-off by an aperture because of the light at the edge of the light beam is often unusable.<br />
Then finally, to be able to detect something, you also need to have a low enough noise floor, otherwise you won't be able to distinguish the signal from noise, this noise can be coming from thermal sources (important for (near)infrared)) or system noise, such as the read-out noise of a CCD detector.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what kind of telescope.  X-ray telescopes count individual photons.  So like 10 of them can count as a source detection if there's very little background (noise) photons.</p>
<p>For visible light telescopes, they don't count individual photons, so it's more difficult to say, but enough so that the current the pixels measure is much higher than that of the background.  And it depends on what statistical significance threshold people use to define a source detection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several things. The density of light sensing cells in the viewer's retina, the absolute radius and curvature of the capturing lens (or mirror), and possibly the interference made by imperfections in the  systems that are powering said telescope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about &quot;quantum efficiency&quot;. The fraction of photons falling on an imager which are actually detected by that imager. Modern CCDs have quantum efficiencies in the 80-90+ percent range, so detect significantly close to all photons that fall on them. However, that's not the whole story. There is some absorption, scattering, and loss of photons within the instrument. Additionally, there is noise in the electronics of sensors, noise in the individual pixel detectors and noise in the analog to digital converters.</p>
<p>To use a specific example, some of the Hubble Deep Field objects were detected based on receiving only around 1 photon per minute (collected over 11 days worth of observing time).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
