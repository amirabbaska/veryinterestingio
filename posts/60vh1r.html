		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cocaine gets absorbed by the mucus membranes in your nostrils, and crosses over directly into the blood stream.  This is why cocaine acts so much faster than say, alcohol.  Alcohol has to reach the small intestine before being absorbed in large amounts, which can take 15-30 minutes depending on your stomach contents.</p>
<p>Cocaine bypasses all of that by having a molecular structure that allows it to cross directly into the very small blood vessels (capillaries) in your nose, and then distribute into your body at a very rapid pace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that the answers so far have been about where the drug goes.  However we can assume that not all of the powder you're snorting is cocaine.  So where does THAT stuff go?  The stuff your body doesn't absorb?  </p>
<p>Post nasal drip.  It runs down the back of your throat in your mucus, similar to what happens with any dust particles you inhale inadvertently.  Only your throat and nose are numb, so you don't really notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything that gets you &quot;high&quot;, &quot;drunk&quot;, etc. has to go into the blood stream at some point, where the heart pumps it throughout the body. So it goes &quot;everywhere&quot; including your brain.</p>
<p>Some things can't get to the brain though. The brain has a protective layer known as the &quot;blood brain barrier&quot; (BBB). Only certain things can get through. Cocaine is one that can which is why you get euphoric from it.</p>
<p>Immodium, an over-the-counter diarrhea medicine is actually not much different from heroin or other strong opiates. The reason it doesn't get you high is because it can't cross the BBB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to the post up top - the Coke sits in Your nose and breaks down. It become engulfed into mucous where the mucous breaks it down even further to get rid of the foreign matter. It will turn into boogers/snot and you will either swallow it or blow it out into a Kleenex. After long periods of use it affects the mucous production and can actually break down Into an acid and damage your nasal passages.</p>
<p>Also cocaine is toxic to the heart because it works on the sodium/potassium pump ion channels that is mechanism responsible for the actual electrical conduction (pumping action) of the heart. There are much more sudden deaths caused by this  than say meth or heroin sniffers </p>
<p>I am speaking on the electrical conduction pathways in the heart. (Beginning in the right atrium, the SA is the point of electric conduction origin) <em>see cardiac action potential</em></p>
