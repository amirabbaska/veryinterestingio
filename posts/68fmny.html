		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although cults are religious groups typically, they have a lot of differences which are quite big.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadership: Whereas a religion may have a religious head and a hierarchical structure to it's system, a cult typically only has 1 or 2 leaders who make all the rules and who have absolute control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities: Cult members often live in groups or communes which brings them further into the cult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation: Many of these communes are isolated from the rest of society and members may be forced into cutting off communication with the outside world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coercion: Many inductees are mistreated and abused in order to establish a form of psychological control over their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recitation: Cult members aren't told how to interpret their religion, they're told the phrases and motos to reinforce it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective: Cult members are constantly told that if they remain loyal and do things for the cult that they will be elevated to the select few who can be enlightened/transcend/attain inner peace. However the goal posts are constantly moved back to keep the higher ups in absolute control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited Information: Whereas anyone can pick up a bible and more or less understand most of Christianity, cults only reveal small tidbits of their beliefs at every new level that a member reaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alienation: Cult members are constantly engrained with an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seclusion: Most cults are self sufficient so that members don't ever have to leave, and most of the time they're not allowed to anyways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expensive: Yes church can be expensive, but cults routinely ask for it's members to dedicate their whole live to the cause and to pay their &quot;dues&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Secretive: Cults never openly advertise about themselves, their beliefs, their leadership, or how they spend the money they receive from members. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Guys I get it, many religions do this to some extent or another. But the main point is that the governing bodies of cults actively participate in this behavior. Just because there are  congregations that practice these behaviors, doesn't make every church a cult. Cults are like pornography: you'll know it when you see it.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of conflation between cults and sects and there's plenty of reading online. But to give an answer to the <em>colloquial</em> understanding of cults...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One or two charismatic leaders - the cult usually dies with them. Religions do not rely on individuals such as this which is one of the reasons they last so much longer than cults, which almost always die within one or two generations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation - limited exposure to alternative ideas is an important part of keeping people indoctrinated. Sometimes this literally means creating an isolated community (think Jim Jones). Most religions are accepting of new members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High demands - while a religion usually demands very little, cults usually are quite demanding of their members, whether that demand is money, time, freedom, or whatever else. While some religions can also be very demanding, usually it is possible to follow it with a less demanding interpretation. Cults generally demand a lot of all members. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerable followers - it is simply not normal behaviour to join a cult and believe its teachings. Cults rely on the weak and vulnerable, and those easy to manipulate. Arguably you could say the same for religion, but a vulnerable person turning to religion is not the same as a cult preying on people. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strict rules - cults usually have fairly strict regulations on behaviour in the outside world. Religions are generally compatible with the modern lifestyle - they're so big that they need to either adapt or survive. Again this is one of the reasons cults tend to be quite short lived, because they are often incompatible with daily life.</p>
</li>
<li>Secretive - again, to keep people indoctrinated it helps to convince them that they have exclusive access to some special truth. This helps to neutralise threats to the ideology because you can simply claim &quot;well they don't know what we do&quot;. Religions on the other hand generally specifically aim to spread their message. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In popular use,  &quot;cult&quot; connotes a religion that partakes of the same constellation of characteristics that typify abusive relationships : authoritarian leadership, isolation from external support, questions or dissent are discouraged with threats and punishment, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, cult comes from Latin cultus which means, among other things, worship or religion. Only in the past few hundred years did the negative aspects of the word cult come about, before then &quot;the cult of Jesus&quot; would be basically synonyms with Christianity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are the simple/ basic parameters for a cult that I learned in Religions of the World: </p>
<ul>
<li>A group that loves something</li>
<li>A religion whose beliefs differ from the majority around them (Ex: Christians in the Roman Empire were considered cult members since they didn't worship Roman gods) </li>
<li>A religious group that is exclusive, secretive, authoritarian </li>
</ul>
<p>Expanding on the last three... </p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive: Might claim that they alone have the truth and that everyone else is wrong; if you leave the group your salvation will be in danger</li>
<li>Secretive: Certain teachings aren't available to outsiders or they're presented only to certain members of the group-- sometimes in confidentiality.</li>
<li>Authoritarian: A human leader expects total loyalty and unquestioned obedience </li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters probably answer the second part of your question as well, since cults endanger the lives/self-esteems of their members and, even if they don't, they're pretty hush-hush, leading to suspicion.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the People's Temple documentary? It's pretty good and shows how brainwashed and stuck people can get. Cults often prey on &quot;weaker&quot; people, like the elderly, those without relatives, vulnerable people... It's sad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
