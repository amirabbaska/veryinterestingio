		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much like the 'Fight or Flight' response related to real-world dangers and how we react to them, the brain has a hard time telling difference between a physical threat or a psychological one. </p>
<p>Anxiety and Nervousness can be as frightening mentally as a dark alley way or a guy with a knife across the street. </p>
<p>When your body goes into 'Fight or Flight' blood is moved away from the stomach and to areas where it might be used to run or fight, such as the legs or arms. Less activity in the abdominal region and an increase in adrenaline are some of the many causes to losing your appetite. </p>
<p>TLDR- Your body is allocating bodily resources effectively for a threat it perceives to be real and life threatening, but is really just mental anguish that it cannot differentiate.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To go along with other answer, your gut can also sometimes induce vomiting if you are under very heavy stress In order to free up even more resources for the fight or flight response. </p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system, I believe, is responsible for increased heart rate, faster breathing, and tightness in the gut in order to prepare you to respond to threats. Even though it may just be as simple as a math test. Our body releases the same stress hormone so we have the same reaction.</p>
<p>Even though the stress we feel today is mostly social anxiety stress or such, we still react as though we are physically in danger and food can wait to digest later. Surviving now is more important than getting a bite to eat to our brain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact response is determined by the type of anxiety or stress you’re feeling. </p>
<p>Long term stress such as a final coming up/big event you have to get ready for are handled by the internal medulla of the kidney. This area produces a “compliment” to adrenaline called cortisol. Cortisol causes you to have a large craving for fats and carbs so that your body has energy reserves for when the big event occurs. It expects you to be in a big fight or have to run far, so it can turn the fat stores into energy. Thats why stress eating is such a problem. It’s natural and can’t truly be fixed</p>
<p>The external kidney, the adrenal gland, produces adrenaline. Adrenaline acts to stim blood flow away from non-essential parts of your body to your lungs and heart so you can do things faster (important to note NOT LONGER). It primarily pulls it away from the gastro-intestinal region, the extremities, etc. </p>
<p>This is why great cold medicine uses pseudoephedrine. This copy of adrenaline is made as an extended release to open airways so you can get more oxygen and counter that stuff nose</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety is fun:</p>
<p>The liver releases sugars and fats which flow into the blood stream to provide energy.</p>
<p>Breathing becomes faster, providing more oxygen.</p>
<p>Heart beats faster and blood pressure rises to make sure blood reaches the areas needed.</p>
<p>Blood clotting mechanisms are activated in case of injury and bleeding.</p>
<p>Muscles tighten, ready to run or fight.</p>
<p>Saliva dries up and digestion stops so that more blood can be diverted to the muscles.</p>
<p>Sweating increases to cool the body.</p>
<p>Bowel and bladder muscles may become loose.</p>
<p>Pupils in the eyes widen to let in more light and help clearer vision.</p>
<p>All senses are heightened.</p>
<p>Brain thinks of other things that could be a threat.</p>
<p>Blood supply is diverted from the skin to reduce bleeding if injured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
