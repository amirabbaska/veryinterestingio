In the U.S. or Canada, many ingredients are allowed which have never been tested for their effects on human health.</p>
<p>I was wondering if that has actually translated into any differences in the rate of disease between these two regions. </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for this interesting discussion.

Cancer often has a latency time of 20 years or more.  </p>
<p>This is a big topic with a relatively new chemical safety law in Europe, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization (and Restriction) of Chemicals).  This was nominally one of the rationales for passage.  We will see in the long term whether or not it was effective.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like what is called an 'ecological study'. Countries wich allow these (unnamed) substances exhibit higher prevalences of unspecified cancer.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_study" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_study</a>
These are very weak studies, prone to massive effects of confounding. Comparing the EU (which is very diverse itself) to the US or Canada is not just comparing a region without these substances to one that allows them but there are innumerable other differences between these regions and no conclusions regarding causality can be drawn.</p>
<p>If studies have shown that an exposure to these substances means an increased cancer risk then that is powerful evidence for banning them. It is highly unlikely that the same substances are not carcinogenic to people in the US or Canada. Whether this compelling evidence actually exists has to be verified on a case-to-case basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A lot of these substances were banned because of allergic reactions in a small partition of the populace, as an example Azo compaunds ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound</a> ). The reasons for EU-USA bansa might be similar (relating to &quot;other harms&quot; in your question)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><strong><em>Conclusions: &quot;EDC exposures in the EU are likely to contribute substantially to disease and dysfunction across the life course with costs in the hundreds of billions of Euros per year. These estimates represent only those EDCs with the highest probability of causation; a broader analysis would have produced greater estimates of burden of disease and costs.&quot;</em></strong></p>
