		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has everything to do with kidney development and brain development. In infants, the process is not under conscious control. Infants also have an entirely liquid diet for the first 4-6 months. The bladder is small and the urine is very dilute, so these babies pee 10-14 times per day or more. As the kidneys develop over the years, the urine can become more concentrated. The bladder grows in size, and so does the brain! As the brain develops, the child can eventually gain conscious control of elimination. This typically happens in the second and third years of life. It takes practice, so the skill is not perfected until the fifth or sixth year. Some children may still have underdeveloped kidneys in their preschool and early school years--if the kidneys are not concentrating urine, they will be more prone to accidents and bed wetting. Don't punish your children for these accidents, have their kidney function tested.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Production of the Antidiuretic hormone, which regulates urine production and concentration.  These levels are higher when you sleep, making it easier to sleep through the night without having a full bladder.  ADH is prescribed for prevention of bed wetting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least part of this is genetic. When asleep your body secrets low anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) which slows the creation of urine by the kidneys. At what state of development this hormone starts to be secreted varies between people and is to some degree genetically regulated. Children who wet the bed are known to have lower ADH than their peers. Once the ADH levels increase the problem generally resolves itself.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You learned how to control the external sphincters that make you release yourself.
Others have also explained that hormones play a part in it as well.</p>
<p>Basically everything in your body has a sphincters, or valves, that allow it to move from one place to another.
From your esophagus to your stomach, stomach to small intestines, etc
Your veins have valves too, so that your retuning blood (headed towards the heart) doesn't backflow down from the direction it came from (or up if it's coming from above your heart).</p>
<p>Young children can't control it that well because the sphincters are too weak to control.
It also has to do with potty training &amp; forcing your brain to know when &amp; where to do your business.
Some adults might even wet the bed if their peeing dream is so strong that they unintentionally relieve themselves IRL.</p>
<p>As for adults who sometimes accidentally wet themselves &amp; it's not dream-based, that's due to medical issues or them just getting too old &amp; becoming weaker.
That's another topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
