		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put you have thousands of pounds of liquid oxygen and kerosene (or other fuel) arranged in pressurized tanks that are brought into contact and burned at enormous rates.  This creates massive amounts of heat and pressure that has to be directed out the nozzle to produce the thrust of the rocket.  All the while the very combustion is creating massive vibration that is shaking every part of the rocket.  </p>
<p>Thus you have to construct a vehicle filled with explosive propellants, that are burned precisely in the right proportions.  The rocket has to be strong enough to withstand the vibrations and also as light as possible to maximize payload. </p>
<p>The current rockets for the most part were developed after many massive failures and once a working solution was found in a rocket design, then payloads were developed to match the capabilities of the launch vehicles.</p>
<p>Probably the worst such failure was the Soviet Nedelin Disaster....</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rockets are simple! You need fuel(fuel tank), a way to get the fuel to the place you burn it(turbopump), a place to burn fuel(combustion chamber), and a nozzle for the hot gasses to expand in(the bell)</p>
<p>The trick is making a combustion chamber that can withstand 20 MPa while at a toasty 3200 C!</p>
<p>The core principles are simple, building a big rocket engine is much more of a material sciences problem than a fundamental layout challenge</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pumping: You need lightweight pumps that can move enormous amounts of reactive (and possibly cryogenic) liquid. For large rockets they partially combust the propellants and drive a turbine at high speed with the (hot, reactive) gas, and try to run the pumps off the same shaft (tricky, because of cavitation issues). The pumps and plumbing must be also robust with respect to the motions of the vehicle (unexpected oscillations in the plumbing were part of why the soviet moon rocket N1 failed).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Combustion Stability: The combustion phenomena are prone to feedback. The injectors need to be designed in such a way as to prevent vibrations from developing and destroying the engine. AFAIK this is very much a trial and error process. This was famously a problem for the V2 and the (Saturn V booster) F1. Basically each time they scaled up the technology.</p>
</li>
<li>Cooling: Good rockets run at absurdly high temperatures and flow rates. The chamber and throat of the engine are usually actively cooled by running propellant through passages in the engine wall. This is an easier problem than the others, with less trial and error involved, but still annoying. IIRC, the fuel for the V2 had to be watered down to be a better coolant, and on the N1 part of the reason the soviets used super-toxic propellants is that the kerosene they had available wouldn't work to cool an engine for prolonged periods.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hardest part would be the turbopump, which has to tolerate extremely high temperatures at one end, and extremely cold temperatures at the other, while spinning extremely fast. It's basically a fuel pump and engine that's several thousand to tens of thousands of horsepower, just pumping fuel into the main combustion chamber. In some designs the hot end is also in a highly corrosive environment(hot oxygen)</p>
<p>The combustion chamber has to be designed to burn all that fuel and oxidizer uniformly, without melting or corroding.</p>
<p>Basically, the design is relatively simple, but you're really pushing the limits on what the materials are capable of.</p>
<p>You can make a simple rocket engine in your garage, but making a high performance low weight one is an entirely different beast.</p>
<p>If you want a bit of perspective, the F1 engine on the Saturn V is the size of a car, and its fuel pump alone is something like 50,000 horsepower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
