		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes they (can) do, because volcanic islands can host depositional environments for sedimentary rocks. Just because an island has a volcanic origin does not mean that sedimentary rocks are unable to form. Many volcanic islands in the tropics will host carbonate reefs that record fragments of the island's palaeontological history. Even terrestrial life can be recorded. Although volcanically active islands are not particularly good at preserving sedimentary rocks because (as with all topographically prominent features on the Earth's surface) they tend to be erosional rather than depositional, some depositional environments may remain such as river channels, lakes, and dunes. Volcaniclastic deposits such as ignimbrites and other mass flow deposits may also preserve a palaeontological record.</p>
<p>I'll illustrate this with a few examples. If you look at a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/501134e9c4aa430673203999/t/552c1c1ee4b0b6a944884c03/1428954147675/geology+with+copyright.JPG" target="_blank">geological map of Bermuda</a>, you'll see that the entire surface is made of sedimentary rock. But Bermuda is actually a volcanic island - the carbonate rocks (and associated dunes) that make up the modern island were actually originally formed as a large platform on top of an ancient volcano that once rose over 2km above the sea surface. Another example is <a href="http://madeiraislands.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/madeira-geologic-map.jpg" target="_blank">Madeira</a>, which was geologically active more recently than Bermuda and is in waters too cold for coral reefs. Nevertheless, even Madeira preserves sedimentary rocks in the form of some ancient carbonates (which have since been uplifted to over a kilometre above sea level). There are also occasional fluvial deposits that can be found intercalated with the volcanic deposits that dominate the island's geology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be difficult to get fossils on volcanic islands, because while deposition definitely takes place, erosion is high and to be honest the islands just don't last that long, geologically speaking.  But especially, eg, in inland lake sediments you can find fossils and pollen records. Fossils can be found in caves on the islands as well.  </p>
<p>But a lot of evolutionary histories are determined by making phylogenitic trees of living organisms.  It's common for species radiations to happen on islands, so you have a lot of related species that are descended from one species, often spread across the islands.  By comparing them, you can get an idea of their evolutionary history.  </p>
<p>For example, here's a series of tree snails  <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1508/3363.figures-only" target="_blank">http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1508/3363.figures-only</a>
derived from DNA testing showing how they've moved between islands, based on genetic relationships</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Corals growing on top of volcanic platforms or uplifted islands due to tectonic effects can be used to track uplift rates. Alternately, since the corals are preserved as they are lifted, the sequence can be used to reconstruct climate and sea level using isotope proxies.</p>
<p>As far as animal preservation, most of the fossils are likely going to be shallow marine like corals, shelled animals, or imprints from worm burrows. The sedimentation rate and environment on land is unlikely to capture and preserve terrestrial animals well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are refering to basalt being the cast instead of sediments then yes but not as well, the lava has a tendency of destroying small fragile fossils, but if something happens to be in water like a dead tree, the lava can encase it and petrify it over time leaving behind a fosile with detail so precice you would have thought it was real wood. </p>
<p>But lava like this covers a lot of ground and burries and destroys most fossiles. Central washigton had a lava erruption 12-15 million years ago that released  over 40,000 cubic miles of basalt lava, the largest island of hawaii is 10,000 cubic miles from ocean floor to mountain top. </p>
<p>The basalt floods in washigton burried 200 million year old mountain range under 3 miles of lava that only took about 400,000 years to form, so the animal/plant life in between the interbeds of the flows where destroyed by 100ft walls of crushing lava that swept through, the heat also melted the interbeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A specific example: Kauai is the oldest of the main Hawaiian islands and has the only limestone cave in the state. Here a husband-and-wife team spent 25 years excavating the cave/sinkhole and reconstructing the last 8,000 years of natural and human history on the island. They only got about 8,000 years because that's when the roof of the cave fell in - so there are 8,000 years of sediment in the cave. It's a really cool place to visit. Kauai is about 5 million years old, so the cave only provides a recent snapshot. But there's a great book about it written by one of the scientists who worked there, Dave Burney. <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300172096/back-future-caves-kauai" target="_blank"><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300172096/back-future-caves-kauai" target="_blank">https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300172096/back-future-caves-kauai</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
