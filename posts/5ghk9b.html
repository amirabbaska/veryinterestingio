		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need an extremely varied diet to become muscley. You need calories and protein. We don't synthesize all the proteins we need in our body from grass so we need to get them from different sources (animal meat, combinations of different vegetable sources, etc). Bison get the protein and calories they need from the grass they eat because their digestive system is equipped to get more of the calories locked into the cellulose of the plant matter and they synthesize the proteins that they need out of the grass they eat.</p>
<p>The reason you need a varied diet is so you don't die from malnutrition because you lack B12 or vitamin K or something. Those things aren't necessarily required to become extremely muscular, but they are required to not die/suffer diseases from malnutrition.</p>
<p>Edit: I also forgot the fairly obvious point the bison spend the majority of their waking time eating. Even with the better equipped digestive system you need to eat large volumes of grass to get substantial calories out of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>2) they have a very complicated digestive system, with <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aXkbbcooFIg/VP47YG5PQdI/AAAAAAAAAPw/TleY_8dcPyI/s1600/cow%2Bstomach.jpg" target="_blank">4 stomachs</a> that allow them to get all the nutrients from the grass.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants actually have <em>a lot</em> more protein than meats, which is why the majority of megafauna are herbivores, but a great deal of that protein isn't bioavailable to some species, such as humans. Or to put it another way, plants are a superior source of food compared to meats <em>if you have a stomach that can digest them fully</em>. Humans don't -- although we can get by fine on very little meat -- but bison do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good answers here but the base answer is 'because Bison evolved to do exactly that, eat grass all day and become huge and muscular' because that, in itself, gives their offspring the greatest chance to survive. If humans lived like the vast majority of humans have lived historically, they would be lean and able to run long distances. This, historically, along with our ability to use tools, is what allows our offspring to have the best chance to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But you have a brain that is capable of asking this question and that is a good trade-off in my opinion, check out <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/suzana_herculano_houzel_what_is_so_special_about_the_human_brain" target="_blank">this great TED talk</a> about our brains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
