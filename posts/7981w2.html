		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even accounting for fabric softener, I feel like air dried towels are more absorbent than machine dried.  I could understand if machine dried towels were just more efficiently dried, but wouldn't they then dry out further while sitting in the linen closet? Regardless of the surroundings they were stored in,  line dried seem to be more absorbent. Why is that? </p>
<p>Edit: looks like the consensus is that machine dried towels should be more absorbent than air dried, so there is something wrong with my dryer. Also, white vinegar in the wash cycle to remove fabric softener residue. Thanks for all the info, reddit. </p>
<p>I'm honestly amazed that so many people have such strong opinions about this.</p>
<p>Edit: re fabric softener. When I said I accounted for it when I asked this question,  I just meant that I normally add it to the rinse cycle in the wash, so the towels theoretically have them same amount on them regardless if I then line or machine dry the towels. </p>
<p>Edit: Alright,  Reddit. You win. I've now spent my Saturday washing my towels with vinegar. Instead of fabric softener,  my house smells like pickles. I hope you're happy. </p></div></div>

<p>I used to work for a cleaning contractor, and our microfibre cloths would become worthless if we forgot, and added a sheet of downy! They would also streak the hell out of mirrors and windows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Problem is that you can't &quot;account for fabric softener&quot; the way you think you can.  What I find is that both softener and, particularly, dryer sheets, leave a residue on the inside of the dryer's drum that gets picked up by the load that follows it.  You have to run two unsoftened loads in a row, typically, for the second load to start to approach full absorbency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be because machine drying will somewhat compress the fibers in the towel. A towel absorbs water by absorbing water into the microscopic spaces between fibers. Water is drawn and held there basically by capillary action. If the fibers are compressed by being machine dried, there is less space, and the towel will absorb less water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Towels are basically the same thing as a cloth diaper. I know from laundering cloth diapers that you cannot use fabric softener. The substance that fabric softener is made out of clogs and coats the pores on the cotton and other material. Also if you've ever tried to water a potted plant that is too dry, you'll know that water likes water and dry does not. Over-drying towels, especially to the point of static, which happens often in my dryer, makes it so that it's not as absorbent as if you had stopped sooner or line dried. Line dried towels would then tend to be a bit rougher but much more absorbent. There's also that lovely smell of fresh line dried laundry... ❤️</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water attracts water. Towels act through capillary action, so the faster the water can travel through the towel the better it will be at absorbing liquid. </p>
<p>So when you go to wipe up a spill, a slightly damp cloth will be more effective because it's already primed to absorb the liquid.</p>
<p>An air-dried towel will retain the same moisture as the surrounding air, more or less. A machine-dried towel will be much drier than an air-dried towel, so it will take longer to absorb the same amount of liquid.</p>
<p>So it's not really about how absorbent they are, as the dryer towel will actually absorb slightly more liquid, it's that the damp towel will more readily absorb the liquid much quicker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
