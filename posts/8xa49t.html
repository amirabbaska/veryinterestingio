<p>With current temperatures at record heights and droughts effecting farming crops and livestock where I'm from (Ireland) other than cost, what other limitations are there with desalination?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to piggy back off that link you posted. If you read the response from Suzanne Sullivan, she gives good info on the new technology emerging regarding graphene filters. Currently one of the issues with desalination involves efficiency. It takes so much salt-water and so much electricity to produce drinkable water. With developments like nanoporous graphene, and better solar tech ( the newest tech involves multiple cells focusing on different light spectrums in place of one cell focusing on all in the same cell space) efficiency will go up making practicality higher as well as costs lower. The other issue sheer infrastructure. I think the best way to see a real world example of distribution costs is to look up those natural gas pipelines that run across the country. We see in the news all the time about leaks, expensive costs to build, encroachments on private properties, and end mile installation costs. Imagine a city like Los Angeles (pop. 4 million); according to the CA-LAO government website residents use 109 gallons a day per person in the warmer months. That's 436 million gallons per day. The biggest desalination plant operating today produces 228 million gallons a day in Riyadh and cost 7.2 billion to build. So we would not only need two of those just for LA, but enough real estate to place it as well as enough electricity to power it. Let's imagine how much power is needed to power 2 plants so they can produce 456 million gallons of water a day, just for LA. </p>
<p>So while the tech is available, the biggest limitation is efficiency. By being able to use a  cheap and efficient source of electricity, with improved filtering processes, one day we can remove the current limitations we face today. Right now desalination works for small applications (ships, oil rigs, rural populated areas) but in order to make it work for large desert cities like LA, we need to work on the above things first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Desalination is mainly performed using reverse osmosis (RO) plants. The general principle of the process is pumping water into reverse osmosis membrane stacks (often reaching 60bar operating pressure), where the salts are filtered and desalinated water exits as a permeate at the end of the stacks. </p>
<p>The process of desalination (and therefore the costs of such a plant - including both equipment and operation costs) varies with water quality and, as expected, the desired water yield. Long story short, salt water is more expensive to process than brackish water, which in turn is more expensive than freshwater (obviously) due to higher pressures required, that translate to certain requirements for pumps, membrane types, etc, plus the fact that the yield is lower as salt content goes up. Last but not least, one should also consider that RO plants have certain requirements on the water that arrives at the intake of the RO. This means that sedimentation filters and possibly water softeners are required, contributing to the costs as well.</p>
<p>Closing my comment, as far as water purification is concerned, EDI (Electrodeionization) is a relatively new technology, which is however mostly used as a follow-up to RO, to produce ultrapure water for, mostly, industrial use in, say, cosmetics etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>in russia they are building floating nuclear power stations that can serve multiple purposes, one of them is providing electricity and heat for a city of up to 200 000 people OR produce 240 000 cubic METER per day of freshwater. That would be enough to supply around a million people with an average daily spendage of water, 1 showers a day, cooking, cleaning, etc, just a normal life, on &quot;drought&quot; economy this could easily be stretched 3-4 times the amount of people.</p>
<p>a lot of people only see the negative aspects of a floating power plant, but there are plenty of those around in the worlds navies, they are also used in the nuclear powered icebreakers used by russia of which 8 are in operation still (from what i found). so instead of seeing the risks that are few or manageable (the end-all contingency plan is to just sink the ship/platform in case of emergency) people should be able to see the humanitarian utility of such vessels</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a chemistry perspective, the two main issues are energy efficiency and brine.</p>
<p>Separating water and salt doesn't just create fresh drinking water, it also necessarily concentrates the salt in whatever seawater is left over. This takes energy. </p>
<p>Pushing the water through a selective membrane is a hell of a lot more efficient than boiling it, but it's still an incredibly energy intensive process. We've got better membranes now, that dont get clogged as easily, and the price of solar is still dropping, but its still a crapload of energy.</p>
<p>Then there's the brine. This is even saltier than seawater. Yes you can just put it back into the ocean, but you need to deal with what it does to your equipment first. It's even more corrosive to metal than seawater, and depending on how much you concentrated it, salt crystals can form that are really bad for pumps, membranes and anything that needs to hold pressure like valves. And if you spill any significant quantity of it on land, not much will grow there for awhile. What this means in practical terms is very labour intensive maintenace and frequent part replacements, all of which cost time and money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
