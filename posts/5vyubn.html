		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Becquerel and Curie are units of activity. This is just the rate at which a radioactive sample is decaying. They tell you the number of disintegrations happening per unit time.</p>
<p>The rad is a unit of dose. It's just an amount of energy deposited into some material by some radiation per unit mass of the object.</p>
<p>The Sievert is a unit of dose equivalent. It's the same as above, except it's corrected for the fact that different kinds of radiation are more damaging than others, for a given energy.</p>
<p>The Roentgen is a unit of exposure. Since we're talking about ionizing radiation, it produces free charge when it interacts with matter. The amount of charge released per unit mass of the object is the exposure.</p>
<p>In nuclear physics, you'll see Bequerels (Curies are sort of dated) whenever there's radioactive decay. Safety regulations are usually quoted in terms of Sievert or REM (Roentgen equivalent man, another unit of dose equivalent).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of all the different aspects of radiation. For one there's the rate of radiation &quot;events&quot;. There's also the amount of energy released via radiation per unit time, which is related to the rate of radiation events but varies depending on the type of radiation and the specifics. But that's a sterile view of radiation, often what we want to know is how it impacts human beings and the potential health effects. So you want to know how much energy or impact that radiation has on a human body. You might consider something simplistic like the amount of energy deposited in a material, but that ignores that not all radiation has the same health effects, some is more damaging than others. So you could created another figure that tells you how serious a given radiation exposure is to a human body, adjusted based on the effective damage caused by different kinds of radiation. Meanwhile, you have to ask how you measure these values? So you have measurements that might be easy to do but might require a lot of work to translate into other figures.</p>
<p>And that's how we have so many different units of radiation.</p>
<p>Becquerels are units of <em>activity</em>, they tell you the rate of total disintegrations per second. Curies measure the same thing but in different units.</p>
<p>In terms of &quot;absorbed dose&quot; there's the rad, which is equal to 100 ergs/gram (an erg is a unit of energy), 100 rads = 1 Joule/kg which is also one &quot;Gray&quot;. Same thing, different sizes of units.</p>
<p>The roentgen is a measurement related to ionizing radiation, the amount of ionization of the air caused by radioactivity. It's one of those things that exists because it was easy to measure, and bore a close enough relation to other figures to be worthwhile. 1 roentgen is roughly equivalent to about 0.9 rad, depending on certain factors.</p>
<p>Then you have doses that take into account the different types of radiation, which is where the rem and sievert come in. For, say, beta radiation, 1 rem = 1 rad. And a sievert is simply 100 rem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
