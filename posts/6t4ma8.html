		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The powder bacteria you get is much like baker's yeast or &quot;astronaut ice cream&quot; that you can buy in the store. The bacteria are freeze-dried or, the more technical term, lyophilized. The main idea is to remove all the water to prevent spoilage which happens from biological activity which in turns requires water. First the sample is frozen so that all metabolic activity is stopped, and then a vaccum is pulled so that the water sublimates (goes directly from ice to gas) which keeps all of the other molecules that make up the cells frozen in place. After all the water is gone, the cells just remain a dry jumble of salts,proteins,lipids, etc. until water is added again.</p>
<p>The bacteria are no longer really &quot;alive&quot; in that they perform no chemical reactions without the water. They can't eat, they can't reproduce, they can't make more of anything. So there is no need for food. My guess is that the expiration date is only there because after a long time, moisture will seep back in.</p>
<p>The coming back to life part is tricky, but luckily single cell organisms are just bags of chemicals in water. So they are relatively easily dried and reconstituted. Much of the cells do die in the process, but it does not matter, as long as there is enough to make it past your stomach, even a few bacteria can turn into billions very quickly once they settle in the guy. Cryoprotectants are often added in the process, and a common one is trehalose (a sugar that's chosen because its cheap). The sugars help keep ice crystals to a minimum size during the freezing step. If the water crystalizes into large crystals, they can rupture the membranes or break proteins that would severely limit the ability of the bacteria to come back to life once rehydrated (because ice is less dense than water).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Lyophilization (basically freeze drying) can be performed on many bacterial species in order to convert them to powder. Some of the bacteria die, but enough remain so that they can start growing again under the right conditions.</p>
<p>For more information, I recommend this paper:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909163/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909163/</a></p>
<p>Additionally, some bacteria form spores, which can withstand harsh conditions. These are particularly easy to store as powder (think anthrax letters). However, the typical bacteria given as probiotics are not spore-forming.</p>

How come they don't reproduce until they're eaten by us?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyophilized bacteria are metabolically inactive. As long as the cells aren't damaged, they can be revived upon rehydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these products containing &quot;good bacteria&quot; often contain madeup names for bacteria that don't exist (biffidum digestivum) at all, or do nothing at all for the human digestive system, because the stomach destroys them long before they can reach the intestines.</p>
<p>Danone and other companies are regularly fined large sums of money for these fake bacteria scams but the fines are vastly lower than the profits to be made, so they keep on running fake adverts with insane claims of health etc.</p>
<p>Consider this - if &quot;good&quot; bacteria could survive the stomach acid, then &quot;bad&quot; bacteria would eventually evolve this ability as well.....</p>
