		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This wiki article is my favorite that addresses it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology</a>)</p>
<p>It basically talks about how there is a part of our brain that appears to be &quot;speaking&quot; and a part that &quot;obeys&quot;</p>
<p>Much like when you are very nervous or unsure and ask yourself &quot;Am I really going to do this?&quot; And you truly don't know but then you somehow decide and either do it or don't!</p>
<p>It also mentions how this type of inner dialog may have influenced humans view of religion because they literally heard someone telling them what to do. Like the voice of God &quot;Go find food and water, you can do it&quot; and as this part of our brain evolved it became more of a part of us and less &quot;disconnected&quot; </p>
<p>I definitely recommend checking out the link.
:)</p>
<p>Edit: As I stated in the 1st sentence this is my favorite article that addresses it.
I did not state that this is true or scientifically sound.  Its interesting and talks about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's 'hearing voices' and there's your internal monologue.</p>
<p>One is some people's stream of consciousness - the way they think - in a verbal way rather than visual way.</p>
<p>The other is often a symptom of schizophrenia or a hallucination.</p>
<p>Whether these two things are linked is an interesting question. i.e is the fact that I recognise my inner voice as my own thoughts the only thing that differs?</p>
<p>I believe this inner voice is (at least one of the things) that Buddhists are trying to escape from by meditating. Which I don't really understand. e.g I was out walking last night and I constantly converse with myself, think of different ideas and mull things as I'm doing that, to the point where I can have covered a large distance without really being aware. To me that's what makes activities like cycling and walking relaxing.</p>
<p>Whereas it seems to be that Buddhists believe that ignoring your thoughts and instead trying to focus on being in the moment is important.</p>
<p>Perhaps a lot depends upon what kind of thoughts you have. If you're fretting and anxious about things maybe you would want to escape it. I can't help thinking that a lot of epiphanies in maths and physics were reached by this kind of inner conversation - I'm sure most of us are thinking about more mundane things though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's the part of your brain that both thinks in sentences and recognizes language, a large part of which is a piece of meat known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area" target="_blank">Broca's area</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
