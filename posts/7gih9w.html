		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food spoilage is mostly caused by bacteria and fungi in the environment. </p>
<p>There are a lot of them naturally present, and generally don't harm the plant or animal that they're living on. But when that organism dies, it literally becomes the Hunger Games. </p>
<p>The microbes start ripping apart the nutrients present in the dead organism, and creating environments that kill as many of their competitors as possible. </p>
<p>Some of that competition is good for humans: pickles, vinegar, cheese, bread, and plenty of other foods are basically just us picking the winner in those Hunger Games. We give the microbes we like (L. Plantarum, etc) a nudge that helps them kill their competitors that we don't like (C. Botulinum, etc). </p>
<p>But, what does that have to do with canning? </p>
<p>Canning is the &quot;kill everything&quot; strategy. The food is completely sterilized and all microbes are killed. Good guys, bad guys, it doesn't matter. Kill everything with fire (literally with fire, if you're using gas heat). With everything dead, there's no Hunger Games, and the food doesn't get digested by them -- it stays fresh forever. </p>
<p>... if it's sterile. </p>
<p>If the strategy is to kill everything, you have to make sure that not one single microbe survives. That's hard to do. C. Botulinum in particular is a tough little bastard, can kill you, and you've killed all the L. Mesenteroides and other &quot;good guys&quot; who might have fought against it. For that reason most commercial canned foods include some additional preservatives -- the &quot;chemicals&quot; -- that people complain about. </p>
<p>But those chemicals are important for the reasons I described. Canning tries to kill every last living thing in the food product, and if there's a single survivor you'll die eating it -- a little chemical help makes sure that there are no survivors. </p>
<p>(Edit: Corrected some typos that people have pointed out. Thanks for all the positive comments! And, I'll stand by my use of &quot;literally&quot; here, so don't bother complaining more about it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there is bacteria everywhere right? This bacteria causes food to spoil. Once you put food in a can and create a hermetic seal (fancy term for saying nothing gets in or out, not even air), you have to cook the can. It is cooked in a giant pressure cooker with steam until all of the dangerous bacteria is killed off. The food will last as long as the seal. For a canned good, the seam is made of 5 layers of metal. When stored at room temperature, if the coating on the can is good, canned goods should last indefinitely, however there will be a small drop in quality after 2 to 3 years. Highly acidic products can eat through the can coating after a while, and have shorter shelf life as a result. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's 3 main ways of preserving food, all of which can be very effective. </p>
<p>The first, canning, focuses on killing all the bacteria in a product, then sealing it so no new bacteria can get in. Irradiation is another form of the same concept. </p>
<p>The second is altering the environment such that the bacteria there can't grow. That can be by removing water, adding sugar or salt in large amounts, or otherwise making it inhospitable. </p>
<p>The final way is fermentation. The goal here is to stack the deck such that desirable organisms can outcompete the bad guys and prevent them from taking hold. Also, things like lactic acid (pickles) and alcohol (beer and wine) can help create an environment where other stuff can't grow. </p>
<p>The very best ways of preserving things would likely be a combination of all three. For example, beer is boiled (type 1) with hops, which has some antimicrobial properties (type 2) fermented (type 3) then carefully sealed (type 1). A beer recovered from a shipwreck proved drinkable after 200 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though canning (whether in cans or jars) can preserve some foods for a long while because canning typically sterilizes food, dehydration or other methods can be even more effective (consider the case of canned spaghetti).  </p>
<p>As an aside, &quot;best by&quot; and &quot;use by&quot; dates often have nothing to do with how quickly the food will go bad.  Instead, they're often defined by how long the <em>packaging</em> can be expected to remain intact.  This is why bottled water has an expiration date, for example, and why you can eat long-expired food so long as the packaging is still sealed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
