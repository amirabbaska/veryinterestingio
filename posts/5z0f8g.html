		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things: </p>
<p>First, evolutionary psychologists think of pain as having two functions. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Preventing immediate damage</strong>. If you keep walking on your broken leg, you will do more permanent damage to it. Pain discourages you from moving now. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Teaching</strong>. Some painful events do not prevent further damage, but teach you to avoid similar situations in the future. Gastrointestinal pain does not help you avoid immediate damage (for the most part), but the memory of the pain will stop you from eating that poisonous mushroom again. </li>
</ol>
<p>So, contrary to how the question is formulated, the function of pain is not to indicate damage.</p>
<p>Second, &quot;damage&quot; here needs to be understood evolutionarily. Cheesecake probably does the average overweight person damage to their body, but it is extremely pleasurable. </p>
<p>&quot;Damage&quot; to the body are those changes to the body that would've made that conspecific (specific individual organism) less fit in its environment of evolutionary adaptiveness (the environment in which it evolved its current form). Scratching off dead skin cells wouldn't have made us less fit, whereas breaking an arm and moving it before it healed would have. So scratching isn't painful, just like cheesecake isn't painful, whereas moving a broken arm is painful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itching may promote scratching and scratching may sometimes be unhealthy. But itching also promotes awareness and the knowledge that attention to a problem is warranted.  </p>
<p>Sometimes the itching tells us to remove or otherwise react to an irritation such as a bug or thorn. Swatting or scratching off the irritant could suffice.   </p>
<p>Although sometimes our scratching causes damage, we are better off with an itch reaction than without.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scratching isn't always bad for you.</p>
<p>Itchy need to scratch sensations also alert you to insects and parasites (so does tickling) and scratching would remove them. Same reason dogs and bears scratch themselves. Scratching would also remove layers of grime from the body and let the skin breath.</p>
<p>I also think our ancestor's skin was much much tougher and leathery than our civilized, showered, sun-screened and moisturized hides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, and much of the world today, parasites living on the skin were common, and caused an itch. Scratching is a way of removing them that does less damage than the creature living on you.<br />
(note: this is a bad idea for ticks, which should be removed with a specialised tool.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
