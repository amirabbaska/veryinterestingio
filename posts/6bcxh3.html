<p>I realize evolution takes a while, so the natural corals in place can't keep up to their environments' changing, but if coral grow in all different environments and depths through the world, why can't marine biologists engineer new, more heat-hardy algae and coral then stimulate them to grow in the dead reefs?</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the first person to think of this, so what's standing in the way? Why is there this upper limit on temperature when there doesn't seem to be a lower limit, since corals can grow deeper?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually being experimented with right now. Designing new coral and zoozanthellae is still in the realm of science fiction. However, there are numerous labs working on artificially selecting heat and co2 tolerant genotypes of important reef building corals. The hope being, that we can accelerate the process of natural selection to keep pace with our changing environment. </p>
<p>This is contingent on numerous factors, however, that are difficult to overcome. </p>
<p>1) Sexual reproduction in corals is a tricky thing to get right in a lab setting, although we are getting better at it.</p>
<p>2) this is a new field and it's just getting off the ground</p>
<p>3) It's very expensive and there is still very limited funding</p>
<p>4) we don't know if it is going to work. It's possible that the species we are losing are simply not going to be able to survive the conditions they are facing.</p>
<p>5) our government is not willing to accept the magnitude of the problem</p>
<p>There is still hope that coral reefs can be saved world wide. They won't be the same ecosystems that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years, but they may hopefully still exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
