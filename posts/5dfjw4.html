		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The balloon won't drift anywhere from the ISS's reference frame due to a gravitational buoyancy effect.</p>
<p>However, if the balloon is placed anywhere other than the ISS's center of mass, the balloon will drift due to being in a different orbit than the ISS. The acceleration relative to the ISS center of mass is on the order of 10^(-5) m/s^2 or so (literally a micro-g). At the ISS center of mass, one expects the balloon to experience a rotational acceleration due to the same effect. The buoyancy relative to the ISS center of mass frame created by this is small as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's some acceleration the balloon will experience due to airflow on the ISS, but I do not know its strength (though it's undoubtedly much stronger than the above effect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the air in the ISS is stagnant, no it wouldn't float anywhere it would just sit still. The only exception is if the station was accelerating. If thrusters were switched on to make an orbital correction then the balloon would float in the direction that the station was accelerating.</p>
<p>Side note, you can see the same effect in a car. If you hold a helium balloon with a string in a car, and you accelerate forward, the balloon will try to move forward. This is because the air in the car resists acceleration and gets scrunched up in the back. Since air pressure is higher in the back of the car than the front, it pushes the balloon forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Balloons float on earth because there is a lower density of air the higher you go. Since helium is less dense than our lower atmosphere, the balloon goes up until it finds equilibrium. On the ISS, if all the vents are turned off and we ignore orbital effects, the balloon will remain stationary wherever you put it becaus the station has equal air pressure everywhere.   </p>
<p>Of course the ship is nothing like what I described. In reality it would go wherever the vents are blowing/sucking air. That would probably be the biggest effect on where the balloon drifted. Barring that, slight differences in the orbit of the balloon and he station would cause it to drift towards one of the walls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
