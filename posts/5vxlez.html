If within the next five years everyone or a significant majority began saving at rates between 10-20% wouldn't we see a decline in consumer spending sufficient to cause an economic depression? Wouldn't this wipe out those same savings?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I don't think it would be enough to cause an economic depression.  To quote from a Mr. Money Mustache (Early retirement blogger) article:</p>
<p>&quot;Newspaper reporters often repeat the phrase that consumers are the engine of economic growth in the United States. They say it so often that most people believe it, as witnessed by the quotes above. But when you read books written by economists (who in general know more about economics than newspaper reporters), they tell you that consumers are not the engine of economic growth. They are actually the caboose.</p>
<p>What is the engine of growth, then? It is the savers and investors. Only by sacrificing current consumption, can people put money into banks or share offerings, which end up in the hands of new and existing businesses who can then use that money to create new technology, factories, or human capital, allowing them to increase their productivity. Capital creates productivity, and productivity is the driver of our standard of living.&quot;</p>
<p>He has a lot more detail in the article, but that's the jist of it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of confusion in this thread - and not just here, you see it in a lot of &quot;economic&quot; journalism - between the drivers of short-term economic fluctuations (booms, busts, recessions) and the drivers of long-term growth. </p>
<p>The economy has a certain level of potential output: that is what would be produced if all workers were fully employed (except those who are temporarily out of a job because they're looking for work), all  factories produced at full capacity, all service businesses provided as much service as they can etc. This grows (we think) more or less steadily over time as workers enter the workforce, factories are constructed etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes the economy is below potential (as signified, for example, by a high rate of unemployment). Sometimes, more rarely, it's above (this can cause inflation). </p>
<p>If people suddenly stop spending as much, and save more, this will reduce GDP, because whatever they would have spent it on won't get made or sold. If spending falls enough, we might have a recession. But it shouldn't affect potential output. Eventually the economy should adjust (e.g. from a fall in prices) and we'll get back to potential, even at the higher level of savings.</p>
<p>And more savings should, eventually, lead to higher growth, because there will be more resources available for investment - new factories, new software, etc - which will support a higher level of potential output. </p>
<p>So the answer to your question is, yes, in the short term, there would be a recession, but if the overall level of savings increases this should support faster growth in the long term. </p>
<p>Of course this is a very simple model (it's the starting point for most economists, not the end point). In an open economy, you'd have to think about the impact on the exchange rate, capital flows, global demand. And a prolonged recession can hurt potential output as people lose skills, and the capital stock deteriorates. But distinguishing short-term fluctuations from long-term potential is a good way to start thinking about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You put savings for emergencies and retirements under the same category but they have massively different impact on the economy. When you save money for emergencies you put the money away in a safe savings account where they can be quickly retrieved when needed. This means that the wealth you have created will not be contributing to the economy very much as the bank need to keep the money on hand and not take any risks with them. But it is only recommended that you save about 2-6 months worth of expenses for emergencies which in the grand scheme of things is not that much.</p>
<p>Retirement on the other hand is quite different kind of savings. When you put money in a retirement fund you tell the bank to try to make them grow as much as possible as you do not need any of it until decades later. So the bank will make money the best way they can by investing the money. And since you do not need the money for a long time they can do pretty risky investments at that. This will give the economy a boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's a difference between &quot;saving money&quot; and &quot;putting it under the pillow&quot;. if you put your money under the pillow, you withdraw it from the economic circle. the money lies around and isn't invested in anything. </p>
<p>but if you're saving it in the normal way (i.e. put it in your bank account), it doesn't leave the circle, because the bank now has more deposits that it can use to create new loans that enter the economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wouldn't we see a decline in consumer spending</p>
</blockquote>
<p>considering that the u.s. have been consuming more than they produce since the '70s, that wouldn't be a bad thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If everyone were burying money in little caches out in the woods, yeah. If they were investing it or at least putting it in the bank, not necessarily because then the money would still end up moving around the economy when your bank loaned it out to someone or the sellers of the stocks your mutual fund bought turned around and bought cocaine wirh the money, or whatever the case my be. It would definitely have an effect on the economy because the money would end up being used differently if it ended up in the hands of banks vs retail companies, but I have no idea whether it would be good or bad on balance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
