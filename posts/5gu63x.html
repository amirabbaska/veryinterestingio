		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, this is quite a difficult question. I'll try to give an answer that is not too mathematical (which I tend to do usually). If it's too complicated, I'm sorry. :(</p>
<p>First of all (sort of historically), Planck's constant is the proportionality between light of a specific wavelength (i.e. light of a specific color) and the energy a single light particle (a photon) has. This is already quite a profound statement. Energy is usually measured in Joule, while the frequency is measured in Hertz (= 1 / seconds). That means this proportionality constant has a unit of Joule <em> second. This unit is what physicists call the unit of an </em>action*. For someone who does not care about the mathematics of physics, an action is quite an abstract concept. You could say it is a measure for how much dynamics a system exhibits over a time interval (precisely: It's the integral of the difference between kinetic and potential energies in a system over a time interval). An interesting fact is that your physical reality around is the one that has the minimal action that is possible.</p>
<p>What we can understand from that really, is that Planck's constant can be seen as being related to dynamics of a system. However, it only arises in the case of quantum mechanics. I.e. it is what separates classical physics from quantum mechanics. Planck's constant sort of restricts this action in a sense. While in classical physics the action of a system can take any value whatsoever, in quantum mechanics you are always restricted to multiples of Planck's constant. In this way physicists say that classical physics can sometimes be recovered from quantum mechanics, if we assume Planck's constant to be zero (this is really only a thought experiment, we cannot change Planck's constant of course). </p>
<p>Planck's constant being related to dynamics of a system, it has a say in what kind of positions and momenta (that is velocities) particles in quantum mechanics can be. In fact, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that position and momentum of a particle are related such that one <em>cannot</em> measure both at the same time better than Planck's constant, i.e. the product of the momentum uncertainty and position uncertainty needs to be larger than Planck's constant. This in effect means that if you measure one of the two very well, the other needs becomes more uncertain (as in actually will take values of a larger range). It kind of means if you try to trap a particle in a very small volume, it's uncertainty in velocity and direction will become huge and vice versa, because the product of the two needs to be larger than Planck's constant.</p>
<p>So, in a way one can argue that Planck's constant really is a fundamental unit of our Universe; our Universe is not continuous, but rather grid like on extremely small scales (heck, Planck's constant has a value of 6.63 * 10^(-34) Js, which is so ridiculously small I don't even know how to give a proper example). And the size of these blocks is directly proportional to Planck's constant.</p>
<p>Well, I hope this was somehow understandable or even answers what you want to know. This really is at the core of most of physics, so a proper explanation is always going to be lacking in some respects. If you have more specific questions, just ask. :)</p>
<p>edit: fixed some 'typos'. Accidentally wrote Heisenberg's uncertainty principle means the product of the two needs to be smaller and not larger than Planck's constant (the latter is true).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before Planck, it was thought that energy, frequency, all of those measurements were a smooth continuous spectrum.  You could always add another decimal.  You could emit something at 99.99999 hertz and also at 99.9999999999 hertz, etc.</p>
<p>Planck realized there's a problem here.  He was looking at something called black body radiation, which is basically an object that emits radiation at all frequencies.  But if you allow frequencies to be defined infinitely close to one another, and it emits at &quot;all&quot; frequencies, doesn't that mean it emits an infinite amount of energy?  After all, you could always define another frequency .00000000000000000001 between the last two you defined and say it emits at that too.</p>
<p>Obviously this doesn't happen.  So Planck theorized that there is a minimum &quot;resolution&quot; to frequencies and energy.  Through both experimentation and theory, he realized that all the frequencies and energies radiated were multiples of a single number, which came to be called Planck's constant.  To simplify, you could emit at say, 10000 Planck's constants, and at 10001, but not at 10000.5.</p>
<p>Because energy, frequency, mass, matter, etc. are all related through other theories, this minimum &quot;resolution&quot; to energy has enormous implications to everything in physics.  It's basically the minimum resolution to the whole universe.</p>
<p>Because nothing travels faster than light, and mass and space and time and the speed of light are related, you can derive things from it like Planck Time (the smallest possible measurable time), Planck Length (the smallest possible measurable distance), etc.  In a way, it's basically the constant that defines the size of a &quot;pixel&quot; of reality.</p>
<p>(Edit: a number of people have called out that the quantization does not happen at the frequency level.  This is correct, but given the constant's proportional relationship between the discrete energy level of an oscillator vs. the frequency E=hf I figured I could skip over this and treat the frequency as discrete in the answer and move on.  Remember most of the audience doesn't even know what a photon <em>is</em>.  The tradeoffs over oversimplification for ELI5.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, if you want an explanation for a real five years old let's just put it that way.</p>
<p>Max Planck showed that matter and energy are not continuous, which was an ongoing debate at the time. Planck talks about &quot;quanta&quot;. He proved that the energy of a photon (particule of light) is equal to his frequency multiplied by a constant</p>
<p>E=h*v </p>
<p>E is the energy, h is Planck's Constant and v is the frequency of the photon.</p>
<p>What that means is that a photon cannot take any energy value. It can only take multiples of Planck's Constant. What that means mathematically is that E/v is always a multiple of h.</p>
<p>Let's image it : If the energy is transferred by packages, it can be transferred 1 package at a time, or 2, or 26, but it can't be transferred 3.6 packages at once. In real life, 1 package is equal to h=6,626.10^-34  J.s.</p>
<p>If you wanna know a fun fact, Max Planck was convinced that matter was continuous and he was the one to prove that it, in fact, was not. He was also a non-atomist but when the proof of the existence of the atom emerged (Einstein... U da best) he rallied to the atomist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you know how when you roll the dice in a board game like Life or Sorry!, the smallest amount of spaces you can move is one? Well, let's say it takes one unit of energy for you to move your piece one space, two units of energy to move your piece two spaces, and so on.</p>
<p>Planck's constant is like that, but for the universe. It says that the minimum amount of energy you can expend on (i.e. transfer to) a mass is a number &quot;h&quot;, called Planck's constant.</p>
<p><strong>Example for light:</strong></p>
<p>The energy of a single light wave is equal to Planck's constant multiplied by the frequency of the light (E = hf). Since (1) frequency is the number of times a full period passes by a point in a given time (usually a second), and (2) light in a vacuum always moves at the same speed, c, this means that, given two light waves of the same length, the one with the higher energy will have more waves in it. This obviously means that those waves are going to be closer together, which means that each wave is going to be smaller. Therefore, we can use another measurement -- wavelength (λ) -- which is clearly related to frequency, to talk about light. </p>
<p>You've seen this before without even noticing it. It's the reason we have different colors. Different wavelengths of light stimulate different components in our eyes, and our brain interprets those different stimulations as different colors. I could probably go on forever with this tangent, but hopefully this helps explain why Planck's constant has real, tangible meaning.</p>
<p>Sidenote: the &quot;h&quot; stands for &quot;help&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Added an example and rephrased the second sentence to cover sub-hertz EM waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there's great answers in this thread, I am going to try to merge some of them.</p>
<p>As u/ReshKayden, u/Vindaar and others explained.</p>
<p>Light comes in different frequencies, and though they can interfere they are different sources of energy.</p>
<p>Planck realized that, since many objects release light in a range of frequencies (for example a light bulb) you can filter out all the different frequencies of an object, and extract energy from them, if there are infinite frequencies then there must be infinite energy! This doesn't make sense (last I checked my electric bill my light-bulbs don't consume infinite energy). If there's a limited amount of frequencies though that would mean that we could spread them and there would have to be some &quot;space&quot; between them where a frequency cannot exist. You could think of this smallest difference in frequencies as the resolution, just like in a picture a pixel is the smallest space that can exist between two colors.</p>
<p>Now photons have energy, and the energy they have is the frequency they can have. There's a proportion between the wavelength and the energy which represents the smallest difference we talked about. This is the Planck constant.</p>
<p>Now frequency is measured in how many times something happens, and the energy of a photon is measured in Joules. Because Planck's constant is a proportion we know that <em>E=hv</em> where h is the Planck Constant, E is the energy in Joules, and v is the frequency, so in units <em>J=h/s</em>, this means that the unit the unit of the Planck(<em>h</em>) is Joules * seconds.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Well think of energy as the ability to change. The more energy you have the more you can change. You can use the energy to heat up (or cool down by loosing it), you can use it to move around, to speed up or slow down, to change in color, to grow larger. So think then of the unit of Planks as &quot;changes on time&quot; a better way of thinking of this is &quot;an action&quot;. Since plank is the smallest number of Joules-second we can see in the universe, you can think of it as the smallest amount of action possible (without it being 0 and nothing happening).</p>
<p>Once you are doing the smallest action you can choose to either change something very quickly and a lot, or change something very little but over a long time. That is at some point something has to give.</p>
<p>Now why does this matter? Well the problem relates to how things see each other, and how they can interact. When we want to know how something will be, we need to know to things: how it is right now, and how it is changing (if at all). For example where the thing is, and how fast it's moving (momentum).</p>
<p>Observing something is an action. In order to know where something is you have to observe it very often. Also when you observe it you don't want to change its speed, so you have to change it very little. The thing is that there's a limit to how small this can be, which means that invariably you will affect one.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Imagine that the Planck constant was HUUUGEE, I'm talking about 1J-s (which is a lot of 0s larger than what it actually is). Now imagine that you are in a dark room, there's a fairy floating around the room with you and it's being an asshole. You want to get your revenge by hitting it with some balls you have.</p>
<p>The thing is you can't see the fairy, so you throw the balls around and hit the fairy. Each time you hit it you know where it is. The fairy could turn around between hits, so you have to hit it often to be certain of where the fairy is at any moment. The problem is that the fairy's cannot change its speed, unless it hits something like a wall, or your ball. The stronger it hits something the more it can change its speed. So you need to hit the fairy often, to know where it is, and hit it very weakly so it doesn't change its location.</p>
<p>The problem is that Planck's constant is 1Js in this world and throwing the ball is an action that cannot be smaller than it. If you want to hit the fairy every second you must hit it with at least 1J, which means that it's hard to know where it is, and its hard to know where its going.</p>
<p>If you hit the fairy more often to know where it is better, say every 1/2 second, you would have to throw the ball twice as fast and hit the fairy twice as strong, a 2J. Like we said you can't change something less/slower than the Planck constant. </p>
<p>If you hit the fairy very weakly you'll be able to guess the speed by seeing how much it moves. You won't be able to check on the fairy very often which means you won't get a good idea of where the fairy is at any moment.</p>
<p>Basically observing the fairy is an action, and the energy and frequency of the action affect what you observe. Since Planck's constant defines a smallest ratio between Energy and Frequency of any action, then there's a smallest ratio of what you observe vs. what you don't. The more you know about the fairy's location, the less you know about how fast its moving and where (its momentum), the more you know about where its moving the less you can know about where it is.</p>
<p>This is called the Uncertainty Principle and it is one of the foundations of quantum theory and the universe.</p>
<p>Now why don't we normally observe this? Because the Plank constant is very small. Humans can't do actions that quickly or weakly. Imagine the fairy again, but imagine it was 60,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times heavier or slower (or a mix of both). Suddenly your 1 Joule strong hits would barely move it, and it would be so slow that hitting it every second would be a good reference. This is how things are at the scale we humans see the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
