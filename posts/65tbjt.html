<p>I don't understand how this can happen? If there is a global sea level rise shouldn't everywhere be rising? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring sea level is actually tricky business and we're not really <em>that</em> good at it currently.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's global sea level and local sea level. Global sea level is mostly affected (at least on human time scales) by the volume and temperature of the ocean (which is mostly affected by melting of surface ice). But the land on Earth is not static, so local sea level ends up being even more complicated with a lot more factors going into it. A major factor around river mouths, for example, is subsidence. The land there is soft, and it settles over time (to simplify) so even if nothing about the ocean changed the water depth at a particular point in a river delta might get deeper over time. Similarly, material deposition can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>An important factor today is that the Earth only recently, in geological terms, came out of an ice age. For a period of about a hundred thousand years vast ice sheets covered much of the northern land masses. The current location of Boston would have been under more than a kilometer of ice, for example. Those ice sheets were, of course, massive and the water that made them up came out of the oceans, which is why the sea levels were lower during that period. Additionally, the weight of those ice sheets pushed down the continents, which float on the solid but plastic mantle. When the ice sheets retreated with the end of the ice age about ten thousand years ago the water raised the global sea level significantly (flooding a lot of low lying areas) but it also reduced the force that was weighing down the areas of the continents where the ice sheets were. As a consequence many northern land masses have been experiencing a long period of &quot;post-glacial rebound&quot;, as slow geologic forces push them toward a different equilibrium elevation than when they were weighed down by glaciers.</p>
<p>This movement is actually large enough to be measurable, and it's highest in places like Norway and Northern Canada. And, of course, Alaska. Southern Alaska is rebounding at a rate of several millimeters per year. Global sea level rise is smaller than this movement so local sea level change in regions still experiencing post-glacial rebound is negative, the sea seems to be going down (though in fact the land is going up). You can see the same thing in <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=040-321" target="_blank">Oslo, Norway</a> for example.</p>
<p>But if you look at areas that never had local glaciation and aren't experiencing post-glacial rebound, like <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.htm?stnid=500-041" target="_blank">Mumbai, India</a>, you see a different trend, one of increasing sea level. However, if you look at the sea level trends for a lot of different port cities at low latitudes you'll find that the rates of sea level increase are all over the place, from just a single mm/year up to several mm/year. A lot of that is due to different rates of subsidence. The land moves (both up and down), so trying to measure one moving thing from another moving thing is a very challenging problem.</p>
<p>We've been measuring the sea level with satellites for decades, but even that is not without it's fair share of problems. The main one being that we can't seem to calibrate the measurements of the satellites sufficiently well to actually have much confidence in the exact values of the trend data. We can be fairly certain that there's a global sea level rise but it may be as low as 0.5 mm/year or as high as 2-3 mm/year, it's hard to be certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A process called isostatic rebound causes land uplift resulting from the lack of ice that was once present which caused large depressions over an area. This uplift, or rebound, is greater then the rate of sea level rise. A classic example of this process can be observed in north eastern Europe, where historically the land was covered in ice kilometres in thickness, similar to present day Greenland. It is very important to note that sea level change is a very complex science with dozens of factors contributing to a net rise or fall for example, water temperature, air pressure, and water currents trends. All of which change on annual, decadal, centennial, and millennial scales. The max and min sea level difference globally is a much as 70m from what I remember, all due to local factors mentioned. </p>
