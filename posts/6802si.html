<p>Physostigmine causes dangerously high levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Atropine prevents cells from sensing acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Atropine is actually used as an antidote for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (like physostigmine and sarin), but it is poisonous in its own right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this explicitly answers your question, but the first thing that comes to mind is ethylene glycol (the main component of antifreeze) and high doses of alcohol. ethylene glycol can be fatal because, when it gets broken down by alcohol dehydrogenase, it results in serious organ damage. alcohol when taken in excess is fatal, but is actually one of the antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning because it has a higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase than ethylene glycol. giving a person enough ethanol to make them severely intoxicated will save them from ethylene glycol poisoning because it prevents the ethylene glycol from being broken down into its more toxic components. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you consider to be a poison or toxin. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are both things you wouldn't want to ingest by themselves, but mix them in just the right quantities and you get salt water. Reactions like this are called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_21c/chemical_synthesis/whychemicalsrev10.shtml" target="_blank">neutralization reactions</a>.</p>
<p>That said, <strong>do not try this</strong>, as even a small imbalance will leave behind enough of one or the other to give you serious chemical burns. For an example, look at the titration curve in the linked example. It swings very suddenly from being a very strong acid to a very strong base -- you would have to be extremely lucky to get anything near neutral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a poison, and so is the active ingredient in antifreeze ethylene glycol. When someone tries to kill themselves by drinking antifreeze the treatment is an ethyl alcohol iv drip. One troubled soul in college wanted to kill himself by drinking antifreeze, to make it more palatable he mixed it with vodka, inadvertently saving his life. He did pass out, but when he was found, after an iv drip he was fine with no kidney damage. </p>
<p>Tragically a year or two later he shot himself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
