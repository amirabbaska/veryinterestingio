		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Aerospace Engineer here who works Guidance, Navigation, and Control on interplanetary rocket launches for a living. While there can be some corrections performed en route once launched, they are minor and mostly for correcting very minor dispersions. </p>
<p>Interplanetary missions have either instantaneous launch windows once or twice a day, or short windows (nearly always less than 2 hours) once a day. Those short windows shift by a few minutes each day to account for the rotation of the Earth, the movement of Earth in its orbit, and the movement of other planets in their orbits. Launch Vehicles with RAAN correction can help lengthen the launch window, as can the type of trajectory and type of mission (is it slamming into Mars with a balloon or parachute, is it doing a precise aerobraking maneuver, or is it doing a series of gravity assists on multiple planets).</p>
<p>For instance, Delta II Mars missions had instantaneous windows since the Guidance system of the Delta II couldn't correct for plane changes due to launching late. Most Atlas V launches to interplanetary targets had longer windows (still less than 2 hours), since it has a more advanced Guidance system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When setting up for gravity assists, you usually have quite a long trip ahead of you before you even reach the object that is supposed to assist you. That allows for a lot of corrections to be made to the trajectory before you get to the place of intersection. A few hours off would be rather easy to catch up if your destination isn't to be reached until half a year or more later.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist#/media/File:Cassini_interplanet_trajectory.svg" target="_blank">this image of the trajectory of Cassini</a> you can see that the launch is 6 months prior to the first assist maneuver (Venus 1 flyby). With some extra fuel included in the launch for corrections, something that is always carried to some extent for longer missions, you get some leeway with regards to the launch time. I will leave it up to someone with more knowledge on the subject to give a realistic window for launches, though.</p>
<p>A graph that shows the Cassini probe's speed relative to the sun can be seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist#/media/File:Cassini%27s_speed_related_to_Sun.png" target="_blank">here</a>, if that is of interest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hardest part isn't so much correcting the time shift, which is relatively easy, but in correcting the change in rotational velocity offset by the Earth. The Earth is moving about 460m/s at the equator. If you launch at the perfect time, all of that speed should go with you in your launch. If you wait, you won't be pointed in the right direction to take advantage of that speed, and thus will end up in a less than optimal orbit. Also essential is leaving the Earth's orbit going the right direction, which can also save a significant delta-v.</p>
<p>This is the reason why typical interplanetary missions have an orbital launch window of only a few minutes per day, but have one every day. Launching a day late does change the slingshot parameter path, but launching at the wrong time of the day does far more than that. That launch window doesn't much care if one is going directly to Mars, or a flyby of Mars somewhere else, for instance, as the trajectory to do the slingshot can be adjusted closer to the target of interest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most interplanetary launches have some built in hold time.  It can be as short as 5 minutes, or as long as 240 minutes depending on vehicle type, and any kind of drain back issues for lox propellants.  As a rule of thumb,  the daily launch windows are large for anything outside earth's SOI, but then you become limited with planetary alignments.  Even these usually give a cushion of up too two weeks as we try to be green on the first day, first window.
