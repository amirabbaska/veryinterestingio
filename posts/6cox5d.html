		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children are predisposed to prefer sweet, as it indicates sugar and therefore high energy to volume ratio. As we get older, we lose some of this drive for fast, powerful energy sources.  We can tolerate more complex flavors, especially bitter like coffee or alcohol. </p>
<p>Personally, I think it also has to do with suffering hardship. A child may expend a lot of energy running around, but it is nothing like working a long day, sweating and hating the experience, and being acutely aware that putting yourself through such torture is necessary to not starve to death. A cold, bitter drink is refreshing in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Edit- Jesus, this one got popular. </p>
<p>1- I do not have a background in science, but my first statement is from memory on child psychology and anatomy/physiology courses in school. I was an art major and excellent at selecting classes that dropped my GPA while providing very little to my actual skill set. </p>
<p>2- It has been mentioned below that children also love sour- I think it's the same reason- in nature, sour tends to be fruit, and fruit tends to have sugar and vitamins children crave. </p>
<p>3- It has also been mentioned that bitter usually means poison in nature, and children tend to experience it more intensely to dissuade eating poison.</p>
<p>4- I am not depressed, but I have been. I have been over educated and working in some deep hell pits. Double edit- this is not to brag. I have a degree. I have also worked in a place where my coworkers literally could not spell their two-letter gang sign. It was grim. I know that there are many in worse positions, and that made it worse to feel like a egotistical wuss FOR feeling that way on top of feeling that way. However, in that situation, cold bitter drinks helped &quot;shock&quot; the system, embracing the bitter and embracing my situation and being able to calm down. </p>
<p>5- Some kids do manual labor. Some kids have a shitty lot. They don't like beer either. However, I don't think most children have the faculties to understand the gravity of many situations. Humans tend to have difficulty thinking to the future until their mid 20's. It's not just the labor itself, it's the &quot;oh my god, I might be doing this for the rest of my life. I might die here. I might never get to fulfill the dreams I have&quot; kind of thoughts that   struggling adults have and children don't.</p>
<p>Final edit- this was not intended to be an all-inclusive answer. I don't think hardship is the ONLY reason to enjoy beer or other bitter drinks, but I do believe it is a factor. As mentioned, we have the physiological change to tastebuds, social pressure and the chemical aspect of alcohol as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taste/smell are substantially about figuring out whether food and drink are good and full of energy, or bad and poisonous. From birth, sweet=calories=good, but infants in their first few months are pretty open to any flavor. Soon enough, though, they become more cautious, especially disliking bitter flavors. This persists for a long time, and varies genetically a bit, but sensitivity to bitterness seems to decrease in adulthood.</p>
<p>Repeated exposure helps a lot. If it hasn't caused nausea or death after a few times, it's probably not poison. Initially, beer tastes bitter and alcoholic. With repeated consumption, both the alcohol and bitter hops become less prominent, while more pleasing sensations like yeast, sweet malt, or hop aroma become more apparent.</p>
<p>Finally, there's probably some conditioning taking place. The first time one drinks beer, it tastes unpleasant. If one keeps drinking, however, it becomes associated with hydration, nutrition, and intoxication. A similar process may lead to coffee, initially quite strong and bitter-tasting, becoming associated with mild stimulation and therefore more pleasant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B.A. in psychology with a study in neuroscience </p>
<p>Here is an official scientific explanation, keeping it simple:</p>
<p>The taste of beer is not the only taste that becomes more enjoyable with growth. First of all, the gustatory cells that make up the tongue regenerate at a noticeably reduced rate in comparison to superficial damage to our epithelial skin. Thus, damage to the tongue can last a long time and has a good chance of being permanent. An example of someone who lost their taste as a result of cancer to the tongue is the famous cook Grant Achatz. If you look into his story, you will see he regained his taste, but it only came back after months.</p>
<p>Now, with that in mind, consider the presence of taste receptors on the tongue. The distribution for every human being is going to be unique, but a common factor among children is that they have a larger amount of taste receptors that have been exposed to fewer toxins or damage. As a result, they can taste more intensely, and thus prefer sweets to bitterness. </p>
<p>So why do old people acquire a taste for beer? There's an old Slavic joke - Why does Vodka taste better the more you drink it? Because it burns your taste buds off. Joke aside, that is indeed what can happen. As we age, our taste receptors work less well and we taste certain flavors, such as bitterness, with reduced sensitivity. Of course, these changes are not generalized and there are many outliers, which is why some individuals may never acquire a taste for beer. Keep in mind though that taste is never pure and is always a complex sensation of mixed taste receptors being activated.</p>
<p>So, as we age, our tongue receptors change, and the way they change results in less sensitivity to bitterness, which enables us to appreciate the complexity in the flavors of beers more than being overloaded with the initial bitter taste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically your taste buds, especially the ones which taste bitterness become less effective as you age. You can taste less and less of the bitterness of beer as you age. This is also the same reason that adults like the taste of brussel sprouts and broccoli while kids hate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't like it; it is an acquired taste.  Just like I didn't like spinach when I was little, through repeated exposure you learn that its flavor is what it is supposed to taste like, and it stops tasting weird.</p>
<p>Having said that, I'm 53; I don't like beer. When I was in college and all my friends were drinking beer, I tried it too. The first few sips were OK, but then the taste was unpleasant and the only way to finish a bottle was through willpower.</p>
<p>I realized that if I stuck with it and kept trying it over and over, I'd be likely to acquire a taste for it. But why?  It has a large number of low quality calories, costs significant money, inhibits what activities I can do after drinking, and consuming it causes health risks.</p>
<p>I was never a joiner so it didn't bother me go my own way, and I had cool friends who never pressured me into drinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
