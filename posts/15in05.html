If you blind folded me, and went through asking me did I own book X, I could tell you with 95-100% accuracy. You could even fake books, or ask me about books I don't own, I'd be able to tell you yes or no. However, if you asked me to list all my books and write it on a piece of paper, I'd be lucky to get 25% of them before running out of steam. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when prompted with the book name, I could tell you the general plot of the book, list characters, describe the physical book, and maybe even when and where I got it. </p>
<p>Why is this information only accessible one way, and not another? For lack of a better description, why can't my brain search by &quot;Books owned&quot; tag and return a list? The information is clearly there! </p>
<p>I stumbled on this strangeness when someone asked me to list all 50 states. I could get about 75% of them before I started repeating, and only when I sketched a map was I able to fill in the rest. But when I had a map I could easily label every state. </p>
<p>Edit: I don't know which category tag to use for this, Neuroscience, or Psychology?</p></div></div>

<li><strong>&quot;Why can't my brain search by &quot;Books owned&quot; tag and return a list? The information is clearly there!&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario involves a situation where memory has been successfully encoded and stored, but cannot be retrieved. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forgetting can be caused by the <strong>blocking</strong> of a memory representation, that is, by obstruction that can occur when multiple associations are associated with a cue and one of those associations is stronger than the others, preventing retrieval of the target information. Many theorists believe that the probability of retrieving a target memory depends on the strength of the association between the retrieval cue and the target representation relative to the strength of the association between that same cue and other representations. In the ensuing competition during retrieval, the representation with the strongest association “wins” and is remembered; ones with weaker associations “lose” and are “forgotten”. There is an important contrast here to decay theories, which hold that the degraded memory representation is lost; blocking theory emphasizes that the forgotten information still resides in memory, but access to it is temporarily blocked by a dominant competing representation. This weaker representation can be unblocked if a better retrieval cue, one that is more strongly associated with it, is presented.</p>
<p>Blocking likely accounts for many instances of forgetting; the mental representation of the old password, unused for some time, could be considered a weaker representation than the new password, which is used daily (Figure 5–16). The phenomenon is possibly adaptive: it permits the updating of memories so that we remember the information most likely to be relevant (Bjork, 1989). <strong>Blocking also partly explains a striking and counterintuitive characteristic of memory: that the mere act of remembering one stimulus or event can result in the forgetting of another.</strong> Suppose you idly start thinking about cataloguing your CDs, and you begin by making a mental list of them. The list grows quickly at first, but very soon your rate of retrieval slows. Your familiarity with all your CDs is about the same, so why should this be? What is happening is a phenomenon called output interference, in which the strengthening of memories provided by the act of initial retrieval blocks the retrieval of other memories. Retrieving the names of some of the CDs in your collection serves to strengthen the association between those representations and the retrieval cue; and in turn these newly strengthened representations serve to block access to other CD titles, temporarily decreasing your ability to remember them. (<a href="http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~ashas/Cognition%20Textbook/chapter5.pdf" target="_blank">link to source -- pg 227</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your case, &quot;Books owned&quot; is the cue, and each of the books on your shelf is an association of that cue. By initially starting your list (for example: &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;) you strengthen the mental link between &quot;Books owned&quot; and those associations. As this happens though, you weaken the mental link between &quot;Books owned&quot; and other titles like &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;.</p>
<p>Using variations of the original cue (e.g. &quot;Books I own that I read for high school&quot;, &quot;Books I own that are non-fiction&quot;, &quot;Books I own that are paperbacks&quot;) might help you make a more substantial list because there are less competing associations as each cue becomes more specific.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Why is this information only accessible one way, and not another?&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The two different types of ways you are describing are &quot;free recall&quot; (remembering all of the books on your shelf), and &quot;recognition&quot; (remembering a specific title when asked about it). In general it is easier to perform recognition (<em>&quot;Do you own the Lord of the Rings books?&quot;</em>) because that cue has a single, strong association, whereas in the free recall (<em>&quot;What books do you own?&quot;</em>) there are multiple associations and hence blocking becomes a factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a phenomenon called priming. Without a stimulus related to a book (like the name), you'll probably only going to remember the most accessed books or most recently used books on your shelf. However, if someone says the name for you, the likelihood that you will remember owning/not-owning the book correctly will go up because you had to think about the book seconds before answering the question. For more information, look at the book Human Associative Memory (Anderson, J. R., &amp; Bower, G. H. (1973). Human associative memory. Washington, DC: Winston and Sons)</p>
<p>EDIT: several people have pointed out that &quot;priming&quot; is a loaded term in cognitive psychology research. When I talk about it in this post, I use it loosely, and not in the narrow sense of unconscious priming. Interesting discussion of the differences can be found in several child posts, such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15in05/why_cant_i_list_every_book_i_know_but_i_can_tell/c7mx6jj" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some theorists believe two processes work in memory: (1) familiarity and (2) recollection (e.g., Jacoby, 1991). (This is similar to Kahneman's &quot;thinking fast vs. slow&quot; work.) Familiarity is fast process that's evoked from perceptual (or conceptual) features of the stimulus. When familiarity is used, something &quot;seems&quot; familiar, or you can tell that you &quot;know&quot; it (or in this case, have it).</p>
<p>Recollection, in contrast, is associated with specific episodic and contextual cues associated with the encoding event. To engage in recollection, you mentally travel back in time to the episode in which learning occurred to retrieve the memory.</p>
<p>Thus, when I ask you to name the books you have in your library (i.e., free recall), I'm requiring you to engage in recollection -- to travel back in time to when you obtained those books, the last time you saw them on your shelf, etc. to make the retrieval.</p>
<p>When I ask you if you recognize certain books, though, not only can you make use of recollective detail, but familiarity is also brought to bear. Things can seem familiar and you can answer based on that information, too. The downside, though, is that familiarity is much more likely to be faulty. Although you feel you'd be more accurate on this test of recognition vs. recall, I bet that you'd be more likely to make more true and false positives on the recognition test.</p>
<p>This is how cognitive psychology or cognitive science would answer this question. Let me know if I can be more specific or offer more references.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
