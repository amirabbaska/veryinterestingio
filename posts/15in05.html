		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Example: I have huge bookshelves full of books. If you blind folded me, and went through asking me did I own book X, I could tell you with 95-100% accuracy. You could even fake books, or ask me about books I don't own, I'd be able to tell you yes or no. However, if you asked me to list all my books and write it on a piece of paper, I'd be lucky to get 25% of them before running out of steam. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when prompted with the book name, I could tell you the general plot of the book, list characters, describe the physical book, and maybe even when and where I got it. </p>
<p>Why is this information only accessible one way, and not another? For lack of a better description, why can't my brain search by &quot;Books owned&quot; tag and return a list? The information is clearly there! </p>
<p>I stumbled on this strangeness when someone asked me to list all 50 states. I could get about 75% of them before I started repeating, and only when I sketched a map was I able to fill in the rest. But when I had a map I could easily label every state. </p>
<p>Edit: I don't know which category tag to use for this, Neuroscience, or Psychology?</p></div></div>
