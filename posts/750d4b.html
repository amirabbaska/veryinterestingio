		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of cynical answers here about decorative gardens bring a status symbol/ people confirming to the standards of society. However, I think the answer is much simpler than that: people like flowers and decorative plants. I like looking at the front of my home and thinking, &quot;Wow, this looks just like I always imagined it.&quot; I don't think of how others will view the house -- I'm just glad that the work I put into the garden paid off for me.</p>
<p>Also, vegetables are readily available at the store. You can save a little money by planting your item vegetables, but what if you still want flowers? Potted flowers are harder to take care of (in my opinion, at least), and if you don't like the look of them in a pot you're out of luck. </p>
<p>People are entitled to do to their yards what will make them happy. We don't have to conform to the most efficient standard, and doing what's economically a little beneficial does not mean you're doing what's most mentally beneficial. If you want to plant a vegetable garden in your front lawn, you're free to do so (so long as you're not breaking any laws). Other people do not have to justify to you their difference of opinion on how they should utilize their yard.</p>
<p>Edit: I definitely misread the question as having an angrier tone than it really does. I apologize for the angry tone of my response to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in USA without an HOA. There vast majority have their fruit/veggies in the backyard, though some in my neighborhood have a couple veggies up front. I think it has more to do with fencing in the backyard that can protect the garden from pests. Fencing in the front yard is more restrictive per ordinance as opposed to the backyard. You have to have some protection from squirrels, rabbits and raccoons here or they'll destroy. </p>
<p>Most people have a water spigot in the back, not necessarily the front.</p>
<p>Old people in my neighborhood have been known to steal a couple flowers out of people's front yard, I'd assume they could sneak a couple tomatoes if you had it out front.</p>
<p>Most houses have more open land in the back as opposed to the front as utilities come in from the street. Don't want to put your garden down where the gas line comes in.</p>
<p>Also, for re-sale, most people want a clean &quot;curbside appeal&quot; photo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with what others are saying about HOA rules... Fruits and vegetables require a great deal of maintenance and don't really help as much as you would think.</p>
<p>We grow tomatoes and peppers and use them in salsas and things. It doesn't really save us that much money, we do it because we enjoy it. But it does attract rabbits and groundhogs, as well as insects. You have to weed regularly, and you have to gather up any fruit and vegetables that drop on the ground (unless you don't mind having even more bugs and rodents).</p>
<p>So in short... high labor, not as much savings as you would imagine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two thoughts:
A lot of people just can't be bothered growing vegetables - they don't look pretty, they take a lot of work and it is much easier just buying food from a supermarket.</p>
<p>The front garden and facade of your house is your 'advert' to everyone walking past - to have a nice garden of flowers without any real practical need is a display that you are affluent enough to afford to grow plants, and are willing to spend the money/effort to care for them.</p>
<p>Crop plants, being typically less pretty, and requiring more 'ugly' help like protective netting to prevent animals just don't work as a display piece, so are often hidden around the back where they can be tended to in peace without worrying that you have left a bundle of canes and a wheelbarrow laying out...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most veggies are delicious to the deer and rabbits in my neighborhood, so they're planted out back behind a fence where my dogs sometimes hang out.</p>
<p>Few vegetables look good year-round. My shrubs and perennials do. </p>
<p>Sometimes you have to cover your vegetables - early spring for warmth, occasionally in the summer if you're getting three or four days of heavy storms - and nobody wants a sea of plastic sheeting in their front yard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
