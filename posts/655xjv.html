		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a space ship and alcohol as a solar storm the ship has to travel through. </p>
<p>As the solar storm intensifies (more alcohol), the ship has to divert power from other components to maintain power on the shield and protect the ship. One of the first changes is that the AI autopilot (smart decision making) gets switched to a basic manual controls (impaired judgement). </p>
<p>As the storm intensifies, the captain decides to disable the flight recorder logs to save power. This means that the current flight data (short term memory) is not stored to the archives (long term memory).</p>
<p>This is what happens when we drink too much alcohol. It's not that we lost memories but the alcohol prevents us from recording them in the first place. Low to medium amounts may result in patches of time when memory is not recorded but heavy drinking can result in whole sections of time where you have no memory of what occurred. Alcohol does not erase memories as you generally remember all the events that occurred before you started drinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol affects a specific receptor in the brain that is responsible for memory formation. When you drink too much, this receptor is unable to work properly and you &quot;black out&quot; because you're brain isn't capable of creating new memories (which is an interesting distinction from creating the memories and later forgetting them).</p>
<p>If you want a slightly less ELI5 answer, in order to create a memory, the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus must be activated. This is accomplished by the presence of the neurotransmitter glutamate coincided with depolarization of the neuron (which itself is usually caused by activation of AMPA receptors which causes flow of sodium ions into the neuron). Activation of the NMDA receptor allows calcium to flow into the neuron, which causes vesicles that contain AMPA receptors to bind to the neuron's outer membrane. This increase in AMPA receptors on the neuron's surface is known as short-term potentiation and is the first step in long-term potentiation (which usually involves neurons creating new connections with one another). Long-term potentiation is what allows us to store memories. Alcohol, however, inhibits the NMDA receptor. In the presence of alcohol calcium cannot enter the neuron and, as such, new memories cannot be formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple explanation is that your brain does form memories while drunk, but that they don't make sense once sober. You might recall some stuff but it seems more like a dream than real, which is why you might ask friends &quot;Did I really...&quot;</p>
<p>Memories are formed in the brain by neurons making new connections. A theory is that alcohol effects how the neurons form connections such that without alcohol the neurons don't connect.</p>
<p>There is a field of study called State-dependent memory. The basic idea is that if you get drunk, when you are sober you won't really remember what happened. But if you get drunk again you will be able to remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
