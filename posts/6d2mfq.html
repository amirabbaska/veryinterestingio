		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Customers need to have proof of loss to file a damages lawsuit. Most customers had their credit cards replaced by their banks and fraudulent charges reimbursed.</p>
<p>The banks went after Target and got some of their money back while insurers took out the rest.</p>
<p>What's left is the punitive damages for the negligence with personal credit data. Those fines are up to governments to levy. It's designed this way so companies like Target invest in data protection. If there were no fines, they would just save the money and leave your data unprotected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons: </p>
<p>They failed to implement a rule or law that has a penalty.</p>
<p>The State (via police and other gov't agencies) had to commit time to help people and 'clean up the mess'.</p>
<p>Sometimes its just simply hush money... agree to pay the State so they don't look to hard at the inner workings of how the breach occurred.</p>
<p>I work at a Fortune 50 retailer and while on paper we are PCI compliant, I know that we do things that the processors say were not supposed to.. like keep CC numbers and CVS codes.  While there are some gray areas CC numbers can be stored but must be encrypted.  Well, if every CC en encrypted with the same key or hash its significantly less secure than a unique key for each card.  So while we follow the letter of the rules we really don't do it the right or best way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This settlement sounds like it's for fines relating to Target's breach state consumer protection laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should these states receive funds as opposed to the customers whose credit information was compromised?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who says the customers are being iced out? Individual consumers' cases are pending against Target right now. There's a $10M consumer class-action lawsuit still ongoing. It says so right there in the article.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on who brings the lawsuits. It is entirely possible that there are separate suits being brought by individuals. It is also possible that laws in these states allow the state to sue directly rather than people for various reasons (maybe the individual harms are too small to justify individuals suing, or false suits were seen as too common).  You'd need the actual deal/decision/initial filing to know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
