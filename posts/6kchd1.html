		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meals heavy in carbohydrates can cause an immediate blood sugar spike then an insulin response that then leads to a blood sugar crash that can impact wakefulness. If this is severe in individuals this can also be a sign of diabetes. </p>

<p>However, this doesn't mean that everyone that gets tired after a big meal is a diabetic.</p>
<p>EDIT: In addition I should also mention that glucose is the main fuel the brain uses so this is why wakefulness can correlate to blood sugar levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you eat a large meal you activate your parasympathetic nervous system. This is a division of the autonomic nervous system whose function is often described as &quot;rest and digest&quot;. When the parasympathetic nervous system exerts influence over the body we enter a restful state. So, you get sleepy. In contrast the sympathetic nervous system governs the flight or fight response, which controls more active functions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is good at doing a few things. Digesting food, thinking, and doing physical work. However, it is not very good at doing any two of these things at the same time, because each one requires a large amount of energy and oxygen (both provided by blood flow).</p>
<p>After a large meal, most of your blood is diverted to your digestive system to break down all the food you've just shoved in your face. This means that blood is diverted AWAY FROM your brain, making you sleepy.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that thinking doesn't require much energy (after all, it is small and makes up for only 2-3% of your body's total mass), but in general, your brain accounts for about 20% of your caloric output. Your brain not only performs logical reasoning, but also controls your muscles (including involuntary ones like your respiratory and digestive systems).</p>
<p>This is also the reason why we are prone to cramps when we exercise after a medium to large meal. Our bodies simply don't have to capacity to digest food and do physical work at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my college human biology class our professor made an anecdote about how we should all eat before his class(evening class) because our bodies digest food better in a resting(non sleep) state. Since we would all be sitting around for an hour and a half doing nothing and it would be optimal digestive evirnment.</p>
<p>Our body cannot &quot;tell&quot; us to go rest after eating so it sends the signal of being tired to elicit that response from us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Big meals usually contain a lot of carbs (sugar and starch) as well as fat.  When we eat carbs + fat together, it triggers the release of serotonin in our brains which makes us feel happy (think of &quot;comfort foods&quot; like ice cream or macaroni and cheese) and a large surge of serotonin can also make us feel sleepy.  </p>
<p>Also, large meals tend to drive blood glucose levels high, especially if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic. High blood sugar can make you as sleepy/tired as low blood sugar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
