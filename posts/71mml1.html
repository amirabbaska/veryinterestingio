		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People, like strawberries, are huge and soggy and fragile. If we try and freeze them, the water inside starts growing bigger, which pops loads of the little balloons that we huge things are made of. Some of those little balloons are really important, and if too many of them break, the strawberries turns into mush.</p>
<p>Tiny things like human sperm and eggs don't have much water in them, and they are small enough that we can freeze the whole thing at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife is an Embryologist, so I've picked up quite a few things about this.</p>
<p>The problem - frozen water is larger than unfrozen water.  Ice crystals 'pop' the cell when they're created, which then results in the cell being ruined when it's unfrozen.</p>
<p>The technology that is used to freeze sperm and eggs is called 'vitrification'.  This is a combination of things - first off, a partial dehydration of the cell, which removes some of the liquid.  Secondly, an ultra-fast freezing to very low sub-zero temperatures, which changes the form of the ice without causing crystallization - resulting in a much higher survivability.  Modern vitrification techniques have a greater-than 90% survivability rate, often into the 95% rates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this works on a cell-by-cell basis because you can dip the cell in the dehydration medium, and then rapidly freeze it by direct contact with liquid nitrogen at lower than -190Â°C.  It wouldn't work for a full human, because you cannot dehydrate all cells at once, and even if you dipped a human into liquid nitrogen, the time it would take to freeze the whole body would be on the matter of minutes (I'm guessing, but at least seconds), which would cause ice crystals to form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sperm/egg is a single cell: to keep it in stasis, it basically just has to stay still and not fall apart.  Freezing can do that.</p>
<p>A living creature, much less a person, is bajillions of cells, all in the middle of doing things, and a complex electro-chemical nervous system.  <em>That</em> can't just be stopped by freezing it.  You can't freeze the electrical impulses going around, and brains don't just start working again when they've been stopped like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Egg = single cell form of life</p>
<p>Human = Super complicated living structure.</p>
<p>That's the difference when it comes to freezing.  If you kill 10% of the sperm cells in a sample, you still have plenty to get the job done.  If oyu kill 10% of the cells in a person, there is no repairing that complexity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like why a single brick will probably survive a big hurricane but a big building will not. Eggs and sperm are single cells, and cells are the building blocks of all living beings. So single cells are more resistant to environmental stress like super low temperature as compared to a giant, complex design of billions and billions of cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
