There was a time when parents considered reading to be a degenerate activity and that it would lead to all sorts of physical and behavioral issues.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I migrated to US when I was starting high school, and if it wasn't for playing video games in English when I was younger, I would have entered US with very limited vocabulary. It's amazing how many words you can learn from playing a game in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Sure, my mother would have preferred me to read books over video games, but how else are you going to keep a kid entertained while learning English?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watching television at least is largely mindless; you burn more calories <a href="http://www.news.dm/did-you-know-you-burn-more-calories-sleeping-than-you-do-watching-television/" target="_blank">while asleep.</a> Quiz shows such as <em>Jeopardy</em> (in the US) provide something for the brain to do, but shows like those with the Kardashians or other reality TV  really don't do as much. Better to exercise while you watch such a show.</p>
<p>Video games provide good stimulation for the brain, strengthening skills such as creative thinking and teamwork, and before they came along activities such as reading and knitting were the best we had for strengthening creativity and imagination. People who say they don't probably just don't get it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your hobby doesn’t involve exercise, it should be something that engages your brain and forces you to learn or to think critically or creatively.</p>
<p>Most television does none of the above.</p>
<p>A good hobby will involve you accomplishing or creating something, or bettering yourself.</p>
<p>Watching documentaries is a good hobby. Watching reality TV is not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Far as television is concerned, it’s because it’s considered a largely passive, low-engagement activity. Whereas reading is just the opposite. You use more of your mental faculties when reading. </p>
<p>I’m not sure about gaming. I suppose it depends on the game you’re playing. Chess is considered a high-engagement game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
