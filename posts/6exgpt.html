		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The great red spot has been a standout feature of Jupiter for at least a couple hundred years, possibly a lot longer. Clearly it's not a short-lived feature like storms and hurricanes on Earth.</p>
<p>But as for its evolution and the formation of other storms like it, that's all unknown AFAIK. Understanding our own atmosphere is hard enough, understanding Jupiter's very different atmosphere (with much more limited data) is very difficult.</p>
<p>In recent years, the spot <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140515103658.htm" target="_blank">has been shrinking</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Juno probe is contributing data that will hopefully answer some of these questions - or at least get us closer to understanding how Jupiter's atmospheric system works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6o9FiTf1vZE" target="_blank">This very recent video</a> outlines some of the latest discoveries from the probe - including the observation of many cyclone systems at the poles - which were not expected.</p>
<p>If anything, this science poses more questions than it answers, however. Jupiter's atmosphere was assumed to be reasonably uniform; we now know that is not the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read in a book on chaos theory that Philip Marcus was able to simulate it in a computer and said it never went away. It was along the lines in his simulation, Jupiter's rotation creates a very strong coriolis force that made a similar undying spot even though everything else around it was changing. I can't find the text in the book but I found an interview with him talking about the topic

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know how the Great Red Spot formed in the first place, so we can't tell whether another will form, or not, or even how long the current one will last.  We don't know if there is some resonant effect in the atmosphere causing it, or if something massive crashed into the planet long ago, and the Spot is an aftershock.  All we can do is watch it happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
