		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria living in the soil and on surfaces such as pavement and vegetation react with the water and produce that distinct odor. The scent is more pronounced when there is a longer duration between rain events and is scientifically referred to as 'petrichor'. You may smell it before a rainstorm because winds transport the smell over large distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smell is called petrichor, and it's the result of a reaction between a compound called geosmin in soils and other natural surfaces when they come into contact with water after being dry for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the human nose is extremely sensitive to geosmin and can detect a concentration as low as five parts per trillion. It's been suggested that humanity evolved to detect that scent because it tended to guide us towards fresh pastures and food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why people are suggesting petrichor when the rain hasn’t landed yet and couldn’t have reacted with the bacteria in the soil (unless you ment <em>after</em> the storm).</p>
<p>I believe the scent is Ozone, which gets pushed down by the storms downdraft. Apparently I have a sensitive nose because most people I know can’t smell it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ozone is the smell you get right before a storm hits. It's caused by ozone being blown down from the stratosphere by a low pressure system.</p>
<p>Petrichor is the smell you get after or during a rainstorm. It's caused by moisture coming into contact with geosmin in the soil.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard forever ago from a teacher that there wasn’t a smell at all, but rather, the moisture in the air just amplifies your sense of smell. She said that it was basically just becoming aware of all the smells that you weren’t able to pick up before. I guess that wasn’t correct. Or maybe it’s a little bit of both? Either way, I learned something today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
