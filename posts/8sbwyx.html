		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ticks do not show a preference. Their spatial distribution is clustered - the female explodes out her larvae into a small space and they do not travel unless hooked on a food source - their movement is only up and down the leaf litter. Most likely you walked through a patch of larvae and your friends have picked up the odd nymph which are more dispersed as they have travelled on a host. </p>

Both ticks and mosquitoes tend to target people by detecting the CO2 they release from their bodies, so perhaps your metabolic rate is higher than average and produces more carbon dioxide. Blood type O is preferred over A and B for them as well. Additionally, it could be that you were walking in front of them and picking up more because you were leading the trail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, there's a few factors that increase mosquito attractiveness, including genetics, exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However there may be other factors to consider. For example, it's normal for some mice to have many more ticks than other mice, but this is generally attributed to the infested mice having travelled further and so encountering more ticks (which seems like an unlikely explanation for you and your friends on the same trail). Ticks are not terribly mobile compared to mosquitoes, so I'd suspect that if you're picking up more ticks than your friends, it may just be that you're walking in a manner that facilitates them, or maybe your clothes are easier to latch onto.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
