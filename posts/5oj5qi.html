The 60 and 70 are just as far apart as the 100 and 130. Why does the dial need to travel just as far to span 100 kHz as it does to span 300 kHz in a different part? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's not logarithmic, it's closer to a 1/x relation since what you turn is not a resistor, but a variable capacitor. A capacitor and an inductor are used in the tunning circuit attached to the antenna. But log scales are indeed used in frequency plots since it better represents the behavior of systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Behind the dial is a resister that connects between where the needle is and the input antenna. A resister coil adds resistance in a linear state, in order to have the printed scale show what frequency matches for the adjusted antenna length, the scale is printed in a logarithmic scale.  </p>
<p>Most phenomenon involving waves (sound, light, earthquakes, etc.) work in a logarithmic progression. A simple explanation is that for every 10x increase in a log scale, you always move a specific distance on a linear one. The actual scaling can be any number, but 10 is easy to demonstrate.  </p>
<p>So to go from 10 to 100 takes 1 inch on the scale.
Going from 100 to 1 000 takes another inch<br />
1 000 to 10 000 takes another inch</p>
<p>The measure of distance would be from 1 to the number measured. The dial scale does not go down to 1 so you do not see the actual progression from the beginning.  </p>
<p>Edit: changed description of linear motion from multiplier to step size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's got to do mostly with the physics of how the tuner works. Most old school tuning knobs adjust a capacitor or resistor (electrical components) in order to change the frequency that your antenna picks up. We find it pleasing to have linear scales (consistent spacing) for the frequency that is being picked up, but it is hard to make resistors and capacitors that adjust linearly. Because it's cheaper to just use resistors and capacitors that don't adjust linearly, the scales on old school equipment are often nonlinear and based on the what components were used in the circuit. However as components became cheaper over time, and the market had an increase in demand for user friendly electronics, aesthetic design became more important that creating the circuit in a cheap manner. Engineers went through an obsession with creating smooth, consistent, linear adjustments for everything. Now volume knobs, tuners, equalization knobs are almost all linear in order to be more intuitive to the user.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
