The one that got in continuous made buzzing noises and hitting the glass window to get out, it died within 2-3 minutes. One minute later there's about 10 bees slamming into my window trying to get in. Did the trapped bee release some sort of stress signal that I can't observe?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees release a pheromone called alarm pheromone when they sting. Other bees will orient to the scent and become aggressive. The evolutionary purpose is to coordinate the defense of the hive against predators or hostile bees.</p>
<p>After a bee stings, its stinger rips out, and the bee soon dies. (I read that the stinger is actually barbed to better injure insects with an exoskeleton, and getting pulled out by a mammal's elastic skin is just a side effect, but I'm not sure about this.) The stinger, lodged in the victims body, continues to pump venom and release alarm pheromone. </p>
<p>Africanized bees produce more pheromone and respond to it more dramatically. Thus, more bees will attack you once one has stung or prepared to sting.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees do release a pheromone after dying, to trigger removal from the hive by the other bees. Researchers have found that if they apply this pheromone to live bees it triggers the same behaviour and the other bees will remove the treated bee from the hive, even though it is still alive. </p>

<p>This work is done on brood (I thought it was on adults from being told about the study), I don't know whether the same thing has been tested on adults but I thought this was relevant to share anyway!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the bee was only trapped, but didnt sting, it might as well be the case, that a bee spotted something sweet in your apartment. Bees have a dance-like communication, which they use for sharing information about food sources with their hive.</p>
