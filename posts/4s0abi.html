It would pass through you, although its <a href="http://www.astro.spbu.ru/staff/afk/AtDatCentre/AtDatCat/Chapter3.pdf" target="_blank">electrons would be stripped from its nucleus</a> and you'd be hit by both the atomic nuclei and its electrons.  As for the effects?  You'd probably be fine if it were a single atom.  The only time I know that something like this occurred was in 1978 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Bugorski" target="_blank">Anatoli Bugorski</a> accidentally stuck his head in the path of a particle accelerator beam with protons going very near the speed of light.  He survived, <a href="http://survivor-story.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/anatoli-bugorski.jpg" target="_blank">although the consequences weren't pretty</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would fly right through you, and cause changes to any molecules it hit. It's very likely your body would never notice this, even if it hit something really important in a cell, it would just kill that cell, millions of which are dying constantly anyway. The only way it could actually hurt you would be if you got really unlucky and it hit a cell in just the right state in just the right part of the DNA to cause the cell to become cancerous. Even then the cell would probably already have to have several other previously built up errors as well.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is why radiation causes genetic damage, but of course that's many, many particles. EM radiation can behave similarly though of course your DNA is being damaged by high energy photons instead of atoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy! So this question directly relates to what I do for work. NASA has a radiation biophysics group and we study the effects for radiation on people in space. One of the things that astronauts get exposed to are called galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Typically for people on earth, this radiation is filtered out by the atmosphere, but on the ISS, people on board are exposed. Unlike gamma rays which is electromagnetic radiation, GCRs contain particle radiation- protons, helium nuclei, and HZE or high atomic number nuclei- like Titanium. Although these HZE aren't traveling at 99%c, they can be at 40-60%c. At these energies, the electrons are stripped off and its just the nucleus. From a single nuclei, you wouldn't see any effects on the organism level. Most likely one nuclei might pass through the person and not hit very much anyway- but at higher doses you do see effects. We are currently writing up the manuscript for this so I don't think I can show the photos of the cell nuclei, but we flew cells on the ISS and after 2 weeks had them fixed and stained them for DNA damage markers. Compared to ground controls that were receiving similar doses of electromagnetic radiation, but no particles, we actually see physical tracks of DNA damage in the space flow cells. It is presumed that these tracks are signatures of these HZE particles. Basically they hit your DNA and induce dsDNA breaks. There are lots of secondary effects in the cellular responses that I won't go into- gene expression changes, etc. etc. but they might be related to the microgravity environment and the whole picture gets a bit more complicated. </p>
<p>TLDR, nuclei traveling very fast are like little cannonballs that cause DNA double strand breaks all along the track where they deposit energy as they crash through your cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens to astronauts. They are above the atmosphere and get hit with cosmic ray radiation, which is mostly various atomic nuclei. Supposedly they can close their eyes and see lights as the rays pass through. It's basically just a dose of radiation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
