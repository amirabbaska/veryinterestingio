A cubic foot of helium provides about 31 grams of lift, while a cubic foot of vacuum will only provide 5 more- 36 grams. (Rough numbers, quickly googled). This is because relative to air, helium is already nearly &quot;weightless&quot;; the additional lift from removing the mass of the helium would be significantly less than the structure to withstand a vacuum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only way to achieve lift this way is to make a structure that weighs less than the air it displaces, but is strong enough not to collapse under the pressure.  At sea level the pressure is about a kilogram per square centimeter.  But the density of air there is about 1.2 kilograms per cubic meter.   Thus if you built a structure that was a cubic meter that could withstand the pressure of a kilogram per square centimeter, it would have to weigh less than 1.2 kilograms in order to float.  This is not possible with materials we know of today.  As you go further from the earth the pressure becomes less, but so does the density of air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I did some maths... it runs to a full page of hand written equations and I will not reproduce them here, but the conclusion is that the material of such a vacuum balloon would need to have a &quot;specific strength&quot; of about 1250, where &quot;specific strength&quot; is the compressive strength in MPa, divided by density in g/cm3.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet_print.aspx?matguid=de22e04486ff4598a26027abc48e6382" target="_blank">Strongest steel I know of</a> has specific strength of abt 300. No other metal is better AFAIK.</p>
<p>Carbon fibre has a specific strength of abt 2500 <em>in tension</em>. If we can reproduce this in compression then the vacuum balloon could be made. Unfortunately, right now the best we can do for compression is abt 500, because of the weight of the epoxy needed to stop the fibers from bending.</p>
<p>Carbon nanotubes have specific strengths of 40,000+, so potentially they could be used to make tiny hollow spheres in vacuum that would float in air...?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you could, if you had some super-material to make your &quot;balloon&quot; out of. This concept is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_airship" target="_blank">vacuum airship</a>. The practical flaw is that you can't just put a vacuum in a balloonâ€”it will just become really flat as you pump the air out. :) You need an incredibly strong yet light structure to contain the vacuum. Any vacuum container made with modern materials weighs muuuch more than the air it displaces (otherwise all those vacuum chambers used in scientific experiments would end up flying around the labs!).</p>
<p>This has not stopped inventors, of course. Some of the earliest conceptions of flying machines are vacuum airships. The earliest such scheme was proposed by Jesuit priest Francesco Lana de Terzi in his design for a sort of flying boat. Later inventors have come up with various schemes to create vacuum airships, none of which have ever flown.</p>
<p>Naively, a vacuum airship would appear to have the advantage of using the lightest possible lifting &quot;gas&quot;, and avoiding use of flammable hydrogen or rare helium (or even heavier alternatives like methane). Just pump the air out for lift. In reality it's not terribly more effective at lifting than hydrogen, and quite a bit more difficult to contain. The vacuum cells will be in constant danger of imploding, with potentially even deadlier results than hydrogen igniting. If your gasbag tears, you get a leak. If your vacuum cell tears, the whole thing violently implodes. You could probably design a truly safe hydrogen airship far more easily than a vacuum airship. </p>
<p>But theoretical vacuum airships do have one big advantage. The amount of lift could be changed by pumping air in and out of the interior, or dynamically altering the volume of the balloon. This would be a great advantage for cargo airships that need to offload a heavy load. Conventional airships have the problem that as soon as you offload the cargo, the suddenly-much-lighter airship wants to shoot up in the air. In real life, various schemes for conventional airships using thrusters to keep the airship on the ground or devices to compress engine exhaust to produce liquid ballast have been proposed to combat this. A vacuum airship could just reduce the amount of lift. At the end of the day, it could just let all the air back in or collapse the vacuum cells and land, a major advantage over traditional airships like the Hindenburg that had to be moored, at the mercy of wind and weather. One of the fellows to peddle the vacuum airship concept, Arthur de Bauset, mentioned this as one of the advantage of his airships. You can read about his ideas <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IH0EAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22arthur+de+bausset%22+aerial+navigation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l97qhtCTbR&amp;sig=jlULBzzve8FuJeQGQZm1EImPlYI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eKA4TMa7NYSFnQe46r23Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>In theory some sort of super-material of the future could fix the practical issues with vacuum airships. Vacuum airships have featured in SF stories that handwave such a material. The earliest I know is, amusingly enough, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan_at_the_Earth%27s_Core" target="_blank"><em>Tarzan at the Earth's Core</em></a>. They also appear in the Neal Stephenson's <em>The Diamond Age</em> (enabled by diamonoid nanotech supermaterials), and the alien shuttles in Buzz Aldrin's <em>Encounter with Tiber</em> become these to fly in planetary atmospheres. </p>
<p>I rather like the idea of the vacuum balloon, from a SFnal perspective. It's just cool. But its simply not a practical flying machine with the materials and engineering we have today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
