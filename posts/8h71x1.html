		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that we're not talking about an invasive species, wasps are absolutely essential to an ecosystem. The same applies to hornets, which are actually a type of wasp in the family Vespidae. Here are some of the many ecological roles they play: </p>
<p><strong>Pollination.</strong> Many species of wasps are pollinators that are absolutely vital for flowering plants. Many plants have symbiotic relationships with wasps, and some even depend on wasps for their existence. Probably the most famous examples are fig wasps in the family Agaonidae, which coevolved with certain kinds of fig trees. So without wasps, we would lose many species of plants. </p>
<p><strong>Predation.</strong> Many kinds of wasps (such as hornets, yellowjackets, and spider wasps) are predators that eat other insects/arachnids like spiders, beetles, and caterpillars. Since a lot of these destroy plants and other organisms, this predation serves as an important control that helps balance their numbers in order keep an ecosystem healthy and diverse. Some wasps even eat other wasps, which helps keep their own numbers in control.</p>
<p><strong>Parasitism</strong>. In addition to being predators, some wasps are also parasites that feed on other insects. As described above, this has all of the same benefits for keeping the levels of other insects in balance. (For example, <em>Encarsia formosa</em> is used as pest control on tomato plants). </p>
<p>So if we destroyed all wasps in their native habitat, we would see a rise in many insect populations, a decrease in many plant populations, and things would not be looking so good for the ecosystem as a whole. Wasps can be annoying, but they're absolutely vital to our ecosystems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from also being pollinators, they are (were?) essential to the beer/wine/bread industries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/07/26/1208362109" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interesting paper about it.</p>
<p>Apparently wasps are responsible for keeping strains of yeast in their stomachs over winter as they hibernate, which are essential for making beer wine and bread! Maybe these days that doesnt matter as much but up until a hundred years ago, it was pretty important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees, or at least the honeybee that you're probably thinking of, are not essential to the ecosystem in North America. </p>
<p>They are in fact an imported agricultural species that make life better for humans. If every European honey bee in North America were to drop dead tomorrow, flora would take a hit, as they have displaced native pollinators all across the country. In the long run, however, native ecosystems would survive; it's human agriculture that would fail in spectacular fashion. </p>
<p>The wasps, hornets, birds, and other things are pollinators in their own right. Native flora evolved along with those creatures to succeed just fine without the honey bee.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other species of native bee that fit into their own ecosystem niche. In particular, when you see news articles about bees being placed on the endangered species list, that refers to several types indigenous to the Hawaiian islands that are under threat. They, however, are not the honey bee that you see buzzing around responsible for agricultural pollination on the mainland.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
