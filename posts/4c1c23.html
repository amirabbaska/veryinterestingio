Why does a geometric ratio play such importance that it withstood evolution? </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks reddit for collectively taking my Front Page V-card. What are some applications of the golden ratio not related to biology and nature?<br />
Some people stated that the golden ratio in design it is a good starting point, i've used it for its convergence properties. Any others?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other commenters have mentioned, the exact golden ratio might not be as common but the pattern of something growing in a fractal (or more simplistically self-repeating/self-affine) pattern is very common in biology since it's the simplest way to encode a full structure using the lowest amount of information (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system" target="_blank">L-System</a>, <a href="http://www.medicographia.com/2013/01/fractals-and-their-contribution-to-biology-and-medicine/" target="_blank">fractals in biology</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesco_broccoli" target="_blank">this fractal-shaped broccoli</a>). </p>
<p>In essence to encode the golden spiral is extremely efficient and nature has a tendency to simplify things. The whole &quot;instruction&quot; to generate the spiral shape boils down to: </p>
<ul>
<li>go/grow forward</li>
<li>turn to a side with constantly increasing/decreasing angle</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase/decrease is often guided by linear growth of those older parts of the organism so that piece won't need encoding at all and the &quot;turn angle change&quot; is not exact since it's based on the organism's evolutionary reason for that turn like: maximizing sun coverage for some plants, appropriate volume increase of the shell for a growth of a snail over age, etc.</p>
<p>This fractal pattern of growth is present in many things you see as long as you can recognize that they're all part of a simple and elegant self-repeating pattern (i.e. <a href="http://polymer.bu.edu/ogaf/image/biofractals.jpg" target="_blank">see here for more fractals</a>) but the actual exact Golden Ratio is not found in nature as frequently as most people assume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It shows up whenever something grows a smaller version of itself and keeps growing (like a pine tree growing at is tip), or whenever something grows at a steady rate and adds to its previous growth (like a nautilus shell). <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3777" target="_blank">This SMBC comic</a> does a pretty good job of demystifying these &quot;miraculous&quot; patterns. As the comic points out, all the Golden Ratio means is that something is about half as big as another thing. That's bound to appear everywhere when there are things that grow and change based on how close they are to other parts of themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
