		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you have to understand that Miss/Mrs/Ms date back to the early 1900s, when women's lives were obviously split into two stages.</p>
<p>As Miss y, they lived in their father's house, under their father's name. Until marriage, women - regardless of age - were treated as dependants of their father, because women did not/could not work.</p>
<p>Once they got married, they took their husband's name, became Mrs x, and moved into their husband's house as his spouse and partner, becoming the lady of the house. If you go far back enough, it wasn't all that unusual for women to be referred to <em>by</em> their husband's names in certain circumstances (e.g. Mr John Smith's wife could be referred to as Mrs John Smith, eschewing her own first name entirely).</p>
<p>Ms was conceived as a term to be used where you didn't know the marital status of the woman in question, and you would switch to Miss/Mrs once you knew if they were married.</p>
<p>By the time we get to the late 60s and early 70s, women were embracing much more independent ways of life, and escaping from the model of maiden-to-wife. The feminist movement began to rally against the idea of a woman being defined by her marital status, and started to push the use of &quot;Ms&quot; as a generic title of women, independent of marital status, like &quot;Mr&quot; for men.</p>
<p>The term has been gradually gaining steam since then, and becomes more and more widespread by the year. &quot;Miss&quot; is now only used for very young girls, with &quot;Ms&quot; being preferred for adult women. Some married women are also choosing to continue to be known as &quot;Ms&quot; even after marriage, in the same way that some married women are no longer taking their husband's names.</p>
<p>tl;dr relic of older, less equal times. Ms is now generally more accepted, and Miss/Mrs are less popular</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mrs is a married woman. </p>
<p>Miss is for unmarried.</p>
<p>Ms is for both but in the UK it started getting used more frequently when women started getting more divorces in the 70s so it is associated with feminism in the 70s.</p>
<p>Personally it seems like a remnant of when women were defined by their connection to a man, taking a man's name on marriage as your dad hands you over at the altar, but that doesn't really matter now as long as all 3 are acceptable and women are happy with them. </p>
<p>The equivalent of Miss for men is Master but it was never as common for unmarried bachelors (once they were over 18) as for unmarried women. Men are Mr from birth nowadays but girls are Miss not Ms or Mrs. </p>
<p>Traditionally a woman's name would be omitted in formal correspondence like &quot;Mrs John Smith&quot;. It would totally have been a status thing if you married a rich man and moved in circles of powerful aristocrats or businessmen. Titles were really important too (duchess, baroness, lady). In Jane Austen it's quite apparent how they use Miss to advertise availability for marriage or as a badge of shame for an unmarried spinster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that historically a woman's status was related to her marital status, so the different tiles allowed people to know where she fit into society. A man was not judged on his marital status and so different titles were not needed. </p>
<p>While a young man was called master, this was indicative of his age, not whether or not he was married. On maturity he became a mr. A young woman was called miss, but her title did not change until she married. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
