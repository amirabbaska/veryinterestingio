		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a tube that connects your throat to your middle ear called a eustachian tube.  This tube is squeezed together the majority of the time but when you chew, yawn, swallow, etc. it opens in order to equalize the pressure in your ear with the surrounding air pressure.  This is why chewing gum on an airplane helps to make your ears feel better and avoid the painful negative or positive pressure build up.  You might have some excess mucus built up within the tube, some inflammation, or a normal anatomical variant that may be contributing to the sound you are hearing.  Many people experience this popping or clicking sound around the time they are sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have had this all my life from having had frequent ENT infections when I was a child. I can get temporary relief by getting them to drain sometimes.</p>
<p>I open my throat up as if to start a yawn deep down, and keep it open as I take multiple slow deep breaths. I open my jaw up and move it forward, and tilt my head back about 45 degrees and keep it tilted. After the first breath or two I keep my deeper throat as open as possible and close my mouth, breathing slowly in and out of my nose. It's okay to breathe through the mouth now and then too.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm making progress when the vibrating of my breathing jumps into my ears as well.</p>
<p>At some point at the end of an exhale I'll make a sharp inhaling breath through my nose which makes my ears feel really clogged up. (I don't recommend doing this if you have a head cold.) I leave my ears like that for a few seconds then make a full yawn with my throat as open as i can, and my head still tilted back, which makes my ears pop really good. As well flexing my jaw wide open and forward while deeply yawning can sometimes help with the drainage.</p>
<p>Other things I've tried sometimes is the yawning technique, then closing the nose while (not forcefully) trying to breathe out, which forces air out through the ears (but this seems to keep the fluid in place I guess); and pulling on my ear away from my head to flex the ear canal while I work my jaw open and shut, keeping it jutting out.</p>
<p>If your nose or throat feels like it's about to get runny or ticklish then you are definitely getting stuff moving around in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My 'popping' has been with me for years, is it normal? I have went to an ENT before but the specialist just briefly mentioned that there's something wrong with my eutaschian tube, possibly ETD, and there isn't anything much I can do besides living with it. It's an annoyance sometimes when it 'pops' while i talk/swallow/chill or yawn. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
