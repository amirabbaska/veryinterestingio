		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>**Okay here is the ELI5, detailed below answer below. </p>
<p>Flat water tastes different than regular water because even though the CO2 leaves the water it still leaves a large enough mass of bicarbonate that the water tastes bad (compared to regular water). The key point here is that the dissolved carbonate species (bicarbonate and carbonate) don't leave solution, just CO2. </p>
<p><em>Detailed</em>
The answers about increasing acidity are not correct. When the bottle is sealed it is supersaturated with CO2, which forms H2CO3 in water which then forms H+ and HCO3- which forms a miniscule about of H+ and CO32-. This is acidic. When the water goes &quot;flat&quot;, the CO2 leaves causing a shift in the equilibrium to the left, ie causing HCO3- to react with an H+ to form H2CO3. This <em>reduces</em> acidicity and causes the water to be more basic. You are probably tasting bitterness of &quot;basic&quot; ions (bicarbonate), not sourness of acidic ions.</p>
<p>*remember this is ELI5, I'm using terms like basic and acidic loosely. For knowledgeable, I mean increase hydroxide and decrease in hydronium. Yes, still acidic, but less so. (bicarbonate is not really a&quot; basic&quot; ion and I hate that term anyway. It has a pKa around 6.5 meaning it's a pretty good circumneutral buffer...it does taste bad though) </p>
<p>**You can try this at home. Take some baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and add it to water. It does not taste good. Like &quot;flat&quot; water. Or try baking powder if you have that.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually why Guinness made their stout partially infused with nitrogen. They wanted to make the beer less bitter, but keep the same recipe. By replacing some of the CO2 with nitrogen, the carbonic acid is reduced, thus lowering the amount of bitterness. They were the first to do this. It also makes for a more silky mouthfeel with the smaller bubbles. Yummy </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is acidic. The CO2 reacts with the water creating carbonic acid, which is what gives carbonated drinks their bite. When it goes flat, you just have regular water with the acid but no bubbles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason that I haven’t seen mentioned here is that a lot of times carbonated water will also contain a lot of minerals, TDS of 500 and higher. Manufacturers actually often carbonate mineral water to hide the taste of mineral water - once the fizziness ‘runs out’ you get to taste all the micronutrients that you otherwise wouldn’t. You can try ‘Medicinal water’ with TDS 1500 and higher and you’ll feel the taste immediately. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of folks are answering correctly here, but I think the thing that is difficult for me to understand is why bubbles/carbonation should hide/mask the acidic taste so dramatically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
