		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a simple video file that you would download from a torrent or through P2P.</p>
<p>It's an adaptive stream using what's probably a proprietary format. Meaning, if your connection slows down, the quality will adapt and look blurry. If your connection is fast, the quality will get better.</p>
<p>Most offline video players support something called variable bitrate (VBR) but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>That isn't really the issue though because if people wanted to get around that and save the videos they could. But the point is that it's not worth the effort when the subscription is so cheap and they can watch the shows immediately when they're released.</p>
<p>With that said, people <em>do</em> download Netflix shows from torrents so it does happen. Also, I believe Netflix started allowing offline viewing not too long ago so that probably makes it easier.</p>
<p>Another important point that makes it more difficult is that Netflix doesn't download the whole movie. If you pause the stream, it will only buffer so much ahead of where you are. This also allows it to pick up where you left off if your computer crashes. So there is a constant communication between your browser and Netflix that makes downloading videos a bit more tricky than they otherwise would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The monthly subscription price is cheaper than buying the hard drives necessary to save the shows you might download.</p>
<p>People don't want to pirate content, its just that when someone wants to charge an unfair price for it, or tie it down with all sorts of BS use restrictions, people will.  Netflix proves that if you ask people to pay a reasonable sum for content and provide it in a nice, easy, manner, you don't have to worry about piracy.</p>
<p>Edit:  Seeing some of the reply comments I really think you can't read my comment without also reading /u/tomatoaway 's comment (and I would like to think vice versa as well).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rather than sending the whole video as one continuous UDP procession, you can instead split it into HTTP packets and send it.</p>
<p>These packets can then contain cookie-specific information that only correctly parse data for the current web client, so copying and pasting the video address into another browser won't work because it lacks the same cookies (or that cookie is already in use).</p>
<p>Most browsers worth their salt let you jump around this though, by holding a record of all packets that were recieved and letting you save them externally.</p>
<p>Edit: I should also add, <a href="https://stallman.org/netflix.html" target="_blank">don't use Netflix/Chrome if you value an open internet</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pirate here. Been doing it for almost 10 years from sites like PirateBay, Demonoid, Kickass and even Mininova (back when it was good). Netflix really can't protect their stuff from being downloaded fully. They can protect it from things like Extensions on Google Chrome (like video downloader professional) but if someone has recording software, like Bandicam, and uploads it on a website? then it can be downloaded of course but the quality isn't that great. However most people don't download Netflix original content (house of Cards, Daredevil..) because the membership fee is so cheap, maybe something like The Walking Dead because it doesn't hit Netflix til later in the year after it finishes off the season on AMC.</p>
<p>Personally I don't see a point in pirating Netflix original shows because of how cheap it is and there are even shows and documentaries that are old enough that you'd be hard pressed to find on any pirating website. The only people who do are those who're tight for cash or live in countries where Netflix isn't available or the show itself is not available on Netflix in their region. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are always ways around it. It is difficult to download it as a file, but you can get a program to record the screen while it is playing and save that recording. I remember when I was big into downloading and got some music, but it was DRM protected so I could not copy it to another device or burn it to a disc. So I got a program that plays and records a new file and that was a good way around that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
