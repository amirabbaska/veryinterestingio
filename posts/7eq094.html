<p>The ISP is your mailman. They need to get packages to where they need to go, Reddit for example is sending you a package containing this reply. You pay the mailman monthly for a rate at which they send packages from you and to you. </p>
<p>HTTPS encrypts the package’s contents, however the ISP’s responsibility is still to move the package from A to B, and therefore needs to know what these A and B are. Therefore the postage address cannot be encrypted, and your ISP can track who you are exchanging packages with, be it Reddit or YouTube or Netflix.</p>
<p>So your ISP can’t actually see what you are viewing on Reddit, YouTube, or Netflix, but they can see which sites you are accessing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HTTPS is not a perfect solution. It prevents them from seeing what messages are exchanged but not from seeing who exchanges those messages.</p>
<p>They can see that you are on reddit but not which subedits you are viewing for example.</p>
<p>There are additional things they can see. For example some researches a while back for example showed that you could still recognize which movies a person was watching despite them being transmitted via https. The transmission itself was encrypted, but observers could still see the size of the packets transmitted and match those with what they new about the movies in netflix's library.</p>
<p>So https is good for not having the entire world see your password when you transmit it, but if you don't want your ISP to know that you are visiting wws.comcast-sucks.com they won't help you at all and in some special cases they might in theory learn much more about your browsing habits than you would want them to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to point out that my isp actually will perform man in the middle attacks to send copyright notices. I was torrenting one night and my browser wouldnt connect to https reddit. After a few seconds i got redirected to a 'copyright violations are bad, click here to restore your internet' page.  Realistically, i should be able to charge them under the CFAA for that. I couldnt believe they would stoop to MITM for copyright.....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sort of does. Your ISP cannot read HTTPS data you send or receive (for the most part)</p>
<p>But when you send data, they can see where it's destined for. When you receive data, they can see where it came from. So they can generally tell which websites you visited. But they can't tell what you <em>did</em> on those sites.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways they can <em>sometimes</em> snoop on your HTTPS traffic however.</p>
<p>If you install one of their certificates, they can potentially act as a man in the middle, reading everything you send and receive. But that requires you to manually install this certificate. It can't be done silently just by visiting a website. Alternatively, if the website has a non-HTTPS landing page, they can potentially manipulate that so that you are never forwarded to the HTTPS version.</p>
<p>But yeah, assuming your PC isn't compromised, and the <em>entire</em> site runs HTTPS, then the ISP can only tell where data packets are going and coming from, not what's in them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
