		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US military has done a lot of studies on human limits, attention spans, and sleep requirements in order to prevent tactical mistakes on long missions, especially for pilots who may run missions 20 hours in length. </p>
<p>What they discovered is that there is an optimum amount of sleep where too little is suboptimal, and too much is also suboptimal and this is in regardless of the sleep debt. When a person sleeps longer than about 9 - 10 hours they can become very groggy and feel ill when waking up. They call this sleep drunkeness or confusional arousal because the physical symptoms are similar to being hungover. It is still being studied so the exact mechanism is unknown. It is believed that excessive sleep causes the body to enter a lower energy consumption state and it slows breathing, respiration, and causes vasodilation. This could be very handy if you were injured as the excess sleep would keep you from moving and re-injuring yourself, while also allowing your body to rapidly repair the damage. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. I am a commercial crabber/fishermen. the longest I have stayed up, on nothing but caffine, was 54 hours with an occasional cat nap. After 6 hours of sleep I felt fine. During openers, on a good year, I might only get 4 hours of sleep and remain pretty functional. However after I do this kinda sleep schedule and I get a break I sometimes will sleep 14+ hours on my first day off and not feel groggy. Is there some kinda sleep &quot;debt&quot; I am paying off?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your internal rhythms are set by your circadian pacemaker, a group of cells clustered in the hypothalamus, a primitive little part of the brain that also controls hunger, thirst, and sweat. Primarily triggered by light signals from your eye, the pacemaker figures out when it’s morning and sends out chemical messages keeping the rest of the cells in your body on the same clock.</p>
<p>Scientists believe that the pacemaker evolved to tell the cells in our bodies how to regulate their energy on a daily basis. When you sleep too much, you’re throwing off that biological clock, and it starts telling the cells a different story than what they’re actually experiencing, inducing a sense of fatigue. You might be crawling out of bed at 11am, but your cells started using their energy cycle at seven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons.</p>
<p>One, the stages of your sleep happen in cycles. When you oversleep and go past that &quot;happy point&quot;, it may mean that you're entering another version of deep sleep. If you wake up during this, you're more groggy because you've interrupted a primary &quot;rehabilitation&quot; phase.</p>
<p>Two, the longer you sleep, the less time you're awake, which means less water and food/calories. The calories usually aren't a big deal since you burn little while sleeping, but the dehydration can really sting.</p>
<p>Way more to it than that, but that's a basic gist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your circadian rhythm (time of when you go to sleep and wake up) is what balances your sleep and if it is off your sleep isn't as effective. Essentially the only sleep that &quot;counts&quot; is REM sleep (dreams) and if you're out of rhythm so are your dreams. </p>
<p>Another thing is that you've now slept too long and your body needs sustenance because although you've been asleep your body has still been performing other processes.</p>
<p>It's a fairly deep topic but I tried to summarize it as best I could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
