It gives rise to a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" target="_blank">Gravitational Lensing</a>. This phenomenon was described theoretically not long after the theory of general relativity was published and was confirmed by observations in the '70s and dozens of times since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other people have already answered your question. Just wanted to make a larger point that nothing in General Relativity has been refuted. It is the second most verified and successful theory in physics (the first being Quantum Field Theory/Standard model).</p>
<p>Sure there are regimes (high energy scale or equivalently miniscule distances like the planck scale)  where we think it breaks down and needs to be modified by being combined with quantum field theory, but that is speculation and no one has observed violations of General Relativity in regimes where everyone agrees it is applicable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That means gravity affects light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes.  and this was part of Einstein's theory of general relativity being shown to be more accurate that Newton's (older) laws of gravity.</p>
<p>Newton's calculation and Einstein's general relativity produce pretty much the same result when gravity is weak (that is, most of what you see in the sky) But when it's strong they make different predictions.</p>
<p>Physicists had predicted ever since Newton's time that light ought to bend near massive objects like the sun but they didn't have chance to observe it directly.  When Einstein developed his theory it was found it predicted a different result, so there was a clear opportunity to prove its accuracy over Newtons laws.</p>
<p>Einstein completed his calculation in 1915, but it wasn't until a solar eclipse in 1919 that astronomers were able to directly observe stars near the edge of the sun in the wrong position.  (They knew this because as we orbit the sun we've made a very accurate map of the stars.  But looking at them <em>just past</em> the sun makes them be distorted out of place slightly.)  This was direct observation of the gravitational bending of light you're asking about (as light passes close to the sun it is bent away from following a straight line).  </p>
<p>So it was known that Newton's and Einstein's calculations disagreed before the light bending was directly observed.  but when it was, it was exactly as Einstein predicted: not a simple force as predicted by Newton but a bending of spacetime itself.</p>
<p>edit: corrected that light bending hadn't been observed pre-Einstein nor that people sought a more accurate model - it was observed for the first time after Einstein's calculations disagreed with Newton's</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Gravity warps space.  And since light moves through space, light is affected by gravity.  It is a true statement that was formulated mathematically by Einstein in 1915 and initially verified with observations of a solar eclipse by Sir Eddington in 1919.</p>
<p>There are other, more detailed explanations in the comments; but the space/time warping is the simplest way to think about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
