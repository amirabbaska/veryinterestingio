So the gas must be made only of particles with high energy so the temperature must be higher. </p>
<p>Summing up, what would happen is that an object at temperature T would spontaneously &quot;split up&quot; into an object with less temperature and another with higher temperature. <strong>Isn't this against thermodynamic principles? What is wrong with my reasoning?</strong> </p></div></div>

<li>
<p>Temperature is a statistical property.  An object with uniform temperature may still contain individual constituents with a range of kinetic energies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vapor pressure doesn't necessarily require that the vapor molecules are more energetic than the liquid molecules.  The binding forces are different for molecules at the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>At a triple point, you can have a solid, liquid, and gas all in thermal equilibrium</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The principle of thermodynamics at play here is that heat flows from high temperature systems to low temperature system. The flaw with your reasoning is that you are simply forgetting this idea. </p>
<p>If you start a container just large enough to contain the liquid, so that there is no vapor phase, and then you increase the size of the container, then a vapor phase will occupy the new volume. Initially this vapor phase will have a higher temperature than the liquid, but over time the vapor phase will exchange energy with the liquid, and the temperature of the two phases will equilibrate. </p>
<p>The other thing you could image is that instead of increasing the size of the container by a finite amount, you take away the walls of the container completely. In this case the vapor phase flies away to infinity and so is not in thermal contact with the liquid. In this case, the two phases really have different temperatures, but this is allowed by thermodynamics because the two phases are not in thermal contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>No, the particles lost their additional energy from escaping the liquid.</p>
<p>Temperature is more than just kinetic energy. Anyway, the temperature is exactly the same in all phases in equilibrium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When dealing with laws of thermodynamics and temperature you cannot deal with individual particles. Any liquid or gas has a variety of particles with different energy states. The temperature is a statistical sample of these.</p>
<p>If you have a sealed container with vapour above a liquid, once equilibrium is reached they are at the same temperature because that is what equilibrium means. No net energy is transferred between them (or more accurately they both add the same amount to each other).</p>
<p>If you suddenly made the container bigger, the available space would increase, the gas would expand and pressure would drop in the gas. This would allow for more evaporation and cooling until a new equilibrium is reached. The overall system would have the same energy less the energy required to expand so would overall be slightly cooler but the gas and liquid would still reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>Perhaps a reason for the confusion is that &quot;temperature&quot; is not really a measure of the amount of energy something has but more a measure of the direction of heat flow in relation to something else. </p>
<p>What you are thinking about is similar to Maxwells Demon. There are several youtube videos that would explain this better than I could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
