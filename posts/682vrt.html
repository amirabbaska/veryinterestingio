		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so I was victim of identity fraud.</p>
<p>Here's how it went down, I'm Dutch though so it maybe different wherever you're from.</p>
<p>About a year after I moved from The Hague to a smaller town, I got a letter in the mail from a debt collectors office stating I hadn't paid bills for an iPhone 6 by a certain provider. Two things: I did not own nor have I ever owned an iPhone 6, and I had never been with that particular provider. So I called the debt collectors and told them about this. I also asked for any information they could give me, but they couldn't release an info at that time. So then I called that provider and explained what had happened. They couldn't give me very much info, but they were able to tell me that my passport had been used to sign the contract, no payments had ever been made, and the adress given was an adress I've never lived at. They couldn't tell me what the exact adress was but they were allowed to disclose the street name to confirm I did not live there. The provider was going to start an investigation and adviced me to file a report with the police additionally. </p>
<p>I looked up the street on Google maps and found out it was very close to the building I used to live. I lived in student accommodation then and I highly suspect it was an employee in the facility. I had never shown my passport to anyone, I wasn't social in the building at all, I had also never lost it. I did however, have to leave a copy at the front desk. So yeah.</p>
<p>I filed a report with the police and any charges from the provider against me were dropped. I never found out who it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can happen.  I had my identity stolen in the 90s.  The person used it for several years and I never knew until a routine traffic stop and I was hauled off to jail for 9 felony warrants out for my arrest.  How did I not know?  They used my drivers license number as their social security number so my credit was never affected.  </p>
<p>Edit to add they were issued a new license with the same number as mine that they also used as their ss#.  They had checks in my name and my mothers address where I didn't live anymore.  Apartments in my name.  The whole shebang.  She even bought a car as me.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got a bank card in the mail once I didn't open, called to cancel and it was like an online bank I'd never heard of. No clue. Cancelled it before anyone could do any damage with the online account, because card has to be activated first anyway. Apparently this was a test to see if my info is valid before moving on to harder pulls because this online bank is mostly used by students for building credit or something and its easy for ANYONE to get approved no matter credit score. I then put in a police report, filed fraud with that banks fraud department, and I changed all of my passwords immediately. Even reddit. I also monitor my credit religiously, which helped me learn a lot more about it, and I've boosted my score to like top 1% of users. All in all, if you don't pay attention and aren't knowledgeable you can get screwed over pretty quickly. I always check for card scimmers at stores too, and worry about Target or Home Depot hacks like near the holidays. I always try and pay cash on Black Friday or doing holiday shopping now and for like a month before and after. Basically never use my cards at any stores October to January if I can help it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should be checking your credit report 3 times per year (Once from each bureau) via www.annualcreditreport.com.</p>
<p>Whenever you apply for a loan, a CC, an apartment, they check your credit, and those things show up.</p>
<p>So if you see ABC Bank pulled your credit, and you're like 'who the F are they?' you know somebody has your info.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you never check that stuff, and you get sued for the debt they rack up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most people don't even realize that their personal info has been stolen until they try to get financing for a big purchase. For relatively frequent checks into your credit, credit karma is good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
