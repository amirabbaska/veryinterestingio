		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You ever wonder what Willy-Coyote would do the day after he catches Road Runner?</p>
<p>He has spent decades, his whole existence, building elaborate traps and now the reason for doing it is gone.  You think he might build traps (or design them) for old times sake?</p>
<p>That is you.  We won the evolution game.  For our whole existence food was scarce, physical exertion was common and burned precious calories (and was to be avoided wherever possible).  Our evolutionary success came from using our brains to figure out how to be lazy and build a pipeline to a river instead of carrying buckets of water back and forth all day.</p>
<p>And now, we have caught and eaten the road runner.  We can eat anything we want whenever we want.  We can spend days laying on the couch watching tv.  We are masters of our world...</p>
<p>And so we do... But it turns out it isn't good for us.  We weren't supposed to win we were supposed to always keep struggling for the unattainable.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One explanation is basically the flip side of why we tend to eat rich foods that aren't healthy in the long run. For nearly all of our evolutionary history, the overwhelming goal was to consume and store enough food energy to survive long enough to reproduce and raise children. Expending energy for no reason was a waste of hard-earned calories. And who needs extra motivation to get moving when you've got hunger?</p>
<p>Besides, many of the disadvantages of not exercising are chronic and don't really flare up until long after we're capable of reproduction, making them less relevant to natural selection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your evolutionary past, you didn't have a choice. Your daily life was exercise. Therefore, it made more sense for evolution to say &quot;rest and conserve your energy when you can, so you'll have more energy to tackle necessary activity. Because you don't know when you will get your next meal.&quot;</p>
<p>Now you <em>do</em> have a choice. Lots of people can get through life just fine being lazy when it comes to physical activity. But no selective pressures have served to erase that whole 'conserve your strength' impulse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans of old had exercise built into their everyday activities - from hunting/gathering, building, etc. Now that humans have learned to manipulate our ecosystem via machinery/processes/etc, these physical activities aren't needed by large swaths of humans. </p>
<p>Exercise that used to happen due to necessity doesn't happen anymore. Survival is one hell-of-a-motivator. Your day-to-day survival is not in question (I assume) due to health reasons. But, ever notice someone who got a &quot;health scare&quot; like a heart diagnosis? They may be a lot more motivated to go exercise. </p>
<p>We must also realize that food used to be extremely scarce and difficult to get. Who knows when'd you eat. In some countries, still, famine is a regular occurrence. In this case it makes sense to conserve energy. So not only is setting out to exercise at a gym seen as a disadvantage, the mind may see it as downright detrimental! Adding more fuel to the fire...</p>
<p>In my personal experience, consistent exercise only became possible when I truly understood the logical benefits of a physically fit body. In addition, sexual attraction is one heck of a motivator! This may be why many couples tend to gain weight - attracting a mate may have been their main goal in exercising. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because aside from a slightly better optimized prefrontal cortex, you are biologically the same as a hunter on the savannah 50,000 years ago. And that hunter needs to conserve energy to survive, so his body tells him it wants carb- and fat-rich foods and to limit physical activity (because he gets exercise anyway). Our species has existed for 200,000 and the sedentary lifestyle has been a problem for, what, barely 50 years? Your body hadn't had time to evolve to fit your new environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
