		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mama, papa, baba (in languages such as Chinese). M, P and B are all bilabial consonants, we make them by putting the lips together. M is just using your voice with your lips together. P and b are plosive consonants, b is voiced, p isn't.</p>
<p>Basically, babies make these words very easily and dads and mums across cultures think they are naming us. Mama is the easiest to make and mums traditionally spend more time with the babies so they took that one.</p>
<p>TL:DR - the babies named the adults</p>
<p>Edit: Anything do do with babies brings up a lot of anecdotal evidence as they don't all follow the same steps, and often we are a little biased in what we are hearing as well. </p>
<p>u/stupidstray gave an excellent breakdown as to why many parents might hear 'dada' before 'mama' <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8erl8z/eli5_why_are_the_words_for_mom_and_dad_so/dxxp74o/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>There's a lot of academic research about language acquisition in babies. <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=where-do-mama2.pdf&amp;site=1" target="_blank">this one</a> basically sums up a lot of it. There's so much more. p.16 is where it starts answering this question in particular.</p>
<p>u/MudkipzFetish posted <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2017/08/john_mcwhorter_on_proto_indo_european_mama_and_papa.html" target="_blank">this podcast: Did Cavemen Say Mama and Papa</a> which gets into this subject. It's really interesting. </p>
<p>Someone said that knowing this ruins the magic, which is fair enough. I think it makes it more magical when you know what's going on when listening to them babbling away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My 7 month old started making some consonants noises recently.  Guess what the first sounds she made were?</p>
<p>da da da da da </p>
<p>and (specially when crying)</p>
<p>ma... ma... ma</p>
<p>we name ourselves after the noises that babies make.  Pa Pa Pa is also and easy one, as is baba (Arabic for dad).</p>
<p>before should could make consonant sounds she used to just say, &quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot; all the time.  She still does that actually.  Its horrible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words like &quot;mama&quot; or &quot;papa&quot; consist of the simplest consonants (both the &quot;m&quot; and &quot;p&quot; sounds only involve the lips, requiring no complex tongue movements) and the simplest vowel (simply vocalizing with an open mouth will get you an &quot;a&quot; sound).</p>
<p>Babies will naturally learn these sounds first, no matter where they are born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anthony Burgess believed there was a innate reaction to certain stimuli which explained the similarities of certain words across different cultures.  Primitives would look up at the moon and make a sound like &quot;Loo,&quot; which became words like &quot;Luna.&quot;  He used his theories when he created an artificial primitive language for the movie Quest for Fire (1981).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
