		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sickle cell anemia. Kinda. If you have the homozygous trait then you’re sick and that sucks, but if you have the heterozygous trait then you have a protective advantage against malaria, which is great for people living in malaria-endemic places. </p>
<p>Also there’s a field of study on the benefit of helminths (intestinal worms) on the digestive system. Taking an evolutionary approach, there is a possibility that one of the reasons the people of today have so many intestinal issues is actually due to the lack of mutualistic parasites in our environment. Kind of a friend not foe situation. </p>
<p>Lots of other stuff too. The field of evolutionary medicine is filled with this kind of research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cystic fibrosis is kinda along these lines. A homozygote for CF is pretty much doomed to die of lung infections at a young age.  Heterozygotes, though, are thought to be resistant to the dehydration and in imblalances associated with cholera and typhus.</p>
<p>This is heterozygote advantage, as another also explained with sickle cell anemia (interestingly, other areas of the world have different hemoglobin equivalents with mutations at different spots).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marfan Syndrome is a condition that affects connective tissues in the body. It makes people taller than average, with unusually long limbs/fingers and their joints may also be hyper mobile. It’s speculated that these traits helped musicians like Paganini (violinist) and Rachmaninov (pianist) excel in their work. </p>
<p>It does however tend to come with significant heart and eye complications too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have found relief of ulcerative colitis by infecting themselves with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/magazine/the-parasite-underground.html" target="_blank">worms</a>.  I've read stories like this off and on since the late 2000s - I guess hookworms and whipworms are used here.</p>
<p>No clue on the science behind it, but some patients claim that the worm infections cure an otherwise unsolvable issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely saw this one make its way up reddit not too long ago but parasitic infection of Toxoplasma gondii from cats. There's a relationship between the infection and certain psychological disorders that I wouldn't call beneficial, but it also has been linked to success in the business world for the way it affects behavior in regards to risk-taking. In infected rats it means they are less averse to cats a.k.a. predators than non-infected individuals, and I guess the parallel to humans is that infected individuals are somewhat more likely to be willing to make risky decisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
