<p><strong>Our experts are here to answer your questions, and this year we have a treat that's <em>almost</em> sweeter than pi: we've teamed up with some experts from /r/AskHistorians to bring you the history of pi.</strong> We'd like to extend a special thank you to these users for their contributions here today!</p>
<p>Here's some reading from /u/Jooseman to get us started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The symbol π was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when Welsh Mathematician William Jones (a man who was also close friends with Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley) used it in his work <em>Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos</em> (or a <em>New Introduction to the Mathematics</em>.) There are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. The favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient Greek word for periphery (the circumference).</p>
<p>Before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.</p>
<p>The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work <em>Mechanica</em> and finally it was his use of it in the widely read <em>Introductio</em> in 1748 that really helped it spread.</p>
