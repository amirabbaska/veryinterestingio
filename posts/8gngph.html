		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great question, check out <a href="http://www.ericweinhoffer.com/blog/2017/7/30/the-whitworth-three-plates-method" target="_blank">this article</a> for a good explanation of how to get a really flat surface without having one to reference in the first place. Basically, you rub 3 plates together alternatively and see where the high spots are and scrape them down gradually. Three plates that completely match up in any pair can only be perfectly flat, or planar. If you only used two, you could get one concave and one convex while still having perfect contact. </p>
<p>This method can produce super flat granite surface plates for measuring which is very important to making accurate parts, or produce machine ways (guides) which is what allows something like a CNC mill to machine flat parts. We obviously don’t use this method every time we want a flat base now that we have references and accurate machines, but that’s how you could start from nothing and get to where we are today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is perfect, but you can use crude tools to make progressively better ones.</p>
<p>Round things can be made with rotation.  A string around a fixed point, a lathe turning a workpiece, a grinding wheel, etc.</p>
<p>Flat things can be made with tension, pulling something flexible and using it as a reference.</p>
<p>You can also use geometrical properties to refine precision. Three surfaces ground against each other tend to make a plane.  The high points on each eliminate each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way to create a straight line without having one is to take a piece of string and stretch it. </p>
<p>The way to create a circle without having one is to use a compass. If you don't have one, you can easily make one from a piece of string: attach it to the ground at one end (center of the circle) and rotate the other end around it. E.g. by using a thumbtack to attach it and tying a pencil to the other end for drawing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
