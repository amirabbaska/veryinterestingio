		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to the idea that corporations are legally &quot;people,&quot; the courts have upheld the notion that political contributions are an exercise of &quot;free speech&quot; by these <em>people</em>, and the <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> ruling by SCOTUS removes the caps on these donations and allows the donors to remain anonymous, thereby creating the perfect storm for the sort of campaign contribution abuse to which you allude.</p>
<p>And, yes, it has created an environment in which our elected representatives are beholden more to their benefactors, the ones who enable them to be elected and to keep their jobs, than they are to &quot;we the people.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify, <em>Citizens United</em> does not permit massive corporate contributions directly to the coffers of individual politicians or political parties, by establishing procedural and policy hoops they have to leap through. However, there is never any question where the money is coming from or for whom or what it is intended, so the net result is still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll provide a more macro perspective on this because I think it helps. One must ask first, why would the government deny anyone the right to do anything that they want? If two people make an agreement whos the government (being the third party) to come in and tell them that the agreement they made is void? </p>
<p>And so we come to a very old idea between two parties regarding the freedom to contract with one another. This old idea is incorporated across the world in many different ways from the most simple of cultures to massive political systems such as the USA. Determining whether agreements are equitable between parties or bad for public policy or many other things is what each governments burden is when creating laws that suppress this original freedom.</p>
<p>So to answer your question in a nonspecific way, the United States has not abolished (although they have made some campaign finance reform in other ways) this idea... yet. </p>
<p>I hope my answer was helpful as a foundation for the basis of your question in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, it does NOT go into their pockets. Not legally, at least. It is used to help them campaign, achieve reelection, and achieve other political goals. The problem is, it's still possible to &quot;buy&quot; or unfairly influence politicians by giving lots of money to their reelection campaigns. </p>
<p>Why is it allowed? There is an argument that it's free expression or free speech. You can give up your yard for a campaign sign, give up your internet bandwidth to share campaign slogans on social media, give up your time to call people and encourage them to vote for your cause.</p>
<p>Why can't you spend money in other ways to help the causes you believe in? Of course this can be incredibly unfair and has a lot of potential for abuse and corruption. But that's the basis of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of wrong answers here.  Very simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporations cannot give money to politicians directly.</li>
<li>Corporations cannot donate money to politicians' campaigns.</li>
<li>Corporations <em>can</em> spend money to advertise on political <em>issues</em>, but not [edit] in cooperation with a campaign.</li>
<li>Certain corporations have publicly advocated for or against candidates for most of the nation's history.  We call those corporations &quot;newspapers&quot;.  The <em>Citizens United</em> Supreme Court decision basically made it so that any corporation could endorse a political candidate without having to go through the hassle of buying a newspaper.  But that's not the same as giving money to a campaign, and certainly not the same as giving money directly to a candidate.</li>
<li>Most of what's reported as &quot;corporations giving money to politicians&quot; is actually <em>people who work for corporations</em> making <em>individual</em> donations to a campaign.  There are websites that track this, but again, it's often incorrectly reported as &quot;Walmart gave $$$$ to Senator X&quot;, when it's actually people who work for Walmart who made individual donations.</li>
<li>Individual people <em>are</em> allowed to make donations to political campaigns, because that's how they're funded.  But it's limited in size so that super-rich people can't basically buy a candidate.  People who work for corporations can give money just like people who don't.</li>
<li>There have been some proposals to make campaign costs be paid for by the government rather than from donations, but there's a serious problem with those proposals - they really help people who are already in office.  People who are already in office have good name recognition and already have connections with the media, so they have a huge advantage over challengers.  Fund-raising is one of the few ways that challengers have of getting an advantage over a veteran politician.</li>
<li>There is corruption and it is a real thing, but for the most part, this isn't it.  Corruption tends to be more of an informal arrangement - where a politician looks out for a corporation or other special interest, then they offer him or her a cushy job or super-generous &quot;consulting fees&quot; or &quot;speaking fees&quot; after they leave office.  That's entirely legal, but seriously questionable ethically, but it happens all the time.  But again, this isn't it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of lobbying for political favor is just the people asking for what they want.</p>
<p>However, it becomes a problem when people organize themselves into groups, and then lobby on behalf of their own interests as opposed to what's good for everyone.</p>
<p>These groups are often businesses, and businesses do what businesses are supposed to: make money. When a business lobbies for political favor, they are asking for special treatment in order to operate differently, and therefore, at an advantage to the competition. In order to achieve this goal, bribes are given, under the presumption that the bribed will work politically to improve the briber's ability to dodge competition or cut corners.</p>
<p>The problem isn't so much the bribes, it's where they are coming from. It's who is allowed to make the &quot;donations&quot;.</p>
<p>Money is necessary in politics because campaigning is expensive, and politicians don't directly create anything of value. As such, they must be allowed to accept money.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the first step to fixing government is to fund campaigns via tax money and forbid direct donations. Appeals to political favor made through rhetoric, not money. And to best fight against under the table bribes, require campaigns to set goals and make promises that they must pursue, otherwise they forfeit their position and a new election is held.</p>
<p>When individuals are politicians focus not  collectives, then we can have good government.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
