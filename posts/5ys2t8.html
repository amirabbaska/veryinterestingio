		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Double jeopardy prevents someone from being re-charged with a crime after having been acquitted of same.  So if, for example, you reside in the state of California, and you are validly tried for the murder of John Doe and acquitted, you may never be re-tried for the murder of John Doe, whether by California, another state, or the federal government.  This is true even if you hold a press conference the next day to say &quot;Guess what?  I did it!&quot;  Post-acquittal confessions are not common--most people who get away with crimes are smart enough not to draw attention to this fact--but it's not unknown.  In most cases, those people do not face additional criminal charges due to double jeopardy.</p>
<p>But of course, no legal answer can be that simple.  As other responses have noted, the doctrine of dual sovereignty means that the federal government and individual states are treated as distinct from each other, each with their own law, and each with the authority to bring prosecutions for the violation of their law.  It is therefore possible that a single set of actions can constitute crimes in multiple jurisdictions, and while a failed prosecution for one charge eliminates the ability to bring the same charge (or a reasonably similar charge) a second time, this does not mean that sufficiently distinct charges are barred, as well.  Bottom line, under certain limited circumstances, the federal government may bring a prosecution concerning the same events (though not the same charges) as a failed state prosecution, and vice versa.  In the case of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), the Supreme Court announced a rule that still applies regarding the scope of double jeopardy:  following acquittal, the government may bring a second prosecution on additional charges arising out of the same underlying events as the first prosecution so long as both the new crime charged and the prior crime each contain an element of proof that the other does not.  </p>
<p>Let's go back to the California example, where the defendant has beaten a murder charge for killing John Doe, let's call it second-degree murder.  After the state acquittal, the federal government cannot come in and bring a first-degree murder charge:  this is because while first-degree murder contains elements not present in second-degree murder, there are no elements of second-degree murder not present in first-degree murder, so the later prosecution would fail the Blockburger test.  Going in the other direction, the federal government cannot charge with a less severe offense such as battery, since battery is a lesser-included offense (i.e., it is subsumed) in murder.  However, if the federal government wanted to charge the defendant with a violation of the victim's civil rights, 18 U.S.C. 242, that would potentially be possible, because there, the crimes have substantially different elements.  Therefore, in a situation where a criminal confessed guilt after acquittal, there might still exist other crimes in other jurisdictions that pass the Blockburger test and allow for a second prosecution.</p>
<p>Further, as Jennifer Huber-Julie has rightly pointed out, double jeopardy has nothing to do with the civil system, so a failed criminal prosecution does not impact one's ability to bring a civil suit.  (Note that there are protections against civil retrial, e.g., res judicata and collateral estoppel, but a failed civil suit would not preclude criminal charges, either.)  So confessing to a crime would open the door for a possible civil lawsuit--in the case of murder, the tort of wrongful death would apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread is a good illustration of why you should be wary of legal advice on the Internet.</p>
<p>You cannot be found innocent of a crime. You are found either guilty or not guilty. Not guilty might mean the jury  think you did it, but are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Several things might happen to you if you are found not guilty and later admit to committing the crime.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you testified you may face charges related to perjury. Depending on the severity of the crime the prosecutor might try and charge you with contempt or some form of obstruction of justice. I'm not sure they would be successful, but they would probably throw whatever they could think of at you. Even if found not guilty they would get some satisfaction of disrupting your life and possibly holding you in custody until trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could possibly be tried by a different sovereign. If you were found not guilty in state court, double jeopardy does not prevent the federal government from prosecuting you for the same conduct. </p>
</li>
<li>You will likely face a civil lawsuit from the victim or victims family. This again depends on the crime. </li>
