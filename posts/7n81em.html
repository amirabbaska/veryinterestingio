		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Niagara Falls” is actually three waterfalls, the “American”, the “Bridal veil”, and the “Horseshoe”  falls.  Never in recorded history have all three of them completely frozen, but the smaller two (American and Bridal Veil”) have frozen a few times.  When it happens, most of the water on the surfaces of Lake Erie and the Niagara river is already frozen so the volume of water going over the falls is reduced anyway. The rest of the moving water goes over the unfrozen parts of the Horseshoe falls.  Besides this, two big hydroelectric power plants, one American and one Canadian, divert water away from the falls to generate electricity.  This means the river and the falls have less water than they can handle anyway.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned in previous posts, much of the water gets diverted to hydro electric plants. In the summer, during the day, there is an agreement that states the water cannot he diverted as much. This is so that tourists can see the falls “in all their glory”. At nighttime and during the winter, much more is diverted for energy production. </p>
<p>As for your question. Historically speaking, ice bridges have formed, even to the point where people would play on the bridges, set up a market, and walk across to the other country’s side. This has been illegal since 1912, but even while this happened, water still flowed over the falls. Although the ice bridge was thick and sturdy, the fast flowing water runs beneath the ice, so it can look like the falls have frozen, but there is still water flowing over them, along and behind the ice. Think of it like an icy covering that’s hiding the real flow of water. </p>
<p>There is only one instance of the falls completely freezing over, about 150 years ago, however all the other water had completely frozen as well, so the side effects were minimal. </p>
<p>tl;dr
If Niagara Falls ever did completely freeze over, the rest of Lake Erie probably did to, so there would be no concern for flooding or anything of the sort. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The falls are never truly frozen--as in frozen solid with no flow. Think about a river or lake that freezes over. The ice may be quite thick but there is still water underneath. The river is still flowing below that solid sheet of ice. So in the case of the falls, you may see ice, but there is still flow behind it. It is always flowing even in the coldest winters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So not one has really answered the question asked. </p>
<p>What would happen if Niagra falls stopped flowing completly (let's also assume the other diversions like hydro-power don't exist. </p>
<p>Yes, the water would start to rise behind it however it's not going to be as dramatic as you think. The river is actually just an extension of Lake Erie. In effect, you would be increasing the volume of Lake Erie since the river level is also the lake level. Lake Erie has a natural fluctuation of about a foot and historically has fluctuated about three feet (different between the max lowest level and max highest level). I can't find data for the current level however the last couple years the level has been around the average which put's it about a foot below the historical maximum. This means that it could conceivably rise a foot without causing too much of a problem (possibly some local minor flooding).</p>
<p>Lake Erie has a surface area of 25 744 Km^2</p>
<p>To raise Lake Erie by 1 cm, you would need to add 2.57 x 10^11 L of water. </p>
<p>2.84 x 10^6 L of water flows over Horseshoe, the American Falls, and Bridal Veil falls per second. </p>
<p>This means that if you shut off the falls completely (again, not accounting for the hydro production), the water level of Lake Erie would rise by 1 cm every 25h or, about a foot a month. </p>
<p>All of this assumes that the volume of water flowing in to the lake remains constant. In reality, the water levels won't rise that fast since the inflow of water is also reduced for similar reasons (less water is flowing in the winter as it stays frozen on the ground). This is also a very simplistic view since it doesn't take in to account evaporation which also fluctuates depending on how frozen over the lake is. </p>
<p>As others have pointed out though, completely freezing over doesn't mean that water isn't flowing. It's just a reduction in flow. There is only one instance where the water completely stopped flowing which happened in <del>1948</del> 1848 as a result of an ice jam. This only lasted a couple hours though. The American Falls have previously been artificially shut off as well for maintenance (erosion prevention measures)</p>
<p>EDIT: As pointed out by /u/Cumberlandjed, the drop to the top of the rapids is 2.7m. I originally discounted the drop since I didn't think it would be that significant. As such, depending on where the blockage happened and the height of the banks, you might just end up with localized flooding which would eventually cause the stream to divert around the blockage and flow to the canyon through another route. If the banks are high enough to contain the river over the drop, my scenario would still hold. Essentially the river would increase to the lake level. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Niagara River flows down towards the brink, where the river splits in two to go around a large island (Goat Island) perched on the brink. The American half may freeze over, but the Canadian (Horseshoe) half rarely if ever does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top layer of the American Falls often freezes over while current continues to flow under.</p>
</li>
<li>Some water is channeled off into the hydroelectric generating stations on either side of the river, where it bypasses the falls entirely and runs through tunnels, canals, reservoirs, and generators as it drops to the level of the lower Niagara River. </li>
