		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As most of the answers here don't explain what actually happens I thought I'd give it a go.
The reason this happens is due to the refraction of the sound waves. They refract as the wind speed increases with altitude, so even in strong winds, the wind speed at your feet is practically 0.
This effect in a headwind causes the sound to refract upward and be lost faster and a tailwind the sound refracts downwards. If you google sound refraction in wind there are some good images which show the effect clearly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see the responses so far.. So a follow-up question:</p>
<p>Is there measurable loss to sound travel caused by an AVERAGE wind?</p>
<p>I know temperature, humidity, etc are probably a factor but..</p>
<p>If someone were to play a constant sound (or an intermittent sound if that changes things) in huge, otherwise open area.. How much of a change would a say, 15mph (~24kph) wind make in the distance it could be heard?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like many posters have said unless the wind is moving at the speed of sound it can't be &quot;blown away&quot; however a strong wind can make a sound dissipate more than it would in still air, making the noise seem artificially farther away.
Think of rowing a boat up stream, you could travel the same distance as still water but more energy would  be lost to get there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is basically mechanical vibrations in the medium (in this case, air) so any movement in air is going to impact how well someone will receive the sound coming from you. As well as other noise in the medium will affect the transmission of sound too. If you are in really strong wind, depending on the angle of the wind between two of you, it can seriously change how well they can hear you. </p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that your voice doesn't need to be completely &quot;blown away&quot; for it to be indiscernible. If it is at the same or lower amplitudes as compared to other sounds in the environment, the reciever will have a hard time understanding you as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only way for your words to be completely &quot;blown away&quot; would be for the wind to be moving at the speed of sound (about 767 mph).  Since you'd be dead if you were exposed to winds of that speed, it's just the wind noise drowning the sound out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
