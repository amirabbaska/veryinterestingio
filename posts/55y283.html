If they start out stationary with respect to eachother, the marble will simply fall towards the bowling ball (and vice versa). In order for the marble to enter orbit, it needs to have sufficient sideways velocity (where &quot;sideways&quot; is defined as perpendicular to the line connecting the two objects).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now if a marble were to drift past the bowling ball at just the right speed and distance, then yes, the marble certainly could begin to orbit the bowling ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, (cracking knuckles) looks like it's time to fire up the ole' Universe Sandbox again. Fortunately, it already has a bowling ball as one of the default objects. As for a marble? We'll just start with a billiard ball and shrink it. The &quot;standard&quot; marble (if there is such a thing) is about 9/16&quot; in diameter. We'll make it more sciencey by saying about 15mm. A little google research has shown that its mass is typically about 5 grams, so that should work for our simulation. We'll start them out about oh, say, 10 meters apart; because why not? The simulation assumes that both objects are at rest relative to each other. So any motion that occurs will be due entirely to the effect of gravity between them. In theory, they should both start moving toward one another, although the marble will gain speed much more noticeably than the bowling ball since it is significantly less massive. Let's see how it goes!</p>

<p>SPOILER ALERT!!</p>
<p>Gravity works. Albeit <em>very slowly</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The marble will have a circular orbit if it has a lateral velocity of .002273 centimeters per second.</p>
<p>It will have a &quot;year&quot; of about 3 days and 4 hours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure OP is making some basic assumptions.</p>
<p>So yes, the marble can theoretically orbit the bowling ball, but only if you throw the marble at the right speed and in the right direction.</p>
<p>However, if you just place them in space like an arms length apart, with no momentum, they would just get pulled together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
