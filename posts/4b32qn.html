		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that having eyes that are lighter in color 1) can cause discomfort (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia" target="_blank">photophobia</a>) and reduced contrast by allowing more stray light in, but 2) cannot allow for higher visual acuity (an improved ability to collect and focus light).</p>
<p>To understand both parts of the answer, let's start by looking at the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_en.svg/756px-Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_en.svg.png" target="_blank">diagram of the eye</a>. The part of the eye that determines its color is the iris. Specifically darker eyes are caused by a higher concentration of biological pigments like melanin, while eyes that are lighter in color have smaller concentration of such compounds. Now the purpose of the iris is to essentially act as a diaphragm that controls how much light gets into your pupil and then gets focused by the lens onto the retina. A good analogy is to think of the iris as the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KgRVPBI.jpg" target="_blank">diaphragm in a camera shutter</a>, which controls the aperture that lets light in. An ideal diaphragm should allow all light through the aperture, but block off all the light around it. In this sense a better iris can't really allow you to collect more <em>useful</em> light (again, because the pupil is basically a hole in the iris), but it <em>can</em> cause problems by letting stray light through,  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2u3qbpC.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. </p>
<p>Because a more transparent iris allows more stray light through, people with lighter eyes can have certain problems in conditions of intense light and glare. One problem is that the stray light that makes it into your eye (called intraocular stray light (IOSL)) can make it hard see what is ahead of you. For example, imagine you are driving on a wet road and the beams of the cars around you are reflected around you. The effect of this stray light is to flood your field of vision with a bright diffuse blur. As a result, it becomes harder to see what you are looking at and your net contrast is reduced (a problem called contrast sensitivity). Finally, in conditions of bright light (i.e. strong sunlight), having a lighter eyes means that more unwanted light can enter your eye and cause discomfort.</p>
