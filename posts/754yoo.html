		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is what someone said on another thread:</p>
<p>There's a phenomenon called 'osmosis' which plays its role here.
When two different liquids with different concentrations are separated by a semipermeable membrane (the one that allows one-way flow only), the liquids would flow in such a way that they attain a state of equilibrium, i.e. now the concentration of both the liquids is same.
The bacteria which cause the sore throat also have their skin similar to a semipermeable membrane. When you gargle with salty water, the inner 'fluid' of bacteria (which makes them live, in a literal sense) oozes out (in order to equalize the concentrations of these fluids-salt water and bacterial body fluid). This kills the bacteria and their 'active fluid' is washed away when you gulf-out the liquid. Thus they loose their dominance on the sore throat and you feel relaxed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the correct answer is it shrinks the swelling of the inflames pharyngeal tissue through simple osmosis- the water passes out of the tissue in order to dilute the salt water. The Chlorine also has some bactericidal activity, but we are usually talking about a virus here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be a lot of misinformation and false responses to this question. Even if salt did kill bacterias or viruses it wouldn't help to immediatly relieve the pain a sore throat causes. The more likely explanation is that the salt draws out liquid from the inflamed throat reducing inflamation as well as the salt having a numbing effect by overstimulating the nerves pain stimulus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
