It doesn't seem like there's any test you can do determine that without a lot of supporting evidence or advanced equipment.   Were people mistaking compounds for elements as they made discoveries?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying a whole battery of reactions, basically. One of the most important is whether anything significant happened if you heated the substance up in a vacuum, as many compounds would tend to decompose on heating. But you can heat a chunk of carbon or phosphorus or metal and so on in a vacuum all day and nothing will happen. That's the thing about elements, they're unchanging while compounds are not.</p>
<p>Other tests were more specific; if the substance was a suspected metal, you would try to create the corresponding salts - oxides; sulfates, nitrates and so on. You could then crystallize and examine those properties. They would test for various compounds by using reactions that would react with specific functional groups (even before they knew what a 'functional group' was), for instance decarboxylation reactions to reveal carboxylic acids. (This is also how early organic chemical structural analysis was done in the late 19th century)</p>
<p>I (as generations of chemistry students before me) have tried my hand at classical 19th century qualitative analysis; If you have an unknown metal ion in solution, you can more or less follow a procedure of sorts: Does it form a precipitate at high, low or medium pH? Does it form an insoluble salt with nitrate? sulfate? carbonate? sulfide? sulfite? nitrite? At which pHs? What solubility does the salt have? What melting point does it have?</p>
<p>In the early 19th century you ahd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead_test" target="_blank">bead tests</a> but by the late 19th century you had spectroscopy (in the visible region) and we'd realized each element had its own distinct spectrum. That lead to the discovery of elements we'd not even found in the laboratory yet, such as helium - named after the sun because it was observed in the sun's spectrum before it was found on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
