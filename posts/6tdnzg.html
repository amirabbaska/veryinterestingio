		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't even have to go back that far.  In the not that distant past (and in many parts of the world today) food was not that easily obtainable or as calorically dense.  Sure, you're going to have one offs where someone with very high social status could be overweight, but that was the problem of the ancient 1%.  There was a reason Gout was known as the rich man's disease...because the condition could be brought on by overindulging in meat, alcohol, and being overweight.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we were hunter gatherers we had a very diverse diet. Food was not plentiful though so we have an evolutionary trait of gorging on high calorie foods because it could be a while before we saw it again (eg certain berries). We burned a lot of calories from hunting and gathering too. Then the agriculture revolution took place around 10000bc which made food more predictable, but less diverse which is where the problem started. Living entirely on rice in Asia, wheat and corn in other parts of the world probably meant some would get a bit fat but not receive all nutrients. Famine was also more likely if you rely on one crop. Today we still have a high calorie urge but it's too easy to get those calories and not burn it off. In short, I think there were a few obese people long ago (think about how you still get some fat Asians who only live on rice) but not nearly as prolific as today.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most humans were lean up until 200 years ago. Prior to that point in time food supplies were alway precarious and famines were common. It was not until modern agricultural innovations happened that we were able to have stable enough food supplies to have enough extra food for a sizable portion of the population to be obese. Now you have likely always had some obese among the leaders of any given group, but most were lean. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans who are hunter-gatherers are NOT all lean and fast...they need to be reasonably fit, but most hunting (unless on the African savanna, where one may need to run down sprinting animals using a strategy of persistent slower chasing) does not require speed but intelligence, communication, and tool-making skills. Also, people get lean only during starvation - most hunter-gatherers have  normal BMI and spend only 3-4 hours a day on obtaining food, and their metabolic rate is similar to that of any modern-living human (the difference in obesity rates in modern human is due to caloric excess, not due to decreased expenditure).  If you look at images of tribal/native people in jungles etc, they are not either too skinny or too fat eg. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/uncontacted-tribe-amazon-brazil-photos/" target="_blank">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/uncontacted-tribe-amazon-brazil-photos/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there may have been some that earned respect enough that they were brought food and didn't need to hunt, but for most, getting obese would prevent them from being effective hunters.  Human's greatest asset is their stamina.  Ancient humans often hunted by chasing the prey until it either was so tired it collapsed and was easy for humans to kill, or the animal ran until it died.  When you are a creature whose life exists around long distance running, being obese doesn't fit well.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
