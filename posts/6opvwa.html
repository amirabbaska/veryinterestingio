		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the simplest of terms, photons are more prone to bounce off a surface as the angle the impact decreases. Think about throwing a ball at a window, if you hit it straight on, it has a good chance of penetrating the window. If you hit the window with a glancing blow, the ball is more prone to bounce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some partial good answers here. It has to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations" target="_blank">Fresnel equations</a> as mentioned, but what's important when you're viewing, for example, the reflection of the Sun in water, is that as the angle becomes smaller, the amount of the light that is reflected goes up non-linearly and approaches 100%. This causes the characteristic glimmering of water and other objects. It can even cause &quot;black&quot; objects, that when viewed under a high angle and intense light still appear &quot;black&quot;, to suddenly appear bright white when the Sun's (or any other strong, white light-source) light is reflected (near-)perfectly. </p>
<p>Some materials even have significant angles under which light will reflect <strong>100%</strong>, which is known as Total Internal Reflection. The angle under which this occurs is largely dependent on the refractive index of the material and the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. For most materials this means <em>higher</em> wavelengths require <em>smaller</em> angles. This isn't possible with nearly every material and wavelength, and the equations are rather hard with lots of complex numbers, but with certain materials and wavelengths, 100% reflection is possible (excluding the evanescent part, which is extremely small).</p>
<p>In daily life you won't notice the difference between an object reflecting 50% or 99% or 100% of the Sun's light though! Either of those will make the object shine bright enough to physically hurt your eyes when you look into it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When light hits a surface, part of it gets reflected, and part gets absorbed. In transparent media, the light that enters the transparent medium doesn't continue straight on, but is refracted. When the angle of reflection becomes smaller, more light gets reflected instead of absorbed, meaning the reflection becomes more clear. Look-up refraction on Wikipedia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technical term is fresnel (freh-nel). The reason we see anything is because light bounces off of stuff. The more of a glancing angle that light bounces off and hits your eye, the more mirror like it looks. Smoother objects do this better than rough objects because more light can bounce off of it into your eye. Even dirt has fresnel but it is such a rough material you really have to look for it to see it at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
