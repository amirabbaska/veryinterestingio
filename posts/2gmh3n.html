		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 Answer: Headache can come from two main sources, inside your skull, or outside your skull. Most of your brain does not have pain sensors on it. Most headaches can be isolated to blood vessel sources or chemical imbalance <em>in the brain</em></p>
<p>ELI25 Answer:</p>
<p>Headache is actually caused by traction, displacement, inflammation, vascular spasm (blood vessel constriction), or distention of <em>pain sensitive structures</em> in the head of neck listed below. </p>
<p><strong>Isolated involvement of the boney skull, most of the dura (one of the meninges layers - a layer that covers the brain), or most regions of brain parenchyma (actual brain tissue!!) does NOT produce pain</strong></p>
<p>These are <em>pain-sensitive structures</em></p>
<p><strong>Within the Cranial Vault (within the skull where your brain is housed)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>venous sinuses (e.g., sagittal sinus)</li>
<li>anterior and middle meningeal arteries</li>
<li>dura at the base of the skull</li>
<li>trigeminal nerve (Cranial Nerve #5)</li>
<li>glossopharnygeal nerve (CN #9)</li>
<li>vagus nerve (CN #10)</li>
<li>proximal portions of the internal carotid artery and its branches near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Willis" target="_blank">circle of Willis</a></li>
<li>brainstem periaqueductal gray matter</li>
<li>sensory nuclei of the thalamus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extra-cranial sources (outside of where your brain is housed, but still in and/or on the skull)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>periosteum of the skull (basically the bone)</li>
<li>skin (duh!)</li>
<li>subcutaneous tissues</li>
<li>muscles </li>
<li>arteries</li>
<li>neck muscles</li>
<li>second and third cervical nerves</li>
<li>eyes</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the meninges which is basically tissue that wraps around the outside of the brain.  Some of it does dive into crevices in the brain tissue itself allowing it to feel like the pain is deeper inside your head.  The meninges is the only part of the brain that has nociceptive [pain] fibers.  The brain itself does not send any pain signals.  There are many things that can cause your meninges to be irritated.</p>
<p>Edit - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/YouWhiteYouBenAfflec" target="_blank">u/youwhiteyoubenafflec</a> pointed out that blood vessels and cranial nerves, if stimulated correctly, can cause pain.  This is true.  In fact the prevailing theory for the cause of migraines is the &quot;neurovascular theory,&quot; which posits that the cause of a migraine headache pain is of a vascular etiology.  There are 150 diagnostic categories of headache so the causes are diverse and numerous.  The most common type is a tension headache which is basically caused by tight muscles which put pressure on nerves in the neck which supply innervation to parts of the meninges.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple explanation that they gave us in nursing school is that you have a limited amount of space in your cranial vault, just enough for brain, cranium, blood, CSF, and whatever else is in there. If any of these things increase, you get a headache because there is no room for that. When blood vessels in your head vasodilate, for whatever reason, more blood is in your cranial vault. One of the best things to do is to vasoconstrict those blood vessels that are dilated. You can do this very easily and effectively with ice. I get frequent headaches and I am sometimes able to get rid of them with only an ice pack and no medication at all. Even other nurses I know have never heard of using ice, but I swear it works. Especially when I was pregnant, because I couldn't take Ibuprofen and Tylenol doesn't work, I used ice packs for headaches all the time. Hey, it is worth a try if your head is banging out of control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the types of headache. Anything which will set off your pain nerves for whatever reason.</p>
<p>If your just a little stressed or you tweak your neck, muscle which wrap around your head can squeeze blood vessels around your head which builds up pressure and or affects nerves which can cause pain. Usually dull and poorly localised around temples or occipital.</p>
<p>If someone smashes your head with a shovel it can actually cause your brain to bleed which when the blood clots will put pressure on the lining of the brain and cause pain. Sharp pain, localised and they do the light shine in your eyes thing.</p>
<p>If you got high blood presure. Can be local pain at top of head. Pain can vary.</p>
<p>If you got a sinus problem it can build up pressure and you get a dull frontal headache because of the snot causing pressure again.</p>
<p>Migraine syndrome - pretty bad pain on one side of the head often with a visual disturbance before or during.</p>
<p>Fluid imballance - pressure changes can cause pain wether it be too much fluid in the case of edema or not enough because your dehydrated or both because your kidneys/liver are fucked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
