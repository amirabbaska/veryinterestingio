		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bailout of 2008 was premised on the notion of Keynesian economic theory, which basically means that economic cycles can last longer than human lifetimes hence government intervention into capitalist systems are necessary in the &quot;short term&quot;. </p>
<p>At first, the administration toyed with the idea of allowing the banks to fail, then letting the system repair itself. That's why Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers weren't bailed out at first. It's important to recognize that shareholders were screwed anyway; in a bailout you basically dilute all your equity. So a bailout was less of a handout than a genuine rescue of the economic system. </p>
<p>However, the intertwining relationships between banks and major financial &quot;too big to fail&quot; entities like Fannie Mae or AIG meant that allowing one bank to fail would mean a cascading domino effect across the board. The way it works is like this. Many banks work essentially by taking short term debt (deposits, money instruments, etc) and investing it into longer term debt (mortgages, bonds, etc). Loss of confidence would spark a liquidity crisis much like a global bank run on US financial entities; and with many banks reliant on each other to pay back their loans, one big default could mean everyone would fall like dominos. This was because their assets were marked to market; in layman's terms, they were worth whatever the bond market thought they were worth, so overnight they could become &quot;worthless&quot; and therefore bankrupt, even if nothing had changed in one day. (fundamentally, they were supposed to be bankrupt in an orderly fashion a long time ago)</p>
<p>Hence the immediate bailout response (TARP) was more of a liquidity measure rather than a fundamental rescue (there was nothing to rescue anyway) to give confidence to the international pension fund and institutional money managers, so they didn't do a &quot;bank run&quot; on the US economy. This allowed for a slower, more controlled release of the pent up financial panic, and gave some breathing room for the government to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>The next order of bailouts that the general public is more familiar with, Quantitative Easing, is basically the same thing but on a much grander scale. Essentially, nations themselves can become over leveraged with debt, although in a slightly different meaning as they also can print money. But the basic idea was that the US economy as a whole had far more credit in the system than was represented by the productivity of its population - which means some lenders had been suckered and weren't getting their money back. </p>
<p>In order to &quot;deleverage&quot; the economy as a whole, you had to remove the debt in the system. This was done by buying up toxic assets from aforementioned financial entities and retiring them, using printed money since the government unlike most financial entities can print money. Governments have a host of options available to them that goes beyond the scope of this topic, but generally speaking the idea is the same. Remove debt so that the amount of credit in the system more closely matches actual productivity.</p>
<p>As there is just way too much debt accumulated over decades (started since around the 80's), there is no easy solution. Going against the Keynesian model and doing things the traditional way by letting the economy fail and correct itself had actually been done before - following the Great Depression of 1929. This had disastrous results for everyone, sparking mass suicides and social unrest, and the economy languished for over a decade and would have continued to do so for who knows how long had it not been for massive war spending. As Keynes himself put it, &quot;in the long term, we're all dead anyway.&quot; This formed the basis for the bailouts, justified by the premise that it was the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>To the common man on the street, the main thing you should be taking away from this is that the bailouts were necessary, but things aren't going to get much better soon. Adjust your expectations lower, as this will be the new normal going forward, at least for 10 years or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economy goes down, banks lose a lot of money. People get scared that the banks will collapse and withdraw their money, so the bank now has even less money, which can make more people scared, etc.</p>
<p>This can spiral out of control, leading to banks actually collapsing, meaning anybody who didn't already withdraw all their money just lost it.  <del>This is how the Great Depression started</del> This was one of the major contributors to the Great Depression. There are now government program in place to prevent this from getting as bad as the Depression was, but it still ends up with the economy being totally fucked up.</p>
<p>Or we can just bail out the banks at the beginning and prevent things from getting to that point in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will add with the idea of the consequences of them doing so. Bailing out the banks cemented in the minds Wall Street execs that the government will always bail, at least most of them, out given the right circumstance. This is called &quot;Moral Hazard&quot; where banks are incentivized to engage in risky behavior that is likely to lead to further fraud and risky behavior. Are the consequences disastrously bad if we did not bail them out? Yes, but they are also not very good for doing so. </p>
<p>I will also bring in the ideas of Hyman Minsky. One of his overarching claims is that stability is destabilizing. The government has worked to create stability for decades now in the form of safety nets for the unemployed and failing businesses. It is this stability and appearance of safety that specifically leads businesses to engage in risky behavior. If nothing is planned to go wrong and you wont be punished for what you do, why not keep pushing the line a little bit further?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give a brief idea: too many banks would fail, Govs wouldn't be able to pay the guaranteed deposits to virtually every member of their economy and also deal with the collapse in trade from the absence of the payment systems and money dealers.  Also, all the publically traded business or investors who would lose all their investments from the collapse of the equity markets.</p>
<p>Plus mass unemployment, not just from the banks themselves but also all other businesses going bankrupt.  Also the inevitable collapse in the currencies.</p>
<p>Essentially, if a too big too fail bank goes under its macro-prudentially significant enough to bring down the others banks and in turn pretty much the entire economy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because for many countries (most developed ones) the banking system is literally the lifeblood of economies, and allowing even one to collapse would, like comments above have said, cause a knock on effect on not just other banks closing down but sharheolders, people saving money in the banks, companies domestically abroad, you name it they're effected. Basically, total economic ruin, it was totally justified. </p>
<p>In the long run countries like the UK have actually made the vast majority of money back that they loaned money through selling the banks they nationalised back to pension funds and shareholders </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
