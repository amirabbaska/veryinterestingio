		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason juice companies use concentrate is so that they can keep their juice tasting similar throughout the season, despite different types of oranges being harvested from different countries even. By mixing the concentrates, it gives a uniform blend to their juice throughout the year. For example, when the winter oranges are harvested, part of their juice is added to summer concentrate, and part of it is frozen or canned. Then during summer, vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For soaps and such, it just means it's more concentrated, as the name would imply. Dish soaps and laundry detergents are typically mostly just water. The water added makes it mix easier and measure out easier. It also makes it look like you're buying more of something on the shelf, so you think you're getting a better deal (12oz soap for $1 vs 24oz for $1).</p>
<p>Most of the top juice replys are somewhat wrong.  Juice (like orange juice) goes bad after not too long, even stored and refridgerated, and orange growing season is not steady all year. So science (florida university in the 1940's) figured out that  heat and pressure can remove most of the water and many other compounds/nutrients from the juice to store for much longer, and then add it back when they need to use it. This leaves it tasting not the same as fresh squeezed, though.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;not from concentrate&quot; juice isn't really much different.  Instead of freezing after removing water, they de-oxygenate it and store it as a liquid. This also strips much of the flavor and vitamins out of it, which are added back (usually added back from extractions of the orange peels. This is for concentrate and not from concentrate.) to it after being stored for up to a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concentrates of liquids like dish soap and juices take up less space on shelves, and in the case of dish soap it cleans better with a smaller amount when it's concentrated. As for juice, it's easier to get a taste you like if you start with concentrate, since you just keep adding water until it tastes best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to believe it's more about economics. If you can manufacture and ship  1 unit of product that the end user can turn into, say, 10 units simply by adding water, there's more money to be made by the  company, and money saved by the consumer. Water is cheap at the consumer end, but costly to package and ship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the product. Concentrate normally means they've taken water out of something to make it 'stronger'. </p>
<p>For cleaning products, I suspect it is marketing. The thinking with that would be we assume and associate concentrate with with being stronger, so a concentrate cleaning product must be X times better than a non concentrate product.</p>
<p>For juices, again it can be marketing. <strong>NB</strong>:Where I live, juice from a supermarket has no concentrate. If it did, it would be a fruit <em>drink</em>, not fruit <em>juice</em>. A fruit juice has 100% fruit juice, a fruit <em>drink</em> has some fruit juice (usually not much) + all these additives, sugar etc. In this context concentrate means they have taken some water out of the juice to make it stronger. They've then put some of this concentrate juice into the drink along with other things to make a new fruity drink. </p>
<p>Another possibility (common in fast food joints), concentrate means they've taken some water out, transported it and added water back in, all to cut down on transport costs. In McDonald's (again, at least where I live), they link the concentrated drink, whether it be Coke or juice, directly into the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib-ce2z5PSAhVHxrwKHck5CgYQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flist25.com%2F25-fast-food-restaurants%2F&amp;psig=AFQjCNFyehn3AI7bsVZ7B01YsVLxn5GDhw&amp;ust=1487300265781751" target="_blank">dispensers</a>. The dispenser also has a water hose and when pressed there is some ratio of water to concentrate that is supposed to come out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
