		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally, my time to shine. Dentist here. Dentistry for the most part developed as a skilled trade. The field has resisted attempts to integrate into medicine throughout its history.</p>
<p>Initially, dental training was spotty at best and it didn't take much for somebody to claim they were a dentist. For example, Paul Revere advertised his skills as a dentist in addition to his other trade as a silver smith. There were &quot;dentists&quot; in the 18th century that were self proclaimed but branched out into dentistry after receiving a medical education, but that was not the norm.</p>
<p>In the US, beginning in the 1840's, dentists began to lobby the state government (in Alabama of all places) to allow dentists to sit on the state medical board and license dentists to practice. This didn't really begin to be enforced with any regularity until the turn of the 20th century. </p>
<p>Many dentists that I know do not think that the two professions should merge (as in everyone goes to medical school and then make dentistry a residency program after getting your MD). The claim is that there's so much specialized knowledge in Dentistry that it would be a waste of time to spend years on rotations through the other hospital wards when you could be studying advanced periodontics or removable or whatever else.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that many dentists resist the change because of a fear in the reworking of the payment structure into one more similar to the HMO model that dominates general medicine. Right now HMO practice is big in dentistry but there's still plenty of PPO plans and cash paying patients that the compensation is good, and for the most part an insurance company isn't telling you how to practice. There's also quite a bit of territorial feelings when it comes to dentistry. Dentists tend not to like it when they feel their &quot;turf&quot; is threatened. For examples of that, just see the whole dental therapist debate. </p>
<p>Well this turned into a wall of text. So TL;DR: History, Ego, Fears of Rocking the boat, all work together to keep the two separate.   </p>
<p>EDIT: This Gold is a Christmas miracle! I took a little nap and woke up to an exploded inbox, I'm going to try and get to as many questions as possible, so bear with me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a dentist.  My wife is an ER physician.  We went to school for 4 years for dental and med school, respectively.</p>
<p>After this, I was able to practice dentistry but she needed another 3 years of residency (some do 5) to practice as an ER doc.</p>
<p>We both took anatomy in the same lab for a full year but most of our year focused intensely on head and neck with the rest of the body's main vessels, nerves, muscles, etc. while hers was detailed on the whole body with less focus on the head and neck than ourselves.</p>
<p>Our paths diverge from that course on.  As dentists we learn all general diseases, treatments, medicine and pathology in various courses.  We can converse in them and understand them and understand how they affect the mouth and the interconnection between them all.  </p>
<p>We prescribe medications, administer drugs (sedatives, nitrous, antibiotics, narcotics, etc.) and must be responsible for their effects and interactions with other diseases, illnesses, and drugs.</p>
<p>As dentists we have rigourous training in a multitude of areas: root canals, fillings, crowns, bridges, surgery, anesthesia, implants, pathology or mouth diseases, cancer, tumours, cysts, cosmetics, dentures, etc.  This requires labourious hours working on plastic teeth, extracted, teeth, humans, and lots of textbooks.  Because of all these disciplines, we jump into them right from year one with medicine learned in less detailed treatment, assessment, and diagnosis on the side - but we are responsible for what we do to our patients with various medical conditions or ailments.</p>
<p>Physicians require residency to hone their area of expertise since their general medical degree just covered the basics of ALL medicine from delivering babies, to surgery, to diagnosing and treating all ailments of the body in much more rigourous detail than us dentists.  Residency gets down to specialty and sub-specialty in these areas.</p>
<p>What dentists do in practical physical work with our drill is the bulk of our 4 years beyond the textbooks.  We can specialize in order to excel and focus on one given area of dentistry.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>TL;DR  Working with your hands requires a lot of practice.  This is a huge component of dental school and we learn just enough medicine to not kill people with the drugs we prescribe or treatment we perform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't go to medical school. They go to dental school. Other medical doctors all go to medical school and branch out after they graduate. Dentists go to a completely separate school.<br />
Historically, dentistry was first done by barbers. I don't know why. All they did was pull infected/painful teeth. They were not considered healers, just tradesmen.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a dental student as a forewarning. You've posed a question that can't be clearly answered because no one dentist has made the decision to remain independent from physicians. You can look to the information on the history of the two professions as a starting point. MD's also tend to look down on us a little, which I don't understand. We're a different profession. They always say, &quot;you aren't real doctors,&quot; to which I reply &quot;I'm not a physician, no.&quot;</p>
<p>I will say, however, that I dread the day that dentistry is absorbed into medicine. Personally, I am much more judicious with the care that I give my patients in the clinic knowing that they are paying out of pocket. If everyone had a coverall insurance, even if it was unintentional, I would probably over-diagnose and render unnecessary treatment at a much higher rate. For this reason, I think broader insurance coverage for dental might actually make it more costly for patients, especially in the long run. I see how little time physicians spend with patients and how many tests they prescribe, and I'm just glad I'm in my field.</p>
<p>When you pay out of pocket, you're the boss, when the insurance companies pay, they're the boss. It's not how I want to practice and it's not how I want my patients' oral health to be dictated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Undergraduate pre-dental and pre-medical tracts are more or less identical..Lots of biology, chemistry etc.  Dental and Medical schools are obviously different.  Generally, the first two years of dental and medical school are rather similar.  The last two years of dental school starts to center more around head/neck anatomy, the oral cavity, and clinical procedures.  Source: went to and graduated from dental school. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
