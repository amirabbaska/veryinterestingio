		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Higher frequencies can use physically smaller and cheaper transformers; so 60 Hz would be preferred over 50.</p>
<p>Lower frequencies are less affected by skin effect; so 50 Hz is best here.  Skin effect is where the AC current flows only on the outside portion of larger diameter wires, in effect increasing resistive losses in transmission lines.</p>
<p>The flicker of fluorescent lighting is more visible at 50 Hz, although this was probably not a consideration when the frequency standards were developed.</p>
<p>The frequency also affects the speed of AC motors and generators.  This is not an advantage so much as a design consideration.</p>
<p><del>Unrelated factoid:  The subways of New York used 25 Hz not that long ago; maybe they still do.</del>  Edit: u/millijuna is correct.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I may as well chime in.</p>
<p>There's a fascinating <em>indirect</em> advantage to having the 50Hz standard.  It's increasingly moot today, but was pretty relevant up to and including DVD's prime.  And that would be how the two standards affected their corresponding TV broadcast specifications.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, suffice it to say that 50Hz provided two advantages.  First, 50Hz is much more agreeably compatible with the film standard of 24fps.  All you need to do is speed the film up a little bit and you get a flat 2:1 ratio.  This meant that when movies were broadcast to PAL TVs, they did not suffer from the rather bad juddering you would always get when the same was broadcast over NTSC.  The change in audio pitch is far more subtle than the change in smoothness of motion.  In the modern era, DVDs mastered with this speed increase can nonetheless be made to play back at 24fps, with a corresponding correction to the frequency of the audio.</p>
<p>Second, the lower framerate of PAL meant that a higher resolution could be devoted to each frame.  About <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL#PAL_vs._NTSC" target="_blank">20% higher</a>.</p>
<p>Again, with the advent of HD, these are largely moot considerations, but it does still mean, for example, that if you find a given movie or TV show is still only available on DVD (and that probably still applies to most things), the PAL iteration continues to offer the best picture, thanks to 50Hz electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They were both used before there was any sort of standard, and both function well enough to not be worth the <em>MASSIVE</em> cost of switching over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, the wrong frequency can damage certian appliances (especially older ones, many new electronics are built to function worldwide). For people who use portable generators <del>dying</del> during power outages, having a generator turning at the wrong speed can damage expensive appliances. </p>
<p>A motorized clock with a second hand is a great tool for verifying proper speed of a portable generator.   </p>
<p>Using a battery powered stopwatch, you can see if it takes more or less than 60 seconds for the clock's second hand to make a complete revolution and adjust the engine speed govenor appropriately.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
