I was looking into Solar Sails, and how they use light to push off the sail, but if light carries a Force from momentum, shouldn't a flashlight be able to propel itself without any solar Sails?</p></div></div>

In order to effectively harness that momentum the object needs to be extremely light-weight and the stream of light propelling it needs to be extremely strong. (think megawatt lasers or light from a star)<br />
A good historical example of radiation pressure (the formal name what you're proposing with a flashlight) is the <a href="https://www.space.com/16648-pioneer-anomaly-spacecraft-mystery-solved.html" target="_blank">Pioneer anomaly</a> where the spacecraft was slowly pushed off course due to uneven radiation of heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, the momentum of the light is very small in comparison to the mass of the flashlight.  Sure, a flashlight would propel itself across outer space, it's just a lot slower than other things of that mass.</p>
<p>Solar Sails have to be very, very large and very, very light.  Such things can be built in space.  Then you can make them go with a massive laser on the ground, or a star.  Both of those power sources are much too massive to take with you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your mass is far too high for the proportionally tiny force of your farts.  Probably.  I don't really know you.</p>
<p>The light coming from a flashlight is far too small (orders of magnitude too small) to propel a flashlight forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Photons have energy, or are energy depending on how you think of light.  They have momentum, and that is transferred to objects like solar sails.  A quick search for &quot;radiation pressure&quot; can give more details on the topic.</p>
<p>A flashlight would have some force in space and would accelerate due to the beam.  The force of the flashlight from emitting the beam would be small, but it is greater than zero. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have some good explanations of your main question.</p>
<p>I'd like to just make a little note about the wording of your question.</p>
<p>Forces exist only as the interaction between two objects. An object cannot therefore &quot;have&quot; or &quot;carry&quot; force. Inertia and momentum are things we can consider an object to &quot;have&quot; that are sometimes meant when people say &quot;the force of&quot; an object. </p>
<p>I like to keep this straight by always referring to a force as &quot;The force object A exerts on Object B&quot;, so it's really clear which two objects I am saying are pushing or pulling on one another. For example, my weight is a result of the force Earth exerts on my body. A car skidding to a stop is a result of the force the road exerts on the car's tires.</p>
<p>Thinking of it this way can help us not get tricked into thinking a force exists when it does not or confuse force for another thing that might be involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
