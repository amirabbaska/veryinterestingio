		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back then people could afford all the modern luxuries like clothes dryers and air conditioning and tvs and telephones - the only expenses we've gained are computers and the internet but those aren't that expensive.  In the 70's they were able to afford college education on a large scale on a 40hr per household basis - now we can't afford that education on the 80hrs per household basis.  Not to mention the vast improvements in production which should reduce the number of hours...</p>
<p>I get that women joining the workforce drove prices up but that still leaves extra money going somewhere and my question is where and I guess why?  We've essentially doubled the workforce and increased the production, I'm guessing by a few fold, so what's all this doing at the end of the day?  </p>
<p>The only answer I've been able to come up with is just increased profits for companies and thus their stakeholders but maybe I'm wrong and overlooking something - maybe there is another explanation?  Maybe it has something to do with globalization and having to pay third world country workers more?  Although it seems that that too went down because more things used to be produced in the first world countries i.e. for higher wages.  I would really like an honest unbiased answer because I feel I myself am biased (just a little ;) )</p>
<p>Also, in case someone has the urge to say that it's because women want to work and won't go back to being housewives - well the obvious solution should have been/be to decrease the number of hours for the two working people, splitting it 20hrs each, decreasing daycare costs etc WITHOUT necessarily the companies hiring double the people to make up for lost profit so they could argue the increased benefit costs against this - there shouldn't be any lost profit because 40hrs per man used to be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A lot of you are saying inflation - and some have even explained inflation - thank you - but doesn't inflation only beg the question?  Prices started going up because people started earning more (double - because of the extra 40hrs a week) - that seems reasonable enough.  But at the end of the day the amount of work produced first doubled (or went up by a third since not all women entered or were as qualified at the time) and second went by a factor of X due to production improvements.  <strong>So where is all this extra work going?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EDIT No. 2:</strong>  I'm going to address some issues/comments/answers that have come up</p>
<p>First, women entering the workforce as either bad or good.  It's common conservative rhetoric that this was a bad thing because now two people must work to earn the same as one person in the past as prices for things .  Children are without mothers, daycare costs, no home cooked meals etc etc.  Then the liberal rhetoric that women entering the workforce has been just swell for everybody and that working for a women is liberating etc etc.  Well this is a false dichotomy because there is a good third option: let 20 hrs be the full time standard per week.  This way mothers wouldn't be overworked but neither would the fathers who would be able to continue participating in their children's lives.  Men aren't work machines who exist to provide money for families - men are entitled to free time (in which they could take up hobbies, think, create and perhaps create jobs and move the economy along.  Women on the other hand are entitled to pursue things outside the home.  It can be very fulfilling to earn money and succeed at one's career.  Women also would benefit from having some spare time for their hobbies, to think, and create.  So no, it's not a liberal vs conservative issue.  We're lucky that we're at a point that we have machines assist us with work so that we can sit back and relax....</p>
<p>Second, people don't take out student loans because they frivolously want an edumacation to feel good about themselves.  People often take out loans to get an education to better themselves and increase their job prospects.  A lot of jobs require post secondary education nowadays.  Not everyone is cut out for the trades - especially among women.  We have beauty school and culinary school, both of which we have to compete with men.  Most women aren't cut out to be plumbers and carpenters, so how else can they earn a decent wage i.e. not minimum wage then by going to school?  There are few others that I haven't mentioned but education increases one's chances greatly!</p>
<p>Third, housing, car and education costs seem to be significant recipients of the extra 40 hrs per week...</p>
<p>per /u/NotReallyAGenie</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost of average car in 1950? $3,216 ... $31,000 in 2013 dollars. Average cost of a car in 2015? $28,000. If we're buying two cars, we're spending 80% more to do so.
Don't forget the cost of houses. $14,500 in 1950 ($140,000 in 2013 dollars) and today's average house and $242,000. Why? The average size of the house has nearly doubled.
College is practically mandatory education today, and was rarely attended by most people in 1950. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>AND from /u/ajswdf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Car in 1960 (inflation adjusted): $21k
Car in 2013: $31k
House in 1960 (inflation adjusted): $102k
House today: $290k
Those are the two largest expenses for most people. As you can see, people spend significantly more on both, particularly housing, than they did in the 1960's.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That one has to be partly our fault...there seems to be no reason to spend that much on loans, because very few of us are paying cash up front for cars and houses.  A lot of people have said, and I agree, that we are encouraged to do this and I believe that. It's also true that since we are forced to work 80 hours per week per household, once we pay off student loans and we finally have extra income what else can we do to make ourselves happier?  Buy more because we can't get more time off...So I definitely understand</p>
<p>Thirdly, the extra &quot;stuffs&quot; argument.  Outside of the three above depositories of our extra labor (college, McHummers and McMansions and sometimes perhaps McDegrees) there isn't that much stuff we are buying.</p>
<p>again, per /u/NotReallyAGenie</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average television in 1950 cost $2,000 in today's money. Today a 32&quot; television is $450.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even less.  Netflix or Sling tv or no tv are pretty cheap as well.  Internet and computers are the only new costs but how much of the 40 hrs extra that we work can they possibly account for?  Landlines of the 1950 probably equal cell phones nowadays.  Appliances are way more energy efficient so that helps offset the difference....these seem to be mere pennies on the dollar we're talking about (in difference between the 1950's and now).  </p>
<p>Dining might account for some of the wasted money...but again, I don't think it's significant enough to account for the extra labor.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the 40 hours per week per household?  Like the majority of you have said, and I am left in agreement with:  the fruits of the extra 40 hrs per week that we work is pocketed by the 1% who continue to grow in wealth exponentially.  They are reaping the rewards of all the advances in production, third world slave labor, and increases in production due to essentially free 40 hrs of work per week per household - that part is our donation to them.  This of course does nothing to propel our economy forward because well, there are far fewer jets to be bought by the 1% then tvs by the masses to boost the economy. The portion of the 40 hrs per week that we spend on cars and houses and ridiculous tuition prices seems to be encouraged by the 1% as well...in order to keep this monstrosity going...but that one seems to be more in people's control.</p>
<p>These are just some conclusions I've come to thanks to the replies.  I am still open to counter arguments of course.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3: Let me clarify the question Prior to the 1980s but post Great Depression 40 hrs per week produced -&gt; enough to sustain a household, now, post 1980s we have doubled the hrs of production but we continue to have only enough to sustain a household.  The hours that work is produced doubled, so must have the work produced (we're not taking about nonprofits and charities, we're talking about for profit companies who get a value from each and every employee otherwise they wouldn't hire double the people) so where is the profit from this extra labor going?</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the points about us all having more stuff are completely off base.  </p>
<p>I am 30.  I have $250K in student loans (Patent Attorney w/ Masters in Biotech).  I make $50k/year.  That's right, the least paid chump in my field.  My wife is about to have a baby (three weeks) and is a self employed florist.  Hence, she does not work.  We live in the cheapest apartment we can afford.  It includes free internet.  We have no cable.  We could only afford to buy one car.  While its more expensive in the long run, I currently lease a vehicle as we could not afford the payments of a financed vehicle.  We eat rice and beans nearly every meal...literally.  We do NOT have a lot of possession, because we do NOT have any square feet in our apartment to put them.</p>
<p>This is NOT a &quot;middle class have done it to themselves by buying too much stuff&quot; problem.  This is a problem created solely by the greed of employers and their shareholders, which is enabled by our oligarchical regime. </p>
<p>For Todd's sake, we are one of only 4 countries that does not guarantee any form of paid maternal or paternal leave.  WTF?</p>
<p>I would gladly trade places in time with anyone before the 1980's.  I would forsake my smartphones and shit in the woods for the rest of my life if I could escape these student loans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you also have to realize that Union jobs have decreased immensely, on top of &quot;Globalization&quot; (How to fuck workers over by going to 2nd and 3rd world countries for cheap labor) of many jobs. There are fewer jobs per capita than there was in the 70s. And then you have to look at things like H1B1 visas and the sort.</p>
<p>Also, corporate and commercial culture changed as well where paying workers good wages became a liability and not a respected duty (See &quot;Ford's Five Dollars A Day Wage&quot;). </p>
<p>The real issue, and the easiest one to resolve, is to have workers get involved in creating jobs again and not merely relying on the rich to create jobs. Because the rich like to fuck people for the most gain when it comes to employing people. I know this because I work with rich people as their legal war dog (used to say Pitbull but I like Pitbulls too much to keep saying that). Many of the rich people I know bitch about not being able to get good employees for shit wages but they'll keep hiring scum for shitty wages because it fits their bottom line. </p>
<p>If you want things to start getting better for working class people than working class people have to organize and start creating businesses that suit their purposes as consumer and laborers. I have ideas but most people are too lazy, stupid, and small to pull it off. </p>
<p>Basically, the working classes like getting fucked and say &quot;thank you&quot; when the rich go in dry and rough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other arguments about inflation and wages not keeping up, think about how much more <em>stuff</em> the average household spends its money on. </p>
<p>Compare what we consider a middle class standard of living with 50 years ago. Cell phones are more expensive than landlines, we have personal computers and Internet bills, generally speaking more than one television, and so on. The cost to power all of the devices in our homes is higher, and it's less common for a family to get by with one car. </p>
<p>A lot of these things are only marginally more expensive, but it adds up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women didn't join the workforce because they wanted to work minimum wage jobs at the mall. They joined because in the 1970s and 80s, wages were already unable to afford the standard of living of the 50s and 60s, and to maintain that standard of living, people had to take out credit cards, send housewives to work, or both </p>
<p>Seriously, people believe women would rather work at crappy Walmart for crap wages than stay home raising their beautiful children? Maybe lawyers and doctors want to work and love their careers, but that chick behind the counter at the gas station? She's only there because her husband doesn't earn enough to support them both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a hunch it is due to two or three main factors.</p>
<p>(1) Income distribution is a lot more uneven than in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Essentially fewer and fewer people take a larger and larger share of the wealth, to a degree it is threatening the existence of the US middle class as a financially secure demographic.</p>
<p>(2) A larger and larger part of the workforce and working time is &quot;non-productive&quot;, i.e. produces a work output that is not useful to anyone else. Thus, the amount of goods and services produced is less, contributing to inflation, outscoring and simply less goods and services to go around. The most blatant (but far from only) example of this is the US health insurance industry. For each dollar spent towards health care through the insurance system, only a fraction goes to the useful output of actual nurses, doctors and supplies. The rest goes to feeding the paper mill of people pushing claims around and distributing costs and profits (most of which do not end up in the middle class but with stock owners -see point 1 above.)</p>
<p>(3) [Other macroeconomic causes like the massive foreign debt the US has accrued through wars etc]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
