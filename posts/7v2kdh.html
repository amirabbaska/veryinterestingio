Chemical cauterization does this as well. So yes, it helps by actually doing controlled damage to tissues and vessels and makes them more susceptable to infection. However, when done in an emergency situation, it is better to save the patient from immediate bleed out and deal with infections later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>For small vessels (for example, the blood vessels that could be near exposure in the nostrils/sinuses), sufficient cauterization can prevent it and the surrounding tissue from healing in such a way that it is easily exposed again. This varies depending on the individual, however.</p>
<p>Cautery in the case of a near-exposed blood vessel is different than cauterizing abnormally exposed vessels (ie. due to an injury). The former is generally very mild and is done to help build scar tissue where the vessel was orginally close to being exposed. The latter is a more immediate response to prevent further blood loss and is more aggressive.</p>
<p>source: personally have had 7 chemical cauterizations and a final procedure involving electrode cautery to solve my own nosebleeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short:</p>
<p>Cauterisation is basically the melting of flesh (and blood vessels) together to prevent any excessive bleeding.  It's basically like welding a metal object or moulding 2 pieces of clay together.</p>
<p>In your friend's case, s/he might have haemophilia. Anyways, cauterisation is only used when artificial hemostasis fails: so if it keeps bleeding even though she's been given pills/meds, or if she's been applying pressure for a crap ton of time, you'll probably need to be cauterised.</p>
<p>Once the blood vessels are melted together, the wound will be sealed by the melted bits, so bleeding will stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

But if you were to melt some of the bottle around the puncture, it would seal up the hole. That's exactly what cauterization does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
