		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've thought about this a bit since my undergrad days; I have an advanced degree in math but never went beyond basic physics.</p>
<p>My thinking is this: The relative passage of time for an individual is dependent on its velocity, correct? So the relative speed of the passage of time here on earth is dependent on the planet's velocity around the sun, the solar system's velocity through the galaxy, the movement of the galaxy through the universe, and probably other stuff. All of these factor into the velocity at which we, as individuals, are moving through the universe and hence the speed at which we experience the passage of time.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that all of those factors (the planet's velocity around its star, the system's movement through the galaxy, etc.) would vary widely across the universe. And, since that is the case, an individual standing on the surface of a planet somewhere else in the galaxy would, relative to an observer on Earth at least, experience  time passing at a much different rate than we do here on Earth.</p>
<p>How different would it be, though? How much different would the factors I listed (motion of the galaxy, velocity of the planet's orbit, etc.) have to be in order for the relative time difference to be significant? Celestial velocities seem huge and I figure that even small variations could have significant effects, especially when compounded over millions of years.</p>
<p>So I guess that's it! Just something I've been thinking about off and on for several years, and I'm curious how accurate my thoughts on this topic are.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: More precise language. And here is an example to (I hope) illustrate what I'm trying to describe.</p>
<p>Say we had two identical stopwatches. At the same moment, we place one stopwatch on Earth and the other on a distant planet. Then we wait. We millions or billions years. If, after that time, someone standing next to the Earth stopwatch were able to see the stopwatch that had been placed on another planet, how much of a difference could there potentially be between the two?</p></div></div>
