		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start, you need to know what a blockchain is.   Basically, it is a ledger, a record of transactions.   Normally, this function is handled by a central authority, such as a bank.   You put money into the back, they write it down.   You spend it, they write that down.   If you try to spend it twice, they say no.</p>
<p>But central authorities provide a single point of failure, and require trust in that authority.   This is a weakness in many cases -- especially regarding regulatory uncertainty in many parts of the world.   But without a central authority, who will keep you from spending your money 5 times, or even know if you have any to begin with?</p>
<p>The answer is a mathematical and computing breakthrough called a blockchain.   The first successful one was called &quot;Bitcoin&quot;.   Basically, it replaces the central authority with some complicated math and majority rules and some interesting economics, so that the ledger is public and its state is determined by computers.</p>
<p>There are many blockchains, Bitcoin is just the most famous.   Bitcoin is suitable as a transfer of value and not much more (and increasingly unsuitable for that). </p>
<p>Ethereum took the ideas from the blockchain, and said, what if we attach a computer program to each  entry in the ledger?   So instead of &quot;address 123 has 400 coins&quot;, it could have a program that says &quot;Address 123 has 400 coins, and they will be released 5 coins per week to Address 155 and 175 on alternate weeks.&quot; </p>
<p>This program is now a contract: offline, a couple people agreed to this payment schedule, you write it into code and are guaranteed payment over time because the Ethereum network enforces it.</p>
<p>That's just scratching the surface, though.   What if you could attach any program or file or contract between any two people, and it is enforced automatically by the network, and nobody could shut it off?</p>
<p>Want to gamble but your country doesn't like it?  Too bad, they can't stop it. The blockchain cannot be shut down by a central authority.   Do you live in a third world country where property rights don't mean much, but you want to get investors in your business?   Put your business on the blockchain and they can give you money securely.</p>
<p>There are thousands of ideas of what to do with Ethereum, but it is very young and it is likely that its most valuable uses aren't even conceived yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethereum is like a globally shared spreadsheet (blockchain). Every 14 seconds (block time) everyone synchronizes their spreadsheet by adding any new rows (transactions) at the bottom (append-only transaction ledger). You get the spreadsheet kinda like how you can download a movie from Bittorent (decentralized network) and connecting to peers (nodes) hosting the file. </p>
<p>No one can cheat or make extra money (Ether / cryptocurrency) out of thin air, because the software (protocol) checks that you only spent money you got from someone else (cryptographic signatures ensure transactions are valid) or that you won it in the lottery (mining reward) every synchronization (block).</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Ethereum is that it's not just a spreadsheet like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3" target="_blank">Lotus 1-2-3</a> (bitcoin), but was built fully featured like Excel with VBA macros (SmartContracts).</p>
<p>Why all the fuss? Because it's the first time in human history that any 2 people (2-party) on opposite sides of the world can make a bet with eachother and they don't need a bookie (escrow / bank) to hold the funds (counterparty).  They can do it with this spreadsheet alone (trustless / no counterparty risk) by writing a macro to decide who wins the bet and gets the money (the macro [SmartContract] holds the money [Ether]). </p>
<p>How's that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A decentralized network is a collection of computers connected together over the internet that run some common program. An example of this would be bittorrent. Bittorrent enable anyone running a bittorrent client to share files directly with each other rather than downloading that file from a single computer. </p>
<p>Decentralized applications have the advantage that there is no single computer that can be turned off that would shut down the functionality of the entire thing.</p>
<p>In 2008 an anonymous person named Satoshi published a design for a distributed network that could be used to record a ledger. A ledger is a history book in this case a digital one. This network went live in 2009.</p>
<p>The main advantage a distributed ledger has is that there is no single point of failure. Just like bittorrent there is no single server you can shut down to disable it. Unlike bittorrent however it is important that a history book is the same for everyone who views it. This is not a problem for bittorrent because you are not adding to the files you share. You share a torrent file which contains the information that describes the files and if you want to make changes you have to create a new torrent file. But with a history book you are always adding to it and the order in which new information is added is important.</p>
<p>Another reason to distribute the history book is to prevent tampering. If everyone holds a copy of the history then one person changing the history will not show up in every one elses copy. </p>
<p>The way it works is that there are a set of rules that everyone's copy of the software follows when they receive a new message containing data to add to the history book. If information comes in that conflicts with those rules then it is simply ignored. </p>
<p>This is not enough though to make sure everyone gets the same copy of history because some people might get messages in a different order to others. For instance If a message is created in Australia and the USA at the same time then someone in Australia might get the message generated in Australia first and a person in the USA might get the message generated there first even though both messages are valid.</p>
<p>To solve this problem Satoshi designed bitcoin so that messages are grouped together in blocks and a sort of lottery is run on those blocks. People perform a mathematical function on the data in the block to generate a number and if that number fits a certain condition then the rules of the network say they should accept that block... well they should accept that block if it follows all of the rules and if it is the least likely winner out of all the known winners. The least likely winner being the last block of messages found on the longest chain of blocks.</p>
<p>The difficulty of this lottery is adjusted (again by the common set of rules) so that blocks of messages are accepted at a regular rate that allows them to spread through the network before a new block is found to fit the criteria.</p>
<p>Since performing the math function requires time and energy the cost of a ticket in this lottery cant be faked. Someone wanting to change history would need more computing power than every one on the network combined.</p>
<p>To resolve conflicts when 2 blocks are found at the same time you wait until the next block is found and accept the longest chain. Blocks of messages can only refer to a single previous block so the people playing the lotto are also betting on the previous block also being accepted all the way back to the first one.</p>
<p>Now this is where currency comes into it. Those messages that are being recorded are actually financial transactions of a new currency that only exists as messages in this history book. And the way this currency is created is as a reward for the lottery that makes the system work!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>^(copy-paste of a previous post of mine, original post linked)</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/623wyv/screw_eli5_how_do_i_explain_ethereum_to_my_mom/dfjphbd/?context=3" target="_blank"><em>^(here)</em></a></p>
<p>It's actually really simple. If she knows about Bitcoin, we explain using Bitcoin. If she doesn't, use a physical object for analogy instead, like an apple.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bitcoin is basically digital money - like cash. </p>
<p>We could have a <strong>simple transaction where I send you 1 bitcoin</strong> - now it's yours, and that's it. Just like cash, you now have it, and I don't.</p>
<p>Ethereum is basically programmable money. Instead of a simple Bitcoin transaction, we can now add programming logic to it. </p>
<p>Our <strong>transaction</strong> would be, say, <strong>I send you 1 ether <em>IF</em> the clock turns exactly 9:05PM</strong>. And if the network verifies that the condition is met (it actually is 9:05pm), then the transaction goes through and you'll receive your ether.</p>
<hr />
<p>And you can have any condition, as long as you can program it! How about I send you 1 ether <strong><em>IF</em></strong> this Reddit thread reaches 25 comments? How about I send you 1 ether <strong><em>IF</em></strong> Marine Le Pen becomes president of France? Programming logic opens up a massive world of opportunities and that's what makes Ethereum special.</p>
<p>This is how I explain Ethereum in person to people and I'm easily able to do so in minutes. Just adjust for your target audience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, Imma take a shot.  For a 5 year old, here we go. </p>
<p>People want to do stuff in the business realm like exchange money, have contracts, and know who owns what.    With physical money, exchanging it is easy, but you have to have someone issue the money and fight counterfeiters. For contracts, two people signing a paper often isn't enough, and you need to file it with the court and/or sue them in court if they break contract.   And some government clerk is in charge of keeping records of who owns what land. </p>
<p>All of that depends on &quot;authority&quot;.  Someone in control who governs how these things are handled, what's fair, and keeps people from screwing each other. </p>
<p>Ethereum (and blockchain tech in general) is software which uses encryption and distributed computing to remove the need for an authority. With a blockchain you can mathematically prove that someone else did a thing.  Like paid you $5, transferred ownership of a house, or agreed to a contract. And it's computationally so difficult to make a forgery that it's impossible.  You know, unless there's a software bug or something.  Which actually happened to Ethereum. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>More like a decentralized computer that people can trust to crunch numbers and do business over. And yes, you can help out and get paid in crypto-currency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
