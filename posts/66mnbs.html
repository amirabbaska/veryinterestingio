		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle contraction occur when electrical impulses trigger the release of chemicals (sodium and calcium, along with some other things) that react with the muscle fibres causing them to contract. The contraction ends when the chemical are cleared away stopping the reaction. A &quot;knot&quot; in a muscle is an area of muscle fibre that has remained contracted while the rest of the muscle has relaxed. By pressing on the knot for an extended period of time (technical term is digital ischemic pressure) the blood in the area is forced away. When you then lift off, fresh blood floods in and this helps to clear away the remaining chemicals that were still bound to the muscle fibres, allowing them to relax.</p>
<p>Edit: Looking through the comments there are 3 main ideas being thrown around, and I had addressed 2 of them in comments so I thought I should put the info here too.</p>
<p>Good news is, all 3 ideas are relevant. I provided the answer above As my primary response as it relates directly to the question of pushing into the muscle, but as a remedial therapist treating soft tissues, a combinations of techniques are needed for effective treatment. </p>
<p>Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organ is one of those treatments and is used mostly on long muscles, like calves and hamstrings, when tension is being felt along the length of the whole muscles as opposed to an isolated area of contraction &quot;knot&quot;. Most effective way of stimulating the Golgi organ is by bowing the tendon as this effectively makes it freak out thinking the tendon is about to snap, telling the muscle it has to relax so this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Adhesions are another issue where trauma to the muscle fibres over react while healing causing them to become stuck to the fascia  (muscle casing), this results in the muscles not being able to move smoothly and will cause disfunction of movements. This is commonly treated with friction as it helps to tear apart the adhesions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle fibers run in all different directions in our body and muscles are layered on top of each other from our heads to our toes. This is a good thing and the reason why we can bend, twist, dance, and play sports. Our muscles are meant to be pliable, strong, and challenged. However, when we sit at a computer all day in the same position and if we injure ourselves, or if we are chronically dehydrated, we can lose our mobility and flexibility. The various muscle fibers start to stick to each other and become adhered. This new hard and lumpy feeling is a muscle ‘knot’. Pressing on the knots breaks those bunched up muscle fibers apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ONLY correct answer is we don't know. We don't even know if knots are a thing. We barely understand muscular contraction as it is not observable. Our best guess is still the sliding filament theory. I could put 10 physical therapists in a room and 5 of them will say knots are a thing, 5 will say that they don't exist. Of those 5 PT's each one will have a different opinion of what causes knots. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Massage makes muscles relax by tightening them first, strangely enough. Muscles have a finite scale, call it 1-10. 1 is perfectly relaxed and 10 is a cramp. After a long day maybe your neck feels like an 8. When you press on the muscle it's actually a stressor so the muscle tightens further. But if you press long enough it gets to a 10 at the top of its scale and resets back to a 1.
Long term &quot;knots&quot; in your muscles are usually  fascial constrictions and are called adhesions. It's a lot like internal scar tissue. You can lift and twist or grind those clumps of internal scar until they break apart. That allows your muscle to move freely again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
