<p>Fidgeting is a response to anxiety or boredom. Anxious fidgeting occurs because the body has elevated levels of stress hormones, which are prepping your muscles for sudden exertion. If you don’t have any tigers to run away from at that moment, all that energy has nowhere to go and jiggling your leg or biting your nails is a way to partially relieve that.</p>
<p>Research at the University of Hertfordshire in 2005 found that fidgeting improved performance in memory tests and this might be because it lowers the level of cortisol, a stress hormone that interferes with learning. Boredom fidgeting such as drumming your fingers or pen spinning gives your brain something to focus on. This is soothing and reduces the amount of other, less directed, fidgeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/why-do-we-fidget" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some researchers have proposed that fidgeting is not only an indicator of diminishing attention, but is also a subconscious attempt to increase arousal in order to improve attention.</p>

<p>For those with ADHD...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his recent book, Spark, John Ratey, M.D., shows that physical activity — even something as small as fidgeting the hands — increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the way ADHD medications do. Both chemicals play a key role in sharpening focus and increasing attention.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just based on my experience with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and ADHD inattentive subtype (formerly known as ADD). I have a fidget cube and I used it when I’m anxious and/or need help to focus. For my ADHD, I often need an extra stimulus to focus, whether it be music, moving around, or fidgeting (although too many stimuli at once is too distracting). The fidget cube helps me focus without distracting other people because it’s quiet and pretty unnoticeable. For my anxiety, certain repeating certain thoughts/actions help “ground” me or bring me back to the reality that I am in control of what I do as a result of my anxious thoughts. I have done counting, naming things I’m thankful for, pacing, etc. They’re added stimuli that distract my brain from the anxiety so that I can better focus on the present instead of worrying about the pat, present, and future simultaneously. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has an 'optimal' level of arousal and sensory processing needed to perform.
Essentially it is the 7 senses all working together to keep you functioning (sight, touch, taste, hearing, smell, kineasthic (body movements in space) and vestibular (when you are moving, keeps things in check. See vertigo if unsure what happens when this sense fails)). </p>
<p>Think of it as a just right zone. If it is too dark, your eyes will tell your brain to sleep. If it is too bright, you are very alert and awake(see flashing lights im clubs). If you get too worked up and anxious, being held/ deep pressure can help bring you to the just right zone. If you are finding yourself falling asleep when you shouldn't be, light strokes on the arm can wake you up.</p>
<p>If you are too still, your brain will tell your body to move (fidgeting, bouncing legs etc). This in part keeps yourself alert and awake. If you bite your nails / need to chew things, it tends to have a calming effect (much similar to a blanket wrap).  As mentionee it can trick your brain into thinking it is safe.</p>
<p>This kind of research is called senory awareness. I would highly recommended a lady called Winnie Dunn. It is very interesting stuff. And it has a very clear link to mental health maintenance. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense. As the brain and nervous system is a very complex system, often tricking itself to keep you maintained. </p>
