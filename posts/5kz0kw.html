<p>Weight, on the other hand, is usually just a way to represent the mass of the object in terms easier for people to understand.  After all, these bodies are all in free fall, so their mass is the relevant metric.  This can be estimated by applying our general knowledge of the composition of celestial bodies, but it's also extremely common to measure the gravitational interactions between bodies to estimate their size - gravity is, after all, a product of mass.  When we describe a celestial body as &quot;weighing&quot; a certain amount, it's usually just what it would weigh in standard Earth gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<pre><code>
The mass of the star is a bit harder to find. Fortunately, stars lie in a (somewhat) narrow mass range depending on what type of star it is and what color it is (this is due to 5 very messy nested differential equations). If you are not familiar with the H-R graph, it plots the luminosity of a bunch of stars against its color. 

The actual calculation of the mass has a lot of assumptions and computational methods involved. Basically a main sequence star has three significant regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The central density and temperature of the core is assumed to be at a density and temperature range where Hydrogen (or helium) fusion is allowed (which is surprisingly narrow). The radiative zone and the convective zones both have a cut-off point. Using surface temperature, luminosity and a bunch of complicated math, we can figure out the change in density in radius, which we can then find the mass because we know the volume.

Again, most people just use a simplication because it turns out for at least for stars *in the main sequence*, the mass of the stars pretty much determines "what color/size/brightness" they are. This means we can guess how massive the star is just by its color. It makes sense since the way stars form are pretty standardized, and most of the variables regarding their creation are pretty unchanged except for mass. Think of starmaking as a stellar "machine" with one adjustable "knob".

Unfortunately, a lot of the variables themselves within the equations are assumed, like the central density of the star and the cutoff points of the zones. That's why we have such a high uncertainty for stellar masses.

<p>It gets much easier if we have a star orbiting a &quot;standardized&quot; stellar object like a white dwarf, a neutron star or other &quot;stellar candles&quot;. This is because all we need to know about the system is the mass of the stellar object and its orbital mechanics. White dwarves and neutron stars are by &quot;design&quot; in a VERY narrow mass range. Their mass is also pretty easy to calculate, since they are usually elemental. We then use those stars to set &quot;standards&quot; for what each star of that specific color should be in the range of.</p>
