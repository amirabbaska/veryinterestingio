		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the history of the polygraph (lie detector) and its legal status is a very interesting one. In 1923, the US Supreme Court ruled that they were <em>not</em> admissible evidence in court, because the consensus among scientific experts was that they could not prove whether someone was lying or not. For 70 years this standard of scientific evidence (&quot;do other scientists think it is science?&quot;) was the legal standard of the US (called the Frye standard, from the polygraph case). In the 1990s it was superseded by different guidelines (the Daubert standard, which is very different).</p>
<p>My understanding is that while you could not introduce polygraph evidence as a piece of damning evidence, it was ruled that you could introduce it as possible exculpatory evidence: because it was assumed that it would be easy for it to give a false positive (and say someone was lying when they were not), if you took a test and it showed you were not lying, and this somehow helped the defendant, then it was admissible. </p>
<p>Today the process is a little more complicated: judges can determine whether polygraph evidence is admitted (which is in line with the Daubert approach, which puts a lot more power in the hands of the judges to decide what is and what is not scientific evidence), but in general the legal system is pretty skeptical of the idea of convicting someone on the basis of a polygraph examination. </p>
<p>What's <em>really</em> interesting though is that the primary use of the polygraph in the US is <em>not</em> in courts at all. As a form of evidence, it is pretty suspect. But as a ritual that scares people into confessing (sometimes, it is feared, falsely), it is <em>very</em> effective. Hook people up to a science machine and say that it tells you whether they are lying or not, and people start sweating and telling you things. The most famous example of this comes from lore about police officers who hooked a suspect up to a Xerox machine and photocopied a piece of paper that said &quot;LIE&quot; on it whenever they wanted to tell the suspect they didn't believe him, and the suspect confessed after this. </p>
<p>So the <em>value</em> of a polygraph is less that it actually gives scientific or legally binding evidence of truth-telling or lying, but that it has psychological power over people. And this has, apparently, been very successful at getting them to tell the truth. </p>
<p>The actual scientific &quot;status&quot; of the polygraph is very much in debate; some say it can be used effectively, some say it is total pseudo-science. The question hinges not on whether it gives information that is sometimes true but how reliable it is: it is worth someone going to prison (or losing their job, or whatever) if there is some chance of it being totally incorrect? Even if it was right 90% of the time, there would still be a large number of people who failed it unjustly.</p>
<p>But again, for the purpose of getting confession, that doesn't seem to matter much — if people think, even subconsciously, that it works, then it turns into a useful tool, even if it doesn't produce admissible or powerful evidence for court on its own terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The results of a lie detector (ABC is lying) is not admissible as evidence.</p>
<p>The statements made by the person taking the test (I like hats) can be admissible.</p>
<p>Lie detector tests are not used to generate evidence in the form of knowing whether someone was lying. Lie detector tests are used as a tool to generate confessions.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Bob is accused to killing Tom. The investigator has Bob take a lie detector test. The investigator tells Bob that he failed the lie detector test, and that he's going to go to prison unless he cooperates. If he confesses, the investigator will make sure that they go easy on him. Bob confesses to killing Tom.</p>
<p>The fact that Bob took the test is usually not admissible. The results of the test are not admissible (nor did they matter in the example; even if he had passed, the investigator would have said he failed to get the confession). The confession that follows <strong>is</strong> admissible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
