		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol affects the part of your brain (cerebellum) that controls your balance in your core and coordination for walking. Sitting is easier than standing when it comes to coordination. When you stand suddenly you need to start balancing and coordinating more and you will notice you're not as good at it. </p>
<p>I don't believe the small blood pressure changes which will recover in 10-15 seconds account for any meaningful difference. The dizziness of orthostatic hypotension (lightheadedness from your blood pressure briefly dropping on standing) is very different from the decreased coordination of drunkenness. </p>
<p>Source: am a doctor and also have personal experience with both drunkenness and orthostatic hypotension :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Student nurse here. Standing up causes your blood pressure to drop. Stand up too quickly and you'll feel light headed. That's why when patients are on anti-hypertension medications, we have to caution them to get up slowly as these types of meds will make you feel even more dizzy if you get up too quickly.</p>
<p>Alcohol has a similar effect. It depresses your system. When you're drunk or are on certain medications, your body can't stabilise your blood pressure fast enough when you try to stand, making you feel even more dizzy than if you were sober.</p>
<p>Edit: There are a couple of doctors here so they're more qualified to answer this question than someone still in school. Alcohol passes through the blood/brain barrier and affects the cerebellum, causing deficits in coordination. Much of the experience I've drawn my conclusions from were from patients who did suffer from orthostatic hypotension and knowing alcohol affects coordination, I thought/think those two things add to feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>I also think that since alcohol affects the body systemically and not just the cerebellum, it may also affect the parts of the brain that plays a role in maintaining blood pressure. Alcohol does have a depressant effect if you drink too much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably because it takes more coordination to stand up than sit down. You are able to notice the drunkenness more because you are asking more of your brain and body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason is the shift of blood away from the brain. This is caused by many factors. Alcohol causes a shift in blood flow, increasing blood to some areas and decreasing it to others. This was found to be a cause of alcohol related diabetes. Alcohol is also a potent diuretic, which reduces overall blood flow. One of the hallmark symptoms of dehydration is dizziness on standing, which comes from the reduced blood flow to the brain. </p>
<p>I'll try to remember to post sources later when I'm not on mobile. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word, gravity. Standing up allows your blood to move down into your legs effectively lowering the blood pressure in your upper body (and head) which leads to a feeling of light headedness. If already dizzy from inebriation, it will just become more pronounced when you standup. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
