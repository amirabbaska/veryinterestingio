		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HOLY MOTHER OF PATRICK STEWART every reply in this thread so far is just wrong. </p>
<p>STOP with the oil gland stuff. Just stop. </p>
<p>Yes there are more oil glands on the top of the head. But bald heads (most, not all) shine like glass when they are dry, clean, and free of oil. </p>
<p>The scalp skin is stretched tight and is thinner than other places...and it is just naturally shiny. I'll try and edit tomorrow with a link that explains the skin properties. But the short answer is that it is the SKIN that just shines. Not some mega oil slick. My head, straight out of the shower after real soap, shines like Bruce Willis. </p>
<p>You want an oil slick? Feel the back of your neck at the end of the day...rub it and smell your hand. Not enough? Rub hard behind your ears, then touch a mirror. FBI fingerprints everywhere. Take a knife and slide it across your neck...gently...like you are shaving with it...then look at the blade. Yeah you freak, its oily. But guess what? Your neck isn't shiny. Neither are your ears. Scalps shine because of the properties of the skin, not the oil.</p>
<p>Source: been bald longer than most of y'all have been alive. Stay off my lawn. </p>
<p>edit: words. </p>
<p>edit 2: yeah, oil does make it shiny. (GROSS ALERT) If I eat a huge pork meal, a few hours later the oil will start coming out..you can see it, but it's a DULLER shine. Not like clean skin. In fact, the more oily my head is, the less it shines. The shiniest is at the start of they, after a hot shower and Dial, Zest, or Irish Spring soap. </p>
<p>edit 3: I've been at this for 90 straight minutes. Putting my bald head on my oil-free pillow. This is not conjecture. You boys (or anyone with access to a scrotum) take your ball sack and stretch it tight. Oh look...it shines. Same as a swollen bee sting or a late-term pregnant belly. Tight skin shines. Now go to bed. Y'all have school and work tomorrow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also vellus or soft downy hair covering the rest of the body. On the scalp of a bald man the follicles are dead therefore there isn't vellus our terminal hair.   there's nothing to dull the reflection of light</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple things that influence shine on any object, including skin.</p>
<p>Part of it is form factor. Shiny skin is really just the reflection of light, like an arrow rebounds from the light off the object and into the eye, and a dome shaped object like a head will always be positioned to reflect a light source into your eyes unless the light source is in between you, which is a small angle. The sun in the sky would almost always throw a reflection. The reflection is called specular light.</p>
<p>The other part is the roughness of the surface itself, called the diffusion coefficient. If you study your fingers you would see that the individual ridges are very shiny, but they do not reflect light in a consistent direction so they don't add up to a strong specular reflection.</p>
<p>I can't say exactly what causes your typical arm or leg to appear to have a low diffusion coefficient -- they don't seem shiny but also lack fingerprints. Maybe it's because the head is more oily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin of humans (and most mammals) contains sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance that lubricates and waterproofs the skin and hair. In humans, these glands are concentrated more on the face and scalp. Also, some people polish their bald scalp to make it shine more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
