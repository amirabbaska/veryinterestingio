		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap, your faucet, your tooth brush, the glass you drink water out of, all has bacteria on it. We don't live in a sterile environment and we ourselves are not sterile. You have more bacteria in your mouth, and fungal spores, than on your tooth brush. </p>
<p>Having bacteria isn't the problem, it's having a place for bacteria to multiply and grow into a colony unopposed and for that you need food, water, shelter, and no competition. Your tooth brush has only one of those things. </p>
<p>The job of a tooth brush is not to sterilize your mouth, it's to wash away the metabolic junk and plaque that eats away at your teeth. It denies the colonies in your mouth food and a medium to safely grow in (plaque). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A tooth brush is not a disinfecting agent. It's meant to scrape away excess food, not kill bacteria. Your mouth is ahead good enough at dealing with bacteria; removing excess carbohydrates by brushing just limits bacterial growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If we were reliant on our own sanitation efforts to keep from getting sick (washing our hands, sterilizing eating utensils etc.) we would be long since dead.</p>
<p>It feels good to wash your hands and feel like all the evil bacteria is gone, but that's mostly naive first world logic, its not that simple. And someday we may arrive at the collective conclusion that antibacterial soaps are simply not necessary for everyday use (discounting things like surgery, idk).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>You know you can walk outside and eat dirt and be fine right? Kids do it all the time.</p>
