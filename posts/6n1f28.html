		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>English as it was spoken during colonial times isn't the same as it is spoken now in either Britain or America. Both populations have had their pronunciation drift over time. So Americans never lost their British accent, because they never had what we would now call a British accent to begin with.</p>
<p>You can look up &quot;Original Pronunciation&quot; (Called OP English) to get an idea of how pronunciation has changed over time since the early 17th century. There are people who do Shakespeare productions using reconstructed OP to recreate what Shakespeare's plays would have originally sounded like.</p>
<p>P.S. I should have linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7tZFqg2PqU" target="_blank">this</a> from the beginning.</p>
<p>P.P.S. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIZgw09CG9E" target="_blank">Here</a> is another video talking about a modern accent that many think is close to what colonial-era English sounded like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There never was a single English accent and still isn't. America was populated firstly by various English accents and then various non-English accents which grew over time regionally depending on the mix of people. Most English accents have remained relatively similar in their respective regions but again, movement of people and the advent of TV and radio has affected all accents, some to a very small degree and some to a large degree. The 'English' accent you probably think of is called Received Pronunciation and is newer than the US is. This isn't a 'natural' accent and is onpy spoken by people of a particular schooling and isn't very common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the modern English accent is far different from that in the mid 18th century. During the late 18th century, in England they experienced what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English" target="_blank">rhotic shift</a>, which basically means dropping the r's. This started among the upper classes, and then spread to the rest of the country becuase it sounded more &quot;posh.&quot;</p>
<p>In the US, at the same time, the waves of European immigrants brought in huge numbers from Germany, Italy, and Poland. So, not only did the US not experience the rhotic shift, but the language was influenced by a great many non-native English speakers.</p>
<p>So, what did accents sound like in the late 18th century? There are some parts of the US that still preserve their original accents. Listen to these people in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIZgw09CG9E&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Tangier Island, Virginia</a></p>
<p>In general, US Southern accents are probably closer to 18th century English than modern RP English is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
