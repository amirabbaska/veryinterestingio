<p>But forgetting about that, you can find specific combinations of particles in the standard model which do not directly couple to one another. For example neutrinos do not couple to photons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How &quot;at all&quot; are we talking here? Planck-length? Trillionths of a billionth of a second? </p>
<p>There are processes all around you that are so instantaneous and brief in their conception, execution, and termination that it's hard to say if it occurred at all.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Particle_physics" target="_blank">Higgs Boson</a>.</p>
<p>These particles are of fundamental order and don't really &quot;exist&quot; as a particle until circumstances essentially condensate them (like rain from a cloud) into being for almost undetectable periods of time. Otherwise, they are as more of a wave field of probable influence.</p>
<p>They don't typically interact though, they just... are. The larger particles they aid the composition of interact, but they themselves are an expression of the attenuated resonant vibrations that make up reality, and have influence upon it in an ascribed manner. </p>
<p>The LHC excels at their capacity to burp these particles into being in such a way that we can find them. In fact, prior to the LHC, the concept of the Higgs Boson was met with ridicule and scoffed at by some scientific communities because it was considered a sort of particle based &quot;Snipe Hunt&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One simple example is that photons don't interact with each other. You can shoot two beams of photons at each other and you'll never get one to scatter off the other. You do get constructive/destructive interference. But I think it's fair to say that's not exactly the same as the particles interacting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
