The photon bounces around many thousands of times on average before it escapes the sun. The mean free path of a photon in the interior of the sun is about 2 centimeters. This is the average distance it travels in between bounces. If you compare this length to the radius of the sun, you see why it takes so long for the photons to escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light you see coming out of the sun was actually emitted within a very small distance from the surface of the sun. This is also why the sun mostly emits visible light, because near the surface, the sun is only a few thousand degrees. At that temperature, the blackbody radiation spectrum is peaked in the visible. The core of the sun is millions of degrees, which would emit a lot of UV light, but that light is absorbed before it can reach the surface.</p>
<p>When people say light takes a million years to go from the core of the sun to the surface, they are technically wrong. No light goes from the core to the surface. What this number refers to is the expected amount of time for a &quot;random walker&quot; to reach the surface, given the amount of time it takes on average to scatter or &quot;randomize&quot; the walker's path.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of everything mentioned, but for the bonus question, light has no age. Every photon was just &quot;born&quot; (according to its relativistic age). Since time is always observed in relation to the speed of light, if you are traveling at the speed of light, no time ever passes (theoretically)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side facts:</p>
<p>The sun is big and round. Light leaving a point on its surface goes in all directions. From your perspective, you're seeing light from the edges too.</p>
<p>You're right that it takes minutes for light to reach earth, but it takes light leaving from the edge of the  sun several more seconds to reach you than light leaving the face nearest you does.</p>
<p>Literally side facts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see your question has been answered by other great responses but wanted to add a fun fact: This was the reason scientists were worried neutrinos were acting as tachyons. Neutrinos from the core would reach Earth faster than photons would. It was then discovered that this was due to the neutrino's comparably weak interaction versus the random scattering of photons, thus they would escape the sun before photons could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
