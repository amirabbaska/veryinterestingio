		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:</p>
<p>Can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? Why or Why not?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a amazing question and one I cannot fully anwer. The sheer complexity of the nervous system is mind boggling. From my understanding you phrasing however is somewhat flawed. Prosthetics don't 'interface', for lack of a better word, with nerves. They instead use the output of said systems. You're nerves send a signal to your muscles and the muscle responds in a way it's biologically designed to. We can read that response and use it as input.</p>
<p>What is mystifying to a certain degree is that even though you would expect our nerves and muscles to be hard wired from brain to muscle this is actually not the case. Even though the nerves or wires run from A to B they don't seem to be hardset into performing a single function. The human body has adopted to be more flexible. </p>
<p>In essence a baby is a prime example. They will hit themselves in the face trying to get their arm movements right. It's like a robot running through calibration to asses their range of freedom. Given enough time a adult could rework their nervous system into signaling a appendage to respond to their desires.</p>
<p>But to boil it down. Do people born without a arm lack the nerves to control a prosthetic? Biologically yes. Could they adapt to using a prosthetic arm? Yes, but it becomes harder with age.</p>
<p>Don't have the time to provide sources atm but I hope others will do so as well and challenge my views on this topic. It's interesting to think about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Are there prosthetics which hook up to nerves directly?  I'm aware of myoelectric prosthetics, which use muscle activation to control the prosthetic.  If there are nerve prosthetics, this may not apply (&quot;use it or lose it&quot; might still enter into it, depending on the nerves you want to use.)</p>
<p>Myoelectric prosthetics would be somewhat more difficult to control than with normal amputees because the muscles that are usually used (the ones that previously served the limb) would be atrophied to nothing with no actual innervation (&quot;use it or lose it&quot; principle of neurology).  However, there's no reason other muscles couldn't be used, it just adds some difficulty.</p>
<p>There have been demonstrations of robots controlled by brain electrodes.  So there's always hope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like the body isn't &quot;hardwired&quot; to do anything when it comes to neurons.  They've proven many times that you can rewire different appendages to replace missing ones.  The real question is, if the brain was never trained to modulate neurons for a limb that didn't exist, you wouldn't be able to &quot;rewire&quot; it.  I'd think you'd have to train from scratch, as it were.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is 'yes', but it's obviously more complicated than that.</p>
<p>I am an engineer working for a  startup company that makes the kind of 'advanced' prosthetic hand you refer to, which has 6 degrees of freedom/the ability to achieve multiple grip patterns. I have some personal experience testing our hand with a wide variety of prosthetic control systems, including with congenital amputees.</p>
<p>The most advanced commercially available control interface available to amputees right now is pattern recognition, which uses an array of electrode sites (usually around 8 differential pairs) to measure muscle activity, and classifies the muscle pattern into discrete grips. The user will train the system by imagining moving their phantom limb to a desired grip, and this data is used by a simple machine learning algorithm (linear discriminant analysis). This is obviously different than the direct nerve interface you mention (which exists in research, more on that later) but is essentially the current state of the art, at least for commercially available systems. To finally answer your question, these systems can be used on congenital amputees, but overall their control quality is reduced. If you're interested, here's a paper with more details on an actual experiment with congenital amputees: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321690/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321690/</a></p>
<p>I have actually tried a pattern recognition system with a congenital amputee (below elbow, very proximal) in our lab, and his control was actually better than some traumatic amputees we've worked with, so there are outliers.</p>
<p>I'm less familiar with direct nerve interfaces, but there is research being done right now on invasive prosthetic control and sensory feedback. I'm most familiar with Dustin Tyler's group, but there are many researchers working on peripheral nerve interfaces, and at least one company I know of is trying to commercialize it. I don't know of any research on using such a system with a congenital amputee, but the result should be similar; prosthesis control is possible, but inferior for congenital amputees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow-up question. What are the hurdles in creating direct nerve-to electronics interfaces? From what I know, and as the comment by /u/Soltrix states, current technology focuses on sensing muscle contractions and then moving the prosthetic. At the same time, I've seen a couple of videos about paralyzed people controlling things using a brain interface, with a plug literally implanted in their heads, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7399q/the-paralysed-man-who-can-control-a-robotic-arm-with-his-mind" target="_blank">like this one</a>.<br />
So what stops scientists from creating an implantable needle that is positioned next to a nerve, that is used to sense the current that nerve transmits directly?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
