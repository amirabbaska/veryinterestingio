<p>Edit: Holy crap this is a lot of responses. Thanks so much! And yes I know that plants are green because they reflect green light, sorry for the confusing wording.</p></div></div>

<p>This is because most plant life would overheat and their enzymes would denature if they were to absorb all spectra of light - therefore green is the commonly used colour as it reflects mid-energy photons and absorbs high energy (blue) light and lower energy (red) light</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting side note; there are LED lights out there (usually called 'ufo' lights) that only put out the blue/red spectrums of light, so the plants that they shine on are receiving all of the light that is being given off. If you are in a room with only these lights on the plants, the leaves of the plant look black, because there is no green-spectrum light to bounce off of them. It's pretty easy to deduce that the green light is what's being <em>reflected</em> after seeing this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a Minute Earth video on that exact subject: <a href="https://youtu.be/aAQYpra4aUs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/aAQYpra4aUs</a></p>
<p>Basically, since there is an abundance of yellow and green sunlight, early photosynthetic bacteria at the surface of the sea were magenta, meaning they absorbed green light and let red and blue through. So other organisms deeper in the water developped the ability to absorb that red and blue light, which made them green. But chlorophyll turned out to have other advantages over the magenta molecules, so that's the form of photosynthesis that took over the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
