		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chances of you needing a seatbelt in a bus are far less than in a VW bug. The weight and size of a bus makes it inherently safer to drive in than a smaller vehicle.</p>
<p>The only problem here is if the bus flips. Then you're fucked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was once in a bus accident on a non-divided highway back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>We were driving along in a coach bus at 100km/h.  A van driving in front of us slowed down, signaling a right turn at a side road.  Our bus pulled into the oncoming traffic lane to pass them on the left.  The van turned left, and got T-boned by the bus at 100km/h.</p>
<p>As a passenger near the back, it felt like we hit a speedbump.  I just felt light on my seat for a second, then everything was normal again.  We were then confused as to why the bus was pulling over.</p>
<p>The van had its entire side destroyed.  You could see the steel beam that runs down the side of the van in relief, every body panel and window on the left side of the van was crushed.  Fortunately there were no serious injuries in the van (but probably lots of whiplash).</p>
<p>In summary:  momentum is awesome.  As far as I can recall, this bus had no seatbelts.</p>
<p>(Ironic part:  we were watching a movie on the bus.  It was &quot;Alive&quot;, and our bus accident happened shortly after the airplane crash scene was shown.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Town/ city buses drive at about 20-30 mph. They have handles often on sides or the seat in front. They are not legally required to have seat belts atleast here in the uk. And the inconvenience of having to take it on and off every time someone wants off.
On the other hand, coaches or intercity buses travel on highways often faster and are required by law to have them and in proper operating condition. And people don't get on and off as often. These are checked on every inspection and yearly MOT(government vehicle check)
Ps- city buses can drive fast but only when no passengers on board </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI buses in the U.K. Won't emergency stop either. This is because they don't have seat belts so hitting the brakes hard would increase the risk of injury more than hitting the object and slowing down using this (slow speeds only)</p>
<p>One of the things a friend got told when learning to ride a motorbike was don't mess with buses they won't stop for you </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
