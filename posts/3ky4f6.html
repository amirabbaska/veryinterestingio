		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not defying gravity.  The entire weight of the gyroscope is still supported by the person's finger or the string or whatever.  If you drop a gyroscope it will still fall to the ground just like any other object.</p>
<hr />
<p>But it's definitely doing something weird, right?  It's a little complicated, but it has to do with the quirks of rotational momentum.  If you hit a hockey puck from the right side, it will move to the left.  No surprise.</p>
<p>But when you try to rotate an already-rotating object, weird stuff happens.  Basically, movement happens in a direction <em>perpendicular</em> to the force.  So when gravity is trying to tip the gyroscope downwards, instead it just ends up pushing it sideways.  That's why the gyroscope spins in circles on the person's finger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're five, so you don't know what the word' momentum' means, but you probably understand the idea. If something big is moving it's really hard to stop it.
Momentum is a measure of how much oomph a moving object has, it's equal to the objects speed times how massive it is. The big moving object had lots of momentum so it was hard to stop. </p>
<p>There's also something called 'angular momentum', it's the same thing but for a spinning object. Basically if something is spinning, it's hard to make it spin in another direction. So you have your spinning gyroscope on a point, for it to fall over on its side its angular momentum would have to change. </p>
<p>That's what is happening with a gyroscope. It's not defying gravity (the gyroscope is being held up by a finger against gravity), it's just not falling over. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ITT people explaining how a force on a spinning object results in a perpendicular vector. </p>
<p>That's nice and all, but how exactly does something spinning and being pulled down result in it moving to the side? Why doesn't a spinning objects simply tilt down around his finger/fulcrum? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a horizontal spinning disk in front of you. Let's turn off gravity for simplicity, but say that it's free to rotate around other directions than the vertical if you hit it (i.e. it can freely pivot around its center).</p>
<p>So do that. You smack the part of the spinning disk that's near you downward. The point you hit had a lot of horizontal momentum, and gained some downward momentum from your motion. So the direction it moves in when it's near you is now tiltedslightly downward. What did that do to the rotation axis? It tipped it to the <em>side</em>; the axis that the circle is spinning around tilted in a direction perpendicular to you, not toward you.</p>
<p>Rotate this whole picture 90 degrees and you have the gyroscope here. The thing is already spinning in the vertical plane around a horizontal axis. Gravity is trying to apply a torque that's equivalent to smacking the bottom of the spinning disk appropriately to get it to tilt, as a rotate image of what we did above. This has the end effect of tilting the axis of the disk <em>sideways</em>, and gravity continuously exerting this torque causes the gyroscope to spin around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
