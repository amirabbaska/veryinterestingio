<p>Compressions during CPR are better than nothing, but they aren't as efficient as a heart beating on it's own, so you have to go faster to compensate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You nailed it with 120bpm but a lot of guidance, or people who've trained under older courses, still go lower. So frinstance &quot;do it to the beat of Stayin Alive&quot; is now slightly outdated advice. Although still better than nothing!</p>
<p>Ironically, great beats to use for CPR include Groove Is In The Heart, How To Save A Life, I Will Survive, and Break Your Heart by Taio Cruz.</p>
<p>(personally, I use Walk by Pantera)</p>
<p>EDIT- if you want to find your own memorable track, jog.fm breaks music down by bpm and genre for runners</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Survivability in cardiac arrest requires generation of adequate flow- and even with good CPR this is low, mostly because each compression’s flow is lower than what the heart could do. To compensate we increase the rate a bit.</p>
<p>But, I like to think of true explanation to a 5 year old as inevitably responding to a string of “why?” Questions. - so here goes...</p>
<p>Cardiac output (CO) is what your organs (brain, kidneys etc) need to function. Think of it like flow rate (measured in L/min),
It is a function of stroke volume (SV) - or blood pumped per beat - and Heart Rate (HR, beats per minute) or otherwise CO = SV x HR.
Using average (at rest) values 75mls per beat and 70bpm this is about 5 liters per minute</p>
<p>In CPR and in actual physiology, SV isn’t widely variable-  the heart doesn’t change size beat to beat (though it can over time) but HR is.
In fact increased HR (via adrenaline system) is the most immediate way a live person’s body regulates cardiac output.</p>
<p>However, in CPR (by definition a dead person) The heart is not beating, so SV is zero. The purpose of compressions is to turn the chest cavity into a bellows system (not really “pumping the heart,” the non-beating heart is little more than a reservoir at this point.)
Each compression pumps blood out and recoil of the chest wall creates negative pressure to draw blood into the chest cavity.
The stroke volume of a compression is much less than that of the heart (‘less efficient’ as written by everyone above) - maybe 30-40 mls. Doing the math it is easy to see that a higher rate is needed to get minimal cardiac output.</p>
<p>This same concept explains low resting heart rates in athletes. Their conditioned heart is more efficient, putting out maybe up to 90mls per beat, so they can afford a lower rate </p>
<p>So why not compress faster? Well, given the basic equation this sounds better- but with each increase in rate there is a decrease in SV - this happens because there is less time between compression/beats to “fill”. There is a “break-even” point, and for chest compressions this is about 120 bpm.  Faster than that and cardiac output starts going down due to decreased SV. </p>
<p>There are more factors to consider that are just outside the context of the question asked- like resistance in the system (dilation and construction of blood vessels, the main reason we currently give epinephrine in cardiac arrest), ventilations (oxygenation, acid/base balance, intrathoracic pressure) etc, etc. </p>
