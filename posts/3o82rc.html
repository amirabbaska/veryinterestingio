<p>This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. </p>
<p>But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. </p>
<p>So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from? </p>
<p>EDIT: I hate edit chains so I will keep this short. Thanks for all the answers guys!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Well this blew up</p>
<p>EDIT 3: Wow front page thanks guys!</p>
