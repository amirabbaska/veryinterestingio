What a wonderful selection of insightful comments and questions. Consider me impressed and proud to be a Redditor. If you want more, tonight you can see me demonstrating my research in &quot;Memory Hackers&quot; on PBS at 8/9c. See you again for AMA round 2 when I launch my book &quot;The Memory Illusion&quot; in June!<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hi Reddit! </p>
<p>I study how we can create incredibly detailed memories of things that never actually happened. In particular, I implant rich false memories of committing crime with police contact and other highly emotional autobiographical events. I thought I’d share my work with the community, since I’m an avid Redditor.</p>
<p>The technique I use in my research is essentially a combination of what's called “mis-information&quot; (telling people convincingly that something happened that didn’t) and an imagination exercise which makes a participant picture the event happening. The goal is to get my participants to confuse their imagination with their memory. I find, as do many other scientists who study memory, that it is often surprisingly easy to implant memories. All of my participants are healthy young adults, and in my last study 70% of them were classified as having formed these full false memories of crime by the end of the study. I am currently working on further research and analysis to see whether I can replicate this, since this success rate was incredibly high.</p>
<p>Last year some of this research, which I did with Stephen Porter at UBC, went viral. It was so amazing to see such a great reaction from the press and public. There really seems to be a thirst for wanting to understand our faulty memories. You can see my favourite write up of the research [here] (<a href="http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/how-did-researchers-convince-so-many-people-they-had-committed-a-violent-crime" target="_blank">http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/how-did-researchers-convince-so-many-people-they-had-committed-a-violent-crime</a>).  In “<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/memory-hackers.html" target="_blank">Memory Hackers</a>,” a NOVA documentary airing tonight on PBS at 9pm Eastern time, you can actually see some real footage from the videos that I made during the interviews, which you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AxIGmjEP4" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
<p>I actually have a whole book coming out this summer on memory hacking. It’s the first popular science book of it’s kind, and I’m super excited about it! If you find my research interesting you’ll definitely like the book. The book will be released in 8 languages (English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, Taiwanese, Chinese, and Japanese) and will be called “The Memory Illusion”. You can get preliminary information about it <a href="http://www.drjuliashaw.com/the-memory-illusion.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
