		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>The hyperloop test track is about a quarter mile and about 4.5 feet in diameter, and by volume is the second largest vacuum chamber on Earth. There's a shit ton of energy in a vacuum, as the test track has ~14.6 psi on it which is nothing to scoff at when you have ~19,000 sq.ft (Edit: 2,736,000 sq.in, to keep consistent with the units - that's 39,945,600 lbs of pressure on the vessel) of surface area. Any falter in the structural integrity anywhere will cause a cascade implosion failure along it's entire length until the vessel ruptures and vacuum is lost. The thing is wildly dangerous just to stand next to it.</p>
<p>(Edit 2: rapid loss of vacuum is about as deadly and destructive as the implosion itself.)</p>
<p>But of course they said it's only a partial vacuum, but what they didn't get into was that their partial vacuum is ~99% to a perfect vacuum. The difference is irrelevant when you're talking a chamber this large.</p>
<p>The second prototype is currently using steel so thin it can't even support it's own weight, and they want to suspend it on pylons. And the suggested plan is to run this thing in a loop the length of California? Any earthquake, any car crash into a pillar, any punk kid who throws a brick at it, any significant falter in it's construction or due to weathering, and the thing can implode. Thicker steel and more structural support can only offset the danger until the construction is too expensive to be feasible.</p>
<p>Boarding would require chambers to hold the vacuum in the whole system while the train is accessed. Then it has to be sealed and vacuumed. They will have to build the biggest vacuum system in the world to pull a perfect vacuum in an appreciable amount of time and keep the whole system under vacuum, because the test track took about an hour per, and they had to pressurize the whole thing every time the opened it. It currently takes longer to pull a vacuum than it would take to travel the length of California by more conventional means.</p>
<p>Trains are not cost effective for passenger travel because the maintenance costs are astronomical and commuter needs are at odds, too many stops, and it's not time effective and will drive away customers, too few stops and you won't have enough customers to be cost effective. High speed trains are ever more so expensive and dangerous. In an airplane at 640 mph, any sort of bump, and you have miles space to gracefully dampen it. Any bump in a bullet train, and no matter what, it has to remain on it's rails, and now it has to remain on its rails and not hit the walls of the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>Overall, the thing is insane and the liability is huge. No one would seriously fund this project and no government safety regulators would ever allow it to go into production. But I appreciate it for what it is, and that is to get engineers and students thinking outside the box. That's all. This is a publicity stunt and they know it, but it's also a prospect for innovation they might scoop up and invest in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the hyper loop has a few problems; known, speculative and assumed.</p>
<p>We know the cost due to the price of steel and manufacturing, the well known phenomena of <a href="https://youtu.be/T9bpUfWy8Wg?t=155" target="_blank">cascade collapse</a>, material expansion due to heat (he chose a desert of all places!), and energy costs, <a href="https://youtu.be/wBY3Z4F0dxk" target="_blank">dangers</a> and time of producing a near vacuum. </p>
<p>We suppose that the hyper loop would have problems with multiple destinations, turning and basic commuting. </p>
<p>We assume that there will be some radical who sees the hyper loop as a target and protecting all 600 miles will be infeasible.</p>
<p>Hope this summarized everything nicely! I included videos just as an example of what I'm talking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed gains over conventional high speed rail are negligible.</p>
<p>The construction and operating costs are <strong>way</strong> higher (making a near-vacuum takes a <em>lot</em> of energy).</p>
<p>And safety... </p>
<p>Well, you've got a positively pressurized vessel inside a negatively pressurized vessel, and they're moving relative to each other at the speed of sound...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, some serious negativity here.  First of all, most tech starts out like this, doesn't it?  Once upon a time people said &quot;You can't travel underwater/over 100MPH/through the air/in outer space, it's too expensive/dangerous/the tech can't handle it!&quot;</p>
<p>I guess it's a good thing not everyone said &quot;Yeah, you're right, let's drop the whole thing&quot;.</p>
<p>Just because we can't do something <em>today</em>, or it isn't perfectly efficient/safe/etc., doesn't mean it shouldn't be explored and developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
