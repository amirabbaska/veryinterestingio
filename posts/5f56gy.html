That fills the screen, but the beam only hits one spot at a time. The phosphors glow brightly at first but start to fade quickly. By the time a spot is scanned again its intensity had faded significantly. If the video camera and the monitor are running at the same frame rate, the result is pretty good, but if they are running at different rates you see flicker. </p>
<p>LCDs can also have flicker, but not as bad as CRTs. Plasmas have very little flicker on camera. </p>

<p>Modern LCDs are lit by a constant backlight which may be a fluorescent bulb or LED. Both still flicker but the fluorescent bulbs may hold their glow more steadily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most things that take pictures (cameras) or show pictures (displays) use the concept of 'scanning'.</p>
<p>If you look at a photocopier (or photo scanner) you see that it moves the 'scanning head' over the paper very slowly. This concept is important - it doesn't 'take the picture' all at once because that would be difficult to engineer (and expensive).</p>
<p>Cameras and displays also use this concept of scanning, but obviously they do it much faster, and they don't use a motor. The reason is the same: they can't do everything at once, it's to difficult, they have to make or take the picture bit by bit (but very quickly).</p>
<p>The rate that a camera or display scans is called the 'refresh rate' and is in the range of 10's to 100's of times a second. If you are videoing a display, then scanning is going on in both devices at the same time. Now you should see that the 2 different refresh rates can potentially cause problems...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen the optical illusion where there's a flickering light and a spinning wheel. At certain speeds, the spokes of the wheel appear as a blur, but at other speeds, suddenly the spokes seem clear and even unmoving? That happens when the rate of the flicker matches closely the speed of the wheel so that when the light is brightest, the spokes are always in the same position (and they are less visible when there's less light).</p>
<p>The same thing happens with old video and camcorders. Old TVs used to work by spraying electrons in a beam back and forth across the inside of a glass tube that was painted with phosphorous. It would hit every other line on the screen 60 times per second (in the US). You wouldn't notice, because it happened so quickly, but each spot would glow brightly then fade quickly (enough so that each cycle it could draw a new glowing picture, which your brain would see as motion).</p>
<p>Well, the video camera is recording this flickering light from the TV. If it recorded each picture perfectly in time with the TV, then you would see the glowing part would always seem to be in the same place (just like the wheel spokes that seemed not to move). If the shutter speed of the camera is long (how long it takes in light get a frame of video), you might see a band of bright, and a band of dark. If the recorder and the TV aren't perfectly in sync with one another, that band might look like it's moving (like the flicker and the wheel spokes when the speeds are close, but not perfectly lined up). And it there's a biger mismatch in speeds, then it might look more like the TV screen is pulsing.</p>
<p>In newer sets, like LCD ones, the screen no longer works by painting in a zig-zag pattern like that. Instead, the set works by splitting the screen into picture elements (pixels; square dots on the screen), and uses electrical pulses to twist crystals that filter light passing through the screen. It generally does the entire screen at once, or close to it. If there's any flicker, it would come from a bad backlight. There can still be some flickering if there's a mismatch in speeds, but modern sets also redraw the screen 2-8x faster than the old CRTs, so it's so fast that a video recorder is unlikely to pick-up on it (and even if it did, the effect would be too subtle for a human to see).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
