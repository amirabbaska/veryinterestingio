<li>
<p>Plz ELI5 in detail they are 2 PDF inside of the website plz see those and tell us normal people everything </p>
</li>
<li>How will this discovery benefits the normal people what can a normal people do with it ones it becomes viable? </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/ramblingnonsense has a good ELI5 explinaton <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5289p0/time_crystals_objects_whose_structure_would/" target="_blank">HERE</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is about what happens to things when you take all their energy away. Think of it like dropping something on floor.</p>
<p>Many things fall down on one side or the other when you drop them. The way that the thing falls is called its resting or ground state. Figuring out what makes these things fall on one side or the other can help you learn about the object as well as the floor.
Sometimes things don't literally fall, but still have ground states. Magnets sort of pick one side to be north and the other side to be south. That's their ground state. Learning why they do this is hard and has taken a long time. Because magnets always have a north and a south pole, they are called asymmetrical, which just means they don't look the same on both sides.</p>
<p>Crystals also have asymmetrical ground states. As a crystal reaches its ground state it always has some bits that are pointy and some bits that are smooth. It's not the same on all sides, so it's asymmetrical, just like the magnets.</p>
<p>Lots of things in nature have asymmetrical ground states, but they all have one thing in common: they don't move. You have to give them some energy to make them move or to change their ground state.</p>
<p>Now some people think that there might be some weird objects that have asymmetrical ground states across time rather than space. That's what they mean by time crystals. An object like that would be interesting because, to us, they would look like they are moving in their ground state without any extra energy! Imagine if you dropped a die on the ground but instead of landing on a side, it landed on one corner and just spun forever. That's how weird these things are!</p>
<p>Because this is so hard to explain, these scientists spent most of their time just trying to define what such a weird object would look like and how you would know it when you found one. Once they did that, they used supercomputers to predict where you might find them, if they exist.</p>
<p>So far, no one has actually seen one and a lot of people think they can't exist. But now we might know where to look to see who is right!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Had I realized how fast this was going to blow up I'd chosen my words a bit more carefully! The bit about the die landing on its corner and spinning isn't meant to be a literal representation of what a time &quot;crystal&quot; would do. The article states that the ground state of such an object might be something that moves in a circle rather than sitting still. The other example they give is of a particle that oscillates despite not receiving any additional energy. I suspect (although I don't know) that classical physics probably prevents &quot;broken time-translation symmetry&quot; from working at scales big enough to see and interact with; we're talking about quantum properties here. The example with the die was merely to demonstrate the counter-intuitive nature of the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I see a lot of people are confused about the ramifications of this concept. <strong>This is not a perpetual motion machine.</strong> This is a ground state; by definition, <strong>there is no energy in the system to extract.</strong> You couldn't get energy out of it any more than you could get energy out of a rock sitting on the floor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i think i am oversimplyfing to the point is wrong, but i will give it a shot. Normal matter in his ''ground state'' (AKA doesn't release any kind of energy) don't really move at all. however, time crystals can move without releasing energy in unique ways on his ground state. and no, it doesn't violate the laws of thermodynamics, because that's how is supposed to behave a time crystal on that state. basically a weird rule of nature that may look illogical if we don't go deeper into the subject</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
