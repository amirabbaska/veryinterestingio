		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say exactly what. </p>
<p>I find I have the same problem with some people, they strike me as utterly toxic, while others don't seem to be upset by it. It's something like this:</p>
<p>There are certain personality traits I find utterly abhorrent. For example, being excessively self-assured strikes me as unspeakably arrogant. I see shades of grey on everything, and I try to form my opinions and beliefs based of the notion that there are multiple viewpoints to consider, and I can't possibly have considered all of them, so my conclusions can only be a maximum of, say, 97% valid. When stating my beliefs, I tend to preface them with qualifiers like, &quot;in my experience&quot; or &quot;correct me if I'm wrong, but...&quot;. To me, doing so conveys a decent sense of self-doubt, and a willingness to learn or be corrected. </p>
<p>I think I do this because I don't want anyone to feel like their opinion is invalid. I have been made to feel that way on the past, as though my thoughts, opinions, and experiences are without value, and it's completely dehumanizing and degrading. So I try to avoid doing that when possible. </p>
<p>People who don't have that hang up tend to strike me as arrogant, self-centered, and devoid of empathy. It's a trait that really rubs me the wrong way. </p>
<p>More recently, I've come to understand that my reaction to such people is the result of me being overly sensitive to a certain extent, and that the assumption that my opinion is not valued is not necessarily true, I just perceive it that way. Moreover, my &quot;decent sense of self-doubt&quot; is often interpreted as a spineless indecisiveness, whereas I am trying to convey more of a cautious open-mindedness. </p>
<p>I think the bottom line is that we are all the products of our past experiences, and that often, we are conditioned to react negatively to personality traits that we perceive as toxic, when perhaps they are not. </p>
<p>I'll end this with the obligatory, &quot;of course, that's just my experience. &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good thoughts listed here.  There probably isn't just one answer.  There is a woman I know who is a terrific woman, kind generous, friendly, nice looking, etc - yet I cannot stand to be with her for more than 20 minutes no matter how hard I try.  It is not due to some of the reasons I have seen listed here already.  I am going to chalk it up to &quot;chemical&quot;.  </p>
<p>I wonder if it is similar with dogs.  For example we have a shih-poo, who is a very friendly unassuming dog and is mostly submissive.  He is friendly or somewhat timid with every other dog we meet when out for a walk.  Yet every once in a great while, he viciously barks at another dog who is seemingly friendly and not showing a threatening behavior.  Not sure what to chalk this up to either - but makes me wonder if there are similarities and this is just &quot;chemical&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We all have things that are morally significant to us. Sometimes there's behavior that rubs us the wrong way because it stirs up subconscious memories of other times someone has rubbed us the wrong way or stepped over the bounds that we set up. Sometimes it's just as easy as simple expectations. When we're taught to do things a certain way, and we struggle physically, emotionally, or personally with conducting ourselves in the way that we believe society should act, it can be difficult. Then, you meet someone who knows the way they should act but completely disregards that all together, it can be irritating. </p>
<p>Certain behavior can also take you back to a time where someone else acted in a similar fashion and it caused disorder*, chaos, or psychological discomfort. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find that I can't stand people I share traits with that I hate about myself. Being an extremely sensitive person myself, I say it is really hard to get along with such people, because you always see in them the part of you that you would like to be different. But give it some time, more than often, after you've had a few good talks with them, you'll realise &quot;damn he/she's a really nice person&quot;. To sum it up: nobody can read someone's character on first sight. A lot of people think they are very good at reading other people. That's fucking BS, you actually have to get to know somebody before judging their personality. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once met another woman at the gym who I quickly decided I didn't like. But since we spent a lot of time working out together (we were part of a small club that met regularly) I started to think about why. I realized that everything I didn't like about her was related to qualities we shared, but she exhibited to a greater extent. After that I found a lot of respect for her and we became good friends. </p>
<p>Edit: I just thought of another friend, who is a lot like me, who I also initially didn't like. I wonder if this is a common thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
