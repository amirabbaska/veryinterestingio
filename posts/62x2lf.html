		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a nuclear reactor operator for 6 years. I don't know too many specifics as we didn't use this on the plant that I worked on. We used to use trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate and disodium phosphate in order maintain ph in the 10 to 11 range. You want to maintain a basic pH in order to minimize general and pitting corrosion in metals used in the plant. Im not sure if this answers part of your question let me know if it does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LIOH is used in solution, generally in water which is used as a coolant and moderator in pressurised water reactors PWRs.</p>
<p>LiOH can be used in nuclear reactors to increase the pH in the coolant. This change in pH ends up decreasing the corrosion rate in your system which leads to lower output of deposits being released into the coolant. These deposits can affect the plants hydraulic performance, change heat transfer properties of certain components and also can lead to a build up of radioactive material in the coolant created from the neutron activation of the corroded material in the reactor core. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lithium 7 is used to maintain pH in reactor coolant because it is less likely to produce tritium as a daughter product of decay. Nuclear power plants already produce tritium due to the radiolysis of water so we try to eliminate as many other sources of tritium as possible. Lithium-6 produces tritium in much higher quantities than lithium-7, so my plant purchases lithium with as low a concentration of lithium-6 as possible. </p>
