<p>Almost all countries that were once colonized do military parades to celebrate their independence, or the day when the republic was institutionalized. The French do it to celebrate the fall of the Bastille. Make a search for how the Indians and Mexicans do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially if your country has any sense of nationalism they'll occasionally show off their Armory.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not communist states, specifically, that often have demonstrations of military power.  Generally speaking, it's highly centralized states that have these shows of force so whether it's communist, fascist, monarchical, etc., it's likely that they have some type of military parade every so often for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it's a morale boost.  Having a big demonstration gets the people all riled up, gets them feeling patriotic and nationalistic even if the living conditions are destitute.  Especially when you believe you're fighting &quot;the evil <em>insert whoever you think is evil here</em>&quot;, the military gets raised up to an exceptionally high role of honor and leadership in society. Think about the war-time propaganda even in the US during the world wars.  </p>
<p>Secondly, it's used as a show of force. Global politics can often seemingly devolve into a pissing match between two states and being better than the other guy is important for both your country and your geopolitical image.  The good old Teddy Roosevelt quote about carrying a big stick sometimes requires that everybody else knows you've got the big stick... So to speak.  The US and the USSR fought tooth and nail over every scientific and militaristic accomplisment in the 20th century and is a big reason why there's an American flag on the moon (all the sun bleaching probably turned it into a French flag now! :P).  </p>
<p>Finally, they become tradition.  Regardless of why you had the parade in the first place, they become an annual tradition to distract people from the real world for a little bit.  Patriotism and nationalism can be very important to different countries for different reasons but they can be a way to unite the people under a single cause and a single flag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In the UK, we have big military demonstrations, air shows, parades... Most countries with a military tradition do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well for Estonia:<br />
Estonia’s Independence Day parade marked national independence that had been successfully defended militarily. The Estonian Army’s roots, however, were in the Imperial Russian Army. A total of nearly 100,000 Estonians had been mobilised into the Russian Army over the course of World War I. Estonian officers received their training at Russian military schools, mostly in abbreviated wartime courses.When military units consisting entirely of Estonians started being formed in the Russian Army in 1917, their formation took place according to Russian army regulations, and those same regulations continued to set the example for the formation of the Estonian Army over the course of Estonia’s War of Independence. Officer training at Estonia’s military school that was started up during the War of Independence was based on the corresponding Russian training manuals and this remained the case until 1927. By implication, it seems reasonable to assume that the way Estonian Army military parades were  organised had to also derive from experience in Russian Army parades at the military schools where Estonian officers received their training and in active service in the parades where their military units participated.  </p>
<p>Independence Day was first celebrated under wartime conditions on 24 February 1919. Parades were held in Tallinn, Tartu, Pärnu and Viljandi. Peace had been made in time for the second anniversary the following year, when parades were held in all centres with military garrisons. Everywhere else, local fire fighters and societies organised processions. The Kaitseliit began participating in military parades in 1925 while also organising its own parades in areas without a regular army garrison.<br />
