But what exactly is happening there? How is the body able to absorb nutrients without involving the digestive tract?</p>
<p>I hope these are not extraordinarily dumb questions. I only have middle school level background in biology (and most other things). </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells in the breast that produce milk are going to either commit suicide (this is called apoptosis and is completely normal) or the connections between those cells and neighboring cells are removed and the cells die of starvation. Other cells come in and destroy the junk thatâ€™s left behind and will get rid of most of the harmful stuff left behind. The clean up cells and the remaining cells will most likely take up and use the nutrients left behind. The destroyed cells are replaced with fat cells. </p>
<p>Breast milk contains protein, fat, and carbs. <del>All of these things can be pushed into the blood stream and easily degraded by the liver or just released in the urine.</del> </p>
<p>Edit: a lot of the time, any milk left over after weaning will leak out of the breast. unless the ducts in the breast that carry milk to the nipple are blocked, there will be discharge. release of milk is caused by a few mechanisms and it takes a while (up to months) to destroy the majority of milk producing cells. </p>
<p>Edit 2: those clean up cells will do all the work (macrophages), VERY little of those proteins, fats, or carbs will enter the blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi... Actually I would like to point out that most of the times, the breast actually produces milk in accordance to your normal feeding cycles. So very little of the milk is actually left in the glands.</p>
<p>Rest whatever u/kallassassin7 commented is quite accurate. Also the milk dribbling even after stopping weaning is normal. The colour of the milk fades with time usually. However if it doesn't stop after 6-8 weeks, then you should consult a doctor. </p>
<p>I am a second year medical student and I believe that new mothers should be aware of these facts because an informed mother equates to a healthy baby</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add, as a woman, who breast fed for 3 years. Milk does not get absorbed. It leaks out when not used or causes mastitis which is the most painful feeling of your breasts being too full. Also, high in fat milk can get 'trapped' in some of the ducts and if you squeeze it out, you get something with the consistency of yogurt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
