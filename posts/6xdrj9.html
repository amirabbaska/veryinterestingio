		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pigeons are common in cities because buildings more closely resemble their natural nesting sites.</p>
<p>Rock doves nest on the side of cliffs. Not in trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Human buildings provide lots of ledges for nesting. </p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that they're harmless, (so we don't kill them for being pests) not tasty (so we don't kill them for food) and their natural predators cannot hunt well in cities (falcons end up nose diving into walls using their usual tactics, larger predators avoid humans) and you've got the perfect combination for a species to cohabit our cities with. </p>
<p>Seagulls are also very common in cities in the UK for the same reason. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cities do have a surprising number of birds, but pigeons simply don't give a sh*t about hanging out right next to you.</p>
<p>For most birds, they want to be in trees, or up on a ledge, or in a park somewhere. On a pond. These are areas we may not visit, or at least not pay attention to in regards to birds.</p>
<p>But pigeons hang out on sidewalks and benches and bus stops where we are, so I think we notice them more often.</p>
<p>In the wild they live on big lumpy cliffs near oceans, so high rocky/stony environments with lots of noise and lots of transient visitors (humans and other animals) coming and going are right up their alley, so to speak. This is their thing!</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are a few rather exceptional photos (worldwide) and the story with them: <a href="http://www.audubon.org/news/check-out-these-fantastic-photos-birds-urban-spaces" target="_blank">http://www.audubon.org/news/check-out-these-fantastic-photos-birds-urban-spaces</a></p>
<p>And there is even a guy who does guided birding tours in NYC! <a href="https://www.birdingbob.com/" target="_blank">https://www.birdingbob.com/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, aside from what /u/posickle_in_one said, pigeons can take of vertically, which helps in urban environments.</p>
<p>speculation:</p>
<p>I wonder if their varied diet contributes? We're seeing an increase in Seagulls in urban areas in the UK, and they're known for eating any old rubbish. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most pigeons you see in cities are the semi-feral descendants of pigeons that people once bred (for food, for show, for letter-carrying, etc).</p>
<p>They have centuries of humans breeding them to be functional and useful around people, including and especially in cities, so even the ones that are mixed with wild doves &amp; wild pigeons still have some of that inheritance to them. We may have mostly stopped keeping pigeons for food &amp; show, but the pigeons didn't just vanish when we stopped intentionally breeding them.</p>
<p>Think of how wildly varied the pigeons you see in a town centre are - there are some which are grey, some nearly all black, some mottled white and brown, etc. That's a HUGE amount of visual range, especially when you compare them to wild birds which all tend to look very very similar. The only animals with as much diversity of appearance are human-bred, not fully wild (think of all the different kinds of fancy sheep, or many kinds of dogs, or all the different looking breeds of cow).</p>
<p>TL;DR - pigeons thrive in cities because humans bred variants of pigeons to be good in cities. Then we stopped looking after them, but we'd already made them good at city living by then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also culturally specific.  I have NEVER seen pigeons in China.  Perhaps it's because they are quickly eaten and have learn to avoid humans.  Whereas in Manhattan, they really don't mind getting close to people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
