		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real answer for ya:</p>
<p>America developed around it's population, and it's population will always migrate to wherever the job market is. These job markets more often than not are in big cities with corporations, factories, etc. Well most families, if given a choice (and stable income), would prefer a nice family home with plenty of space for kids, pets, and visitors rather than a cramped apartment in a noisey, bustling city. Thus, American culture gravitated towards endless suburbs instead of highrise apartments in every city. </p>
<p>Consequentially, this upped the working class's average commute time by a substantial amount. Now, not everyone is a driving enthusiast that gets rock hard switching through gears of a manual transmission day in and day out on a 50 mile, round trip commute from work to their home. GM and Ford knew this, and started mass producing automatics and marketing them towards families because the automatic trans basically sold itself to the consumer. </p>
<p>This was not the case in smaller, European countries with more established cities that had already built themselves around pedestrianism (I think that's the word), public transportation, and if needed, a cheap little manual transmission car to get you from point A to point B. Automatics aren't easy to sell to people that don't really need or want them. </p>
<p>Hope this answered your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Current automatic transmissions are actually more efficient than manuals.</p>
<p>2) Very small diesel engines never caught on in the US.</p>
<p>3) US tends to have more powerful vehicles, so small efficiencies from manual are not needed.</p>
<p>4) Manual sucks in stop and go traffic.</p>
<p>I like a stick, but I understand why a lot of people don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been almost always driving a manual in Europe, then moved to the US for some time and got an automatic. After coming back to Europe I decided to look for an automatic as well - it's easier in city traffic and more convenient if you want to drink a coffee while driving. At the time it was an Accord with a 4 speed transmission. I found it to be quite a hassle actually, since the car was often in a wrong gear and I had to manipulate the throttle and brake to get the right gear before certain maneuvers. I think it just has to do with the way European streets are roads are build (not as straight and wide as in the US, a lot of passing, tight parking). Driving is more difficult in Europe and the manual transmission often helps. That being said, I now drive a manual and miss the convenience of an automatic transmission. I also think the dual clutch auto transmission is probably better suited for European roads and I think that the technology has matured enough for me to consider it for my next car (VW group had some issues with both electronics and clutch wearing prematurely in their first transmissions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
