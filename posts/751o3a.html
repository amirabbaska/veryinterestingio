		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is pretty much impossible to melt wood. The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add <em>a lot</em> of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.</p>
<p>If you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level. The umbrella term for all of these messy reactions driven by heat is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">pyrolysis.</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. In fact the process you are describing is exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal" target="_blank">how you make charcoal</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Charcoal is usually produced by slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">pyrolysis</a> — the heating of wood or other substances in the absence of oxygen&quot;</p>
<p>Water and other volatile organic compounds (such as methanol) are basically boiled off and what remains is a large lump of carbon- a.k.a charcoal.</p>
<p>Can you melt carbon? No- not at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#Characteristics" target="_blank">atmospheric pressure</a></p>
<p>&quot;At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2 MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, just as when you boil lemonade, you don't get lemonade gas but rather steam and lemon caramel. Phase transitions don't happen to all constituents simultaneously, and plenty of other chemical reaction occur along the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can heat the wood enough to soften the lignin and then bend it.  This is maybe the closest you can get to anything similar to melting it.  Once it cools, it will stay as it was bent, this is how acoustic guitar makers bend the sides of a guitar.  It's a common technique in making furniture as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Ceramics / Pottery, wood-fired kilns utilize this effect to some extent, wood ash glazing was the primary method of finishing early Chinese and Japanese pottery. </p>
<p>Ash from the burned wood is floating around in this hot (2400F/1300C) and oxygen-starved environment, it then melts and sticks to the pottery forming a clear glaze. I think the main component of it at this point is calcium carbonate as all of the carbon has been burned off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
