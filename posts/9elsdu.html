		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a hose... and a room made of sponge.</p>
<p>The light bulb is a hose, spraying water (light) everywhere. The room is a sponge, absorbing the water (light) all the time. </p>
<p>The moment you turn the light off, it's like closing the faucet to which the hose is attached. It stops spraying water (light) everywhere, the sponge absorbs any water still traveling through the room.</p>
<p>The water (light) does not vanish instantaneously. It travels until it hits some sponge which absorbs it. It travels extremely, extremely fast, mind you, but it does take a finite amount of time to vanish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When photons hit an object, some are absorbed, some are reflected. </p>
<p>Even if you have very bright white walls, some photons are absorbed. For a short while photons will continue to bounce around until they have all been absorbed.</p>
<p>When photons are absorbed they transfer energy to the thing that absorbs them. So the light is converted to heat.</p>
<p>In theory if you had perfectly reflective walls the light would continue to bounce around forever. But if you were in the room, your body would absorb the light. Even if you covered everything but your eyes in this magic perfectly reflective material your eyes would absorb all the light in a very short space of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay. So the light bulb gives off light. This is in the form of a wave. The waves are tiny so you can't see them.  </p>
<p>So when you turn the light bulb off the light is absorbed into the walls. Some of it is reflected around, but eventually it is all absorbed. This happens very quickly because light travels at light speed (299, 792,458 meters per second). This is much too fast for your eye to perceive. Therefore it looks instantaneous to you in such a small area.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a spaceship and watching the sun beam light waves to earth. It takes around 8 minutes for that light to get to earth. You could hypothetically watch its progress. If the sun blew up or went dark, it'd take 8ish minutes for us to know it because that's how long it'd take the light to stop. The same principle applies to your room when you turn the light off. It just doesn't have very far to travel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've just done some simple calculations. Assuming the room starts at 500 lux, and is dim at 0.05 lux (roughly the brightness of a moonlit night), it's a room that's 6 meters across and the room paint has an albedo of .9, how long before the light goes away?</p>
<p>Answer: about 1.7 microseconds (edit: fixed the units; it's 1.7 microseconds, not milliseconds. And eye blink, btw, is about 300 milliseconds, so this is super much faster)</p>
