But does the gyroscope stay stable if we rotate the entire galaxy? What if we rotate the entire universe: will we, from inside the universe, observe the gyro rotating in opposite direction? The more I think about it, the more gyroscopes seem to violate the laws of relativity of frames of reference. Help!</p></div></div>

<p>This applies to linear motion, not to rotational motion. There is no &quot;absolute zero velocity&quot;, you can always pick another inertial reference frame to change the observed velocity of all objects.</p>
<p>But there is an &quot;absolute zero&quot; for angular velocity. Any object in uniform circular motion (eg an atom of the gyroscope) experiences an acceleration that grows with the square of angular velocity. Only at zero angular velocity does that acceleration go to zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When dealing with rigid body rotations, there are a handful of axes which are useful to consider. Since we're talking about objects in 3 spatial dimensions and we're interested in rotational motion but not translational motion, a rigid body has 3 degrees of freedom. In other words, its orientation at any given time can be parametrized by 3 independent angles. And we can describe its dynamics by writing down differential equations for the time evolution of these 3 angles.</p>
<p>There are two (useful) ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The body frame:</li>
</ul>
<p>This frame is fixed within the body itself. It takes the three principal axes (the eigenvectors of the inertia tensor) as its basis. In this frame, we describe the dynamics by giving the components of the angular velocity about each of the 3 principal axes. Since the body is rotating, the body frame is non-inertial. So for a free rigid body, the angular velocity vector remains fixed and the angular momentum vector can process around it, depending on initial conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The space frame:</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an inertial frame fixed with respect to the laboratory, or the Earth, or whatever inertial reference system you're in while watching the rigid body do its thing. Now the useful coordinates are the Euler angles. Two of them are just the familiar spherical polar angle (theta) and azimuthal angle (phi), and the third is called psi and what it represents can be seen on any good diagram of the Euler angles (there will be tons in Google images). So you express the dynamics of the rigid body by giving the time derivatives of the three Euler angles. Since this frame is inertial, the angular momentum vector of a free rigid body must remain fixed, and the angular velocity vector can precedes around it.</p>
<p>In either choice of frame, a gyroscope is <strong>not</strong> a free rigid body, since gravity provides a net external torque. So like you said, to say that the &quot;axis&quot; of a gyroscope is &quot;fixed&quot; depends on what axis you're talking about and in what reference frame is it &quot;fixed&quot;. You are always free to define a frame where any given axis of the gyroscope is fixed, but your frame might be non-inertial.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the best representation of rotation is as a directed plane, the normal of the plane pointing along the axis of rotation. </p>
<p>The plane of rotation is  fixed in the sense that it will not change unless acted upon by a force (a consequence of conservation of angular momentum), and it is fixed relative the orientation of the object before it started rotating or some other reference if that is more handy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
