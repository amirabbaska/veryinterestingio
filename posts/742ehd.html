		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depression is a really complicated disease. Currently, the prevailing theory for why it occurs is reduced serotonin signaling in your brain. Serotonin signaling is related to mood, but it is also related to things like movement, digestion and appetite, sleep, motivation, memory, and probably a bunch of other stuff as well. A reduction in serotonin signaling can affect any and all of these, and which ones it affects depends on both the magnitude and location in your brain of the reduction.</p>
<p>The reason why it can swing either way is really just because our brains are complicated. In some places serotonin signaling can increase a drive (like appetite) and in other areas it can act to decrease that same drive. It's also true that many other types of signaling also affect drives like appetite, and those can also be out of wack. It all really depends on the person and on the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin is probably relation to depression in some way,* and most of the serotonin in your body is in your stomach! Your enteric nervous system, which basically runs the length of your digestive system, is your second brain. It's responsible for a lot of things, including all of the movements that push food through the digestive system. When you feel really upset, your stomach can feel unsettled because it really is moving strangely. If you interpret that feeling as 'sick,' you won't have a lot of drive to put more food in there. If you interpret that feeling as 'hunger,' you'll want to put more food in there.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, the explanation is more complicated than that. There is a lot of emerging research around the role of the gut biome in mental illnesses. Depression itself generally makes it hard for people to care for themselves, and things like grocery shopping, preparing meals, eating, cleaning up, etc. can be overwhelming. There are all sorts of disordered eating habits that might come into play, like relying on food for self-soothing/comfort. Depression can be a pit of apathy, so people may not care enough to eat or may not care enough about themselves to eat well. There is probably a little of everything involved.</p>
<p>*It's already in this post. The depression-serotonin link is more correlation that causation at this point. There is a bunch of newer research that suggests lower serotonin may be a result of depression, not the cause of depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depression causes you to feel sad or numb. Eating can give you a feeling of being &quot;happy&quot;, but it's very short lived. We have a term for it - &quot;comfort food&quot;. So people eat more, and generally unhealthy food.</p>
<p>Or, depression can make you uninterested in normal activities, like eating. It just takes too much effort to make a meal and consume it.</p>
<p>I've experienced both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not attempting an ELI5, but sharing what I learnt from &quot;<em>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</em>&quot; by Robert Sapolsky. Though the explanation is about sustained stressors (physical or psychological), I believe that medical depression is a ceaseless psychological stressor (based on literature and second-hand experiences with family and friends) and hence, could help shed some light.</p>
<p>First, some terminology - People who eat more during stress are called '<em>Hyperphagic</em>' while those whose appetite goes for a toss are termed '<em>Hypophagic</em>'. </p>
<p><strong>Claim?</strong>
Depression can take on a rhythmic nature (less in morning, grows with the day, or reverse). So, the degree of depression varies with time. How often and for how long the coping mechanisms are engaged in the body depends on this. This makes timing critical. If it is a very long bout - it is most likely going to suppress appetite. If it fluctuates rather rapidly, it is more likely to cause people to gorge on food. This might be the case when the person is somehow able to distract himself on to a task that demands concentration. For that while, the body kind of temporarily forgets about the depression and tries to restore the vegetative state. As soon as the task is over, the mind gets back into its low depressive gear and up goes the coping mechanism. The problem is, turning the coping mechanism on is fast, but bringing it back to normal is slow. </p>
<p><strong>The Why?</strong>
Hormones released during onset of stressor (CRH) tend to inhibit appetite. The other hormones that are released as a result of these hormones (like Glucocorticoids) tend to stimulate appetite. During the onset, the suppressors outweigh the effect of stimulators. While we are in the middle of it, there is a tussle between the two as both are present in rather large quantities. Depending on which hormone outweighs the other tends to determine if we'll end up hungry or will lose appetite. During the end, recovery of body starts, so it tries to get more energy to do repairs and construction. Thus, inhibitors are removed from circulation in the body, leading to increased appetite.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't completely accurate as there are many variables that determine the outcome. But it is a decent generalization. To quote Sapolsky &quot;The type of stressor is key to whether the net result is hyper- or hypophagia. Take some crazed, maze-running rat of a human. He sleeps through the alarm clock first thing in the morning, total panic. Calms down when it looks like the commute isn't so bad today, maybe he won't be late for work after all. Gets panicked all over again when the commute then turns awful. Calms down at work when it looks like the boss is away for the day and she didn't notice he was late. Panics all over again when it becomes clear the boss is there and did notice. So it goes throughout the day. And how would that person describe his life? 'I am like, SO stressed, like totally, nonstop stressed, 24/7.' But that's not like totally nonstop stressed. Take a whole body burn. <em>That's</em> like totally nonstop stressed, 24/7. What this first person is actually experiencing is frequent <em>intermittent stressors.</em>&quot; And what's going on hormonally in that scenario? Frequent bursts of CRH release throughout the day. As a result of the slow speed at which glucocorticoids are cleared from the circulation, elevated glucocorticoid levels are close to nonstop. Guess who's going to be scarfing up Krispy Kremes all day at work?</p>
<p>So a big reason why most of us become hyperphagic during stress is our westernized human capacity to have intermittent psychological stressors throughout the day.</p>
<p>Another variable  that helps predict hyperphagia or hypophagia during stress is how your body responds to a particular stressor.&quot; The roots of this may lie in reasons well before you were even conceived. So, that's a long story. </p>
<p>Also, hyperphagics don't just eat more but crave a particular type of food - sweets (comfort foods). Glucocorticoids not only stimulate appetite, but appetite of a certain type of food, and also where it is to be stored - abdominal fat. Why? &quot;...based on some fascinating recent work by Mary Dallman from the University of California at San Francisco: consuming lots of those comfort foods and bulking up on abdominal fat are stress-reducers.&quot;</p>

It's very similar to why some people develop binge eating disorder and some develop anorexia; the underlying cause is similar but the coping skill is different. The unconscious can either want to bury feelings with food or starve them out in an effort to avoid them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
