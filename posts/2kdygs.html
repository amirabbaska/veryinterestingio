		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks everyone for the interesting comments. I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Summary of the answers:</p>
<p>*Current batteries are based on lithium-ion technology which was developed a very long time ago so it is now very mature. Mature technologies won't change that much more or get that much cheaper.</p>
<p>*Li-Ion battery technology has actually improved considerably in the past two decades. Progress has slowed recently.

<p>*Modern smartphones and other consumer electronic devices also use a lot more power which cancels out the improvements in the battery.</p>
<p>*The trend in consumer electronics is towards smaller and thinner devices so the size of the battery must also be reduced. Smaller batteries hold less charge.</p>
<p>*New batteries based on more promising materials take a lot of time to go from the lab to a commercial product due to concerns about safety.</p>
<p>*Media often over states and hypes new battery developments.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine!  There are a few reasons this is the case.  I hold a Masters degree in battery science (well, it's really a Chemistry degree), and worked as a battery scientist for three years.  I posted an explanation to a similar question in a different thread and I've posted it below.  The only thing worth adding is that a lot of people are talking about cost.  Cost has been made out to be a big issue in this thread, but it's actually even worse than that.  I would routinely spend the equivalent of $20-$30 per sample when I was doing research, and that was for a tiny square capable of storing minute amounts of power.  THEN it has to be proven that it can be scaled up into a functional product, and THEN engineered to be inexpensive.</p>
<p>My response from three months ago is below:</p>
<p>Batteries don't &quot;do&quot; what most other electronic pieces can do. There aren't any transistors to shrink or moving parts to remove, so you generally can't develop smaller, slimmer batteries with technological improvements the way you can develop electronics. How useful a battery is to us is almost entirely based on how much energy it can store (how it stores it may also be important, but not for the purposes of any discussion we're likely to have here), and how much energy it can store is entirely based on the physics and chemistry of the materials used to make it. You can't change the laws of physics, so a battery built with a particular chemistry will always have a maximum amount of energy it's capable of storing per cubic centimeter (or by whatever method of measuring you prefer to use).</p>
<p>Scientists are pretty good at predicting what sorts of materials are needed to improve things. A scientist could sit down and say &quot;if I had a material that could [Insert Property Here], I could make this so much better&quot;. Creating those materials, or processing them in a way that makes your vision a reality, is the hard part. Battery technology improves much more slowly than most other fields because you can't just refine and make a smaller version of one - you have to develop some new chemistry that allows you to store more energy. It's actually been more practical in recent years to work on developing technology that just consumes less electricity.</p>
<p>The first problem with developing something better than current battery technology is that right now we're moving energy around primarily with Lithium and Carbon, which are two of the lightest best-packed elements on the periodic table. We've effectively reached the limit of what traditional chemistry alone is capable of doing.</p>
<p>The second problem is that storing lots of energy in small spaces is inherently unsafe. It's no good to have chemistry that lets me store lots of energy tightly if it's liable to release that energy violently at the slightest jostle. I drop my phone occasionally, and I'd prefer that it didn't explode when I do. Chemistry happens differently at different temperatures, so it's also important if the chemical reaction releases the most juice between 0-40 degrees Celsius because otherwise it wouldn't be practical for us to walk around with.</p>
<p>What all of this means is that someone has to go forward to create materials and structures that don't exist using methods that haven't been thought of in order to create a new electrochemical reaction that may or may not actually be safe and reasonable to use.</p>
<p>There's a lot of time and energy invested into every step, and so batteries progress very slowly. Batteries are also a fairly recent &quot;problem&quot;. People may have wished for longer lasting batteries in devices over the last century, but only in the last decade has the total population had a battery in their pocket at all times. When something significantly, obviously and proven better comes along than our current options, you can count on it being adopted fairly fast.</p>
<p>EDIT - clarity</p>
<p>EDIT#2 - you guys ask a lot of great questions.  I love when people get excited over batteries and will do my part to keep interest up.  Unfortunately, I had a super busy day, so I haven't been able to respond to many of you.  I'm trying to make sure I get to everyone who sent me a message, it just might take me a little time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though a researcher may have developed a new battery it is not cost effective. That new battery may last an extra 4 hours but it costs twice as much compared to the old battery. Lets say an old battery lasts 6 hours, it would be more cost efficient to just buy two old batteries which would give me 12 hours while the new battery would cost the same it would only provide 10 hours. </p>
<p>Since the new batteries havent become affordable yet, no corporation would implement it in their products. Also it isnt affordable for the consumers.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of safety, even though they have developed the battery they still have to do safety tests. A lot of these new battery technology are developed in labs, which are often in ideal settings, so researchers have to make these products able to handle the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else has said, battery technology has improved amazingly. They use this technology to make phones that are more powerful and thinner. They still only last a day, because people prefer phones that are more powerful and thinner, not last longer.</p>
<p>Modern cell phones are coming out with 3200mah batteries at 3.8v, or 12.2 watt-hours. Compare to two AA batteries, 2000mah at 3v, or 6 watt-hours. Can you imagine if your phone used 4 AA batteries every charge, and how big that would be to carry around?</p>
<p>There are RC helicopter batteries out now the size of a pack of cigarettes that can produce 300 amps of power. That's as much as a car battery that weighs 20 pounds.</p>
<p>I have some battery modules out of a 2012 Nissan Leaf that are the size of a stack of printer paper, and it holds 500 watt-hours of energy. It's 7.6v, 60,000mah. That's crazy. And, it can be quck charged in something like a half hour. That's insane. I remember growing up we were using Ni-Cad AA batteries that were 1.2 volts, 500mah, and took all night to charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great answers here, but let me put another reason out there: lots of journalists have no idea how to evaluate the claims made by the (English major running the PR department of the) battery company. The company has an interest in making sure that the article you read is as favorable to the company as possible, so that the company will be perceived as more profitable and the stock price will rise. The journalist writing the article may have no science or engineering training or experience at all. That means that the journalist can't do much except repeat the claims made by the battery manufacturer. Finally, the journalist's editor has an interest in writing the biggest, most exciting headline he reasonably can, because he thinks that will make you more likely to read the article.</p>
<p>So there are two people in this process (the editor and the manufacturer) who want to portray this as the biggest, most exciting advance in a decade, two people (the journalist and the editor) who may not have the qualifications to actually evaluate what the manufacturer says, and no one at all with an actual interest in writing an accurate and unbiased report on this battery. So the article you read is full of inflated claims.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Price. You will see some of these new battery technologies in commercial uses in which it would make sense to spend extra money. I work in a data center and I have seen some new battery technologies implemented into battery backups systems for servers. Some shit is just so critical that it would ruin a company if it went down for even a couple minutes. It would make sense to spend a couple extra thousand dollars on a newer technology. On the other hand, it would make absolutely no sense to spend so much extra money on a phone battery just so you could Facebook for a couple extra hours. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
