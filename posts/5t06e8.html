<p>I'm just wondering why money values have the larger symbols ahead of their money, but the lesser values always come after?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a quick glance tactic to avoid mistakes.  If there is not a 0 and a decimal written before the number, one might actually misread ¢50 as $50 or vice versa, so the ¢ was after the amount.  This was more prevalent in days of handwritten books as the two symbols were really only one curved stroke apart from each other.  However, the presence of the 0 and decimal point can work just fine in electronic spreadsheet modernization.  $0.50 is much more largely considered acceptable today as it's usually a computer doing the calculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you put the dollar (or pounds sterling, or whatever) in front, it keeps some one from adding a number infront of that. If you put the cent (or pence) after, it becomes obvious when it goes from 50p to 150p. Easy red flag, and far less expensive to the person whos check is being forged than 50$ turning into 150$. So we pu it in front $50.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read before that it's a historical holdover from when everything was handwritten. It would have been extremely easy to add a digit, at the least a 1 in front of a value and defraud someone. Putting the $ sign at the beginning eliminates this because at worst someone could tack .99 onto the end of a dollar value. Same reason you put the little squiggly line in the area behind the value you write on a check.</p>
<p>This could all be made up (not the squiggly line part, that's legit) but it seems more palusible to me personally than anything else in this thread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
