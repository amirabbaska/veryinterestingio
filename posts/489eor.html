		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The age of NYC (it's been settled for ~400 years) and the tunnels mean that you run into all kinds of tunnels, utility pipes, and other objects that you don't know are there. This, combined with the fact that you have one of the most densely populated cities in the world above it makes construction both difficult and dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason NYC can have so many tall buildings is that the island of Manhattan is essentially one huge slab of granite bedrock, as opposed to most cities on the water, which have relatively mud-like soil. This is very slow, difficult, and expensive to tunnel through, though it makes for better tunnels in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the danger associated with this work the labor unions have demanded high wages to offset the potential risk to workers, making for very high construction costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New York City is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. Everything, from a cup of coffee to building a subway tunnel, is going to be significantly more expensive then just about anywhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>Big cities, and New York City in general, are known for a ton of red tape being involved in construction projects, which increases the costs significantly.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems like some of the other posts have answered this pretty well but as someone who walks past this site everyday, the thing that I'm amazed by is the lengths they go to to keep traffic flowing on 2nd Ave. They dig up half the street and keep the other half open to traffic. They do what they need to do underground then close up that half, rebuild the street on top, open it to traffic and then work in the other side. When they're done, they close that side up, rebuild the street and go back to the first side again. They've probably gone back and forth like 4 times. They could probably save a few bucks if they could just open the whole thing up at once and do everything they need to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of very hard and dangerous construction conditions and very powerful labor unions. I recently read that there is one portion of this tunnel that has an abandoned subway tunnel, a bunch of underground infrastructure, a busy street, an above ground rail, and massive fucking buildings above it. Before they could move forward, they had to install a huge frame to support the weight so the tunnel doesn't collapse and bring a NYC block down with it. In another instance, they hit a silty, sandy aquifer instead of what was supposed to be solid rock, flooding a good portion of the dig. They had to bring in divers to find the leak and seal it. </p>
<p>Given the high risk of injury and death, the labor unions insisted on super high pay. Combine this with the red tape and seedy connections big city construction has to deal with, and you end up with probably the highest construction labor wages in the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
