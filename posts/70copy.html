		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be a simple explanation, but probably not for a 5-year-old.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that math is about numbers and computing things.  Like, solve this equation, multiply these numbers, find the value of that side, etc.  But that's not right.  Really, math is about <em>understanding</em> things.  Math is about <em>how</em> things work and <em>why</em> they work.  Different branches of math are about how and why different types of things work.  For example, arithmetic is about how operations with numbers work.  Algebra is about how solving basic equations works.  Geometry is about how shapes work.  Etc.  Well, calculus is about how really tiny things relate to one another and how they come together to make normal-sized things.</p>
<p>When I was really little, I knew how to count and add and such.  I liked to play with Legos, and my dad taught me how to multiply with Legos.  So a 4x4 piece had 16 dots -- I could see the 4 rows of 4 dots each, and I could count the 16.  So that's how you multiply.  And that's also how to get the area of a rectangle.  I understood those before I was 5; it was pretty easy!  So it's clearly not so far-fetched for a 5-year-old to understand a little arithmetic and geometry, right?  So why not a little calculus?</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand a little calculus is to sit in the middle seat and look at the speedometer in the car.  What speed does it say?  Maybe it says 31 miles per hour.  This means that, if you keep traveling at this speed, you'll go 31 miles in an hour.  Any kid can understand that (even if the kid doesn't really know how far a mile is).  But then your dad slows down and stops at a red light.  The speed is 0 miles per hour now.  Did you actually go 31 miles in an hour?  No; 31 miles per hour was your speed only at that instant in time.  Now the speed is different.  The idea that it even makes sense to <em>have</em> a speed at an instant in time is... calculus!  You calculate speed by seeing how far you go and dividing by how long it took you to get there, but that only gives you <em>average</em> speed.  For the speed <em>right now</em>, you have to see how far you go in a very, very, very tiny amount of time.  You only go a very, very, very tiny distance.  And you divide by that very, very, very tiny amount of time to get a speed in numbers that you understand.  Calculus is when you make that amount of time tinier and tinier and tinier, and that makes the distance tinier and tinier and tinier too, so that, at that moment, the tiny distance divided by the tiny time is 31 miles per hour, but a second later it might be 30 mph or 32 mph or something else.</p>
<p>You generally use calculus to talk about how fast things change -- in the case of the car, it's how fast your position changes, but lots of things can change.  How fast something is changing <em>right now</em> is called the <em>derivative</em>.  Sometimes you know how the rate of change for something is related to other things.  For example, if you have a weight on a spring, you can write how fast the <em>speed</em> of the weight is changing based on its position on the spring, and you can write an equation called a differential equation.</p>
<p>(I'll show you an example that's way above ELI5, so you can skip it if you want: Hooke's Law says that the force F = –kx, where k is some number and x is the position away from the spring's equilibrium.  Newton's Second Law says that F = ma, where m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration.  Acceleration is how fast the speed -- well, actually, velocity, but let's not get confusing -- changes over time, and speed is how fast the position changes over time.  So the speed v = x', where ' indicates a derivative with respect to time, and a = v', so a = x'', called a second derivative.  Since F = ma and F = –kx, we get mx'' = –kx, and we want to solve for x as a function of time.  This is a differential equation.  The solution is x(t) = Acos(wt) + Bsin(wt), where A and B can be any numbers, and w = sqrt(k/m).  In order to figure out A and B, you need to know how the weigh starts out.  If the weight starts at the equilibrium position and it's not moving, then it's not going to start moving, right?  A = B = 0.  That's boring!  But if the weight starts at x = 5 at rest, then A = 5 and B = 0.  There are lots of possibilities.  How did I solve this?  Calculus!  Not going to get into it here.)</p>
<p>You can also use calculus to talk about how lots of little things can add up to a big thing.  For example, let's say you have an object, and you want to know how much it weighs.  You can break it up into tiny little pieces, figure out the density for each piece, figure out how much each little piece weighs, and add them all together.  That's calculus!  (Or you can just put it on a scale -- that's physics.)</p>
<p>The calculus of how fast things change is called <em>differential calculus</em>, and the calculus of adding up lots of little things is called <em>integral calculus</em>.  In differential calculus, you take a tiny little number and divide by another tiny little number to get a regular-sized number.  In integral calculus, you add together a very, very, very <em>large</em> number of tiny little numbers to get a regular-sized number.</p>
<p>Now, actually <em>doing</em> calculus is much more advanced, but it's not actually <em>hard</em>.  You basically just memorize a bunch of formulas.  For example, the derivative with respect to x of x^n is n·x^(n – 1).  When you need to take a derivative, most of the time you can just use that rule and similar rules.  There are a bunch of them, but they're not hard to learn.  There are rules about taking the derivative of stuff multiplied together or added together or divided one by the other, and even when you have a function of a function.  It's actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it!  Integrals, it turns out, are the inverse of derivatives, so you have a different set of rules but they're just the opposite of the rules for derivatives (for example, ∫x^(n)dx = x^(n + 1)/(n + 1) + C; it's just the opposite of the derivative rule -- never mind the C for now).  But the rules for multiplication and such are much more difficult, so a lot of the time you just <em>can't</em> take a nice-looking integral, not because you don't know how but because it's actually not possible without inventing new math (for example, people couldn't figure out how to do ∫dx/ln(x), so they just made up a new function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_integral_function" target="_blank">li(x)</a> to be the answer).  There are quite a lot of rules for taking integrals, but in the end, it's not really very difficult.  You just have to learn how to do it, that's all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of people here talking about finding slopes and rates, and all of this is correct. There's also people mentioning the area or space under a curve/surface, which is also calculus.</p>
<p>All of this is true, but I want to add something that gets at the beauty of calculus a bit more, and doesn't even require notion of functions!</p>
<p>At its heart, calculus is the relationship between change (ie. rates, slopes, differentials) and content (ie. volume, area, distance, etc). It's a field that connects how big something is to how much it grows when small changes are made or, conversely, how knowing the rate that something is changing can tell you how much &quot;stuff&quot; you've accumulated.</p>
<p>For example, pretend you're in a vehicle where you can't see out the window. The only thing you can see in the car is the speedometer. As the car drives, you can keep track of the speedometer at every point in time and you'll know how much distance the car has traveled without being able to measure the distance of the car's path.</p>
<p>I think it's beautiful that calculus connects two seemingly unrelated: change and content. This is what math is in general though - it is the study of taking seemingly disparate things in the world and showing that they are fundamentally connected.</p>
<p>Edit: added a small point on functions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic principle behind calculus is fairly easy to understand.  Imagine painting the walls around a round ship window.  It's got that neat brass stuff, and you don't want to paint that so you have masking tape. </p>
<p>So how do use straight masking tape on a round window?  You use some small strips.   You can start with some big ones like the yellow in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vnS2jMb.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.  Well, that doesn't look right at all.  You didn't paint close to the circle, and nobody likes it.  Boss man gives you a second chance.  OK, you use smaller strips and your outline is more like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pEJWT6H.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. Much better!  </p>
<p>Now using the smaller straight strips were much better approximation to the actual window, but they were not perfect.  To be perfect we need super tiny strips, and once they are absolutely tiny, they are perfectly accurate. </p>
<p>Calculus breaks things down into those tiny strips to accurately measure curvey things.  It works for straight things too, but kinda overkill.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calculus one (differential calculus) primarily deals with finding how quickly something is changing at any given time. E.g. Given a position of an object for some time interval, we can find how fast it was moving during any moment in that interval. We do this by finding derivatives of functions.</p>
<p>Calculus two (integral calculus) deals with finding area/volume. E.g. given the velocity of an object over some time interval, we can find how far it has traveled by finding the area underneath its velocity vs time curve. We do this by finding integrals of functions.</p>
<p>Calculus three (multivariate) deals with calculus in three dimensions. Finding the path that water might travel down a complicated hill, the volume of a three dimensional object, the circulation of fluid along a curve, or the flux of a liquid across a surface are a number of applications. It's ultimately the most useful in complicated engineering problems since the real world is three dimensions.</p>
<p>Some related fields are analysis and differential equations. The former is more about establishing the theory that allows us to perform basic calculus, and the latter deals with equations involving the relation of certain quantities and their derivatives (big in physics).</p>
<p>Edit: a taste of how calc 1 and 2 are done:</p>
<p>Calc 1: So imagine you use a microscope to zoom in on a curve. The more you zoom the more the curve looks like a line. Theoretically, if you zoom in infinitely you see a line. The slope of that line is equal to the rate of change of the curve. So if you plot the graph of an objects position (given by our curve) and zoom in on that curve a lot, it looks linear. The slope of that line is the object's velocity at that position. That is calc 1</p>
<p>Calc 2: The idea is to subdivide some closed region (think like an amoeba) into rectangles and use the formula for area of rectangles to find area under/inside a curve. We use two processes. The first is called limits (to make the rectangle width approach 0, which causes the error in our approximation to approach 0. Think about approximating a circle as a square. When we divide the circle up into more squares, our shape becomes closer to a circle and our error in approximation approaches 0. Let these squares approach infinitely small size.) Then we sum their areas using our rectangle area formula through a second process, which is called summation. This is Calc 2</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In algebra you learned to calculate the slope of a straight line.</p>
<p>What's the slope of a curved line?  Well, it's not just one number.  It changes - it's higher when the curved line is steeper and lower when the curved line is flatter.  You can actually graph this out and get a second line, the graph of the slope of the first line.  Calculus is the set of mathematical tools that allow you to relate the first line to the second line: how to calculate one given the other, and so on.</p>
<p>It's quite handy for stuff like physics.  For example, you may have an equation for your velocity and need to know your acceleration.  Acceleration is the slope of velocity, so you use calculus to find that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
