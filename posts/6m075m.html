<p>The actual procedure is simple. A small incision is made and the device inserted and the skin is sealed with a stich or glue to allow the skin to heal over and seal it in. </p>
<p>It can help prevent menstration by preventing the body from ovulating and shedding the uterine lining monthly lile it does normally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because it's been around for years.  There are tons of options for hormonal birth control for women.  There's the implant, there are patches that stick to your body, a shot that you can get every x number of months, an IUD that lasts up to 5 years, the NuvaRing that you insert and change out once a month, and more varieties of birth control pill than you can shake a stick at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Australia, it's called Implanon.</p>
<p>The biggest thing is that everyone reacts completely differently to it. So I would try the pill first and see how your reaction to hormones is, and consult closely with your doctor. </p>
<p>Mine was $30, a little rod in your arm and lasts 3-5 years. The first month I got it was complete hell - a never ending 3 week period and complete crabbiness and awful cramps. After that it was completely perfect - this was two years ago and I haven't had a period since. </p>
<p>The actual procedure was easier than a flu shot - just a numbing shot and then a small hole in which the device is inserted. Make sure you find a good doctor for this, as all sorts of issues can arise if it is inserted incorrectly. </p>
<p>For my circumstances it worked really well - I travel a lot and would always forget the routine of taking the pill. There's no room for human error. Naturally I have a short period but awful cramps, and I don't think I could ever go back to experiencing that once a month. Also I think it's funny to let people feel it in my arm. </p>
<p>That being said, an implant won't do that for everyone, and it's a bigger commitment than the pill.  You would have to be willing to put up with a rocky few months - for some it never settles down. But it was completely life changing for me - no worries about getting pregnant, getting my period, having hormonal swings and the savings are incredible. Not sure if it is this cheap everywhere else, but even at 10x the price the value is obvious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use the nuvaring continuously instead of taking a week off, as both birth control and to not have a period.</p>
<p>The fact is, there is NO medical reason to have a period.</p>
<p>The only reason birth control pills and the nuvaring tell you to take a week to have your period is because when the pill was invented doctors didn't think women would take it unless it &quot;mimicked the regular menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So basically it's a PR thing.  Women think they HAVE to have a period when in fact they don't at all!</p>
<p>I think it's totally nuts to have a period when you don't have to.</p>
<p>Also, after not having a period for 2 years due to continuous birth control, I then stopped taking it so I could get pregnant, got pregnant the first month, had 2 babies in two years, and then got right back on the birth control....</p>
<p>So it did not effect my fertility at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
