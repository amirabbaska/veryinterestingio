		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual (former) Hollywood union sound editor here.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this. Many of the reasons listed here are correct. Audiences really don't accept a lot of the more realistic effects like punches and gun handling, etc. But consider this: the job of sound effects people is not to make it sound realistic - it's to make it come alive for the viewer. So like, when you see a movie without these &quot;hyperreal&quot; sound effects, it often falls flat. Realistic punches sound dumb. Realistic gun handling doesn't underscore the menace the gun brings to the scene. You can tell more about a character's state of mind by how shaky they hold a gun or how &quot;heavy&quot; it feels to the viewer. Stuff like that.</p>
<p>Sound, even when unrealistic, adds a critical 3rd dimension to the image. It's not just accompanying the picture, it's part of the experience and as important to the picture. Without it, the movie doesn't come off the screen and come alive. </p>
<p>So sound design can do great things. It can create acoustical space where there is none, it can add menace or tension to a scene through the targeted use of important effects, it can make things funnier, it can make things less funny. It can speed up and slow down the pacing of scenes. It can &quot;sell&quot; moments in films that would otherwise go unnoticed (this is often the reason why some otherwise random effect gets highlighted so much - without the effect you don't notice that the character is holding that object or whatever).</p>
<p>To that end, sound is like punctuation or underlining/italicizing text. You can use it to create rhythm and pace and mood, etc. and to highlight important story points or character points.</p>
<p>I agree that a lot of films overdo it, because oftentimes the notes from the studio are &quot;louder louder louder&quot; and a lot of the subtle work that sound designers do to create mood and tone goes away in the name of &quot;big.&quot; But if you study great sound design in films you can begin to appreciate the great work sound design does to add to a film's texture. </p>
<p>Some movies like Fight Club make the conscious decision to dial it back, and that's cool too. There's not right or wrong way to do it, it's all about the choices you want to make creatively.</p>
<p>And I would finally add that we accept ALL SORTS OF UNREALISTIC visual things, from crazy wire-fu stunts that would never happen that way in real life to insane CGI that doesn't move like the real thing would. So if you're going to hold sound to that level of realistic scrutiny, don't forget to do it for picture too :)</p>
<p>EDIT TO ADD: For a great definitive work about designing movies for sound and thinking of sound as a series of creative choices instead of merely representing real things, I recommend Randy Thom's excellent paper on the subject here: <a href="http://filmsound.org/articles/designing_for_sound.htm" target="_blank">http://filmsound.org/articles/designing_for_sound.htm</a></p>
<p>EDIT 2: wow, thanks for the gold! This made my day. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" target="_blank">The Coconut Effect</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best example of this effect are the sound of horse-hooves. From the days of radio, banging two coconut halves together was the standard way to generate the sound effect of horse-hooves. Anyone who has ever actually been around a horse knows that horse-hooves rarely sound like this unless they're on a hard surface like concrete or pavement. All the same, the sound became so ingrained in the public consciousness that even when it later became possible to insert much more realistic sound effects, the coconut sound effect was still used. The audience wouldn't accept horse hooves making a sound not generated by coconuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically we're so used to things making those sounds in movies, that anything else will sound &quot;unrealistic&quot; to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're clich√©s; it's not that they did market research, but that audiences have come to expect them. They add to the drama and excitement, they just detract from the realism.</p>
<p>So, for example, in real life, a fist hitting a face doesn't make that &quot;doosh!&quot; noise it does in the movies. But that noise is, for the audience, a signal, a kind of shorthand way of saying: that guy's fist connected with that other guy's face with a great deal of force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, gleaned from QI: when there are frogs croaking in a Hollywood movie, they always go &quot;ribbit, ribbit&quot;, so everybody grew accustomed to the idea that frogs go &quot;ribbit&quot;, even though only one species (out of thousands) does: the Southern Pacific Tree frog (found in, you guessed it, Hollywood hills). The other ones simply go &quot;kwaaak&quot;. We've been so ingrained hearing this sound from movies at an early age that we have come to believe it's the &quot;standard&quot; frog call.</p>
<p>Edit for those who don't know the ribbit sound: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Gkn9hvejY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Gkn9hvejY</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People don't realize how powerful sound is as a dramatic effect. And that is how they use it. It's why guns click when somebody points it at your favourite character and why everyone cocks a gun that should already be chambered right before a bloodbath. It's why all swords have that sparkle and <em>shing</em> sound when the fighter takes his stance. </p>
<p>Because, in essence it creates an effect. When you see everyone cocking their guns or the tires squeal, you tense up because you think in your head &quot;shits about to get real&quot;. </p>
<p>Same thing with punch sound effects and bullet effects. You think a bullet makes a thwomp sound when it hits a body? You hear the sound of punches because it's more powerful to HEAR what that dudes fist did to the other guy than it would be if the sound wasn't there. Come on, a lot of hand to hand fights wouldn't be half as badass without those effects. </p>
<p>They manipulate the ignorance of the masses with these things in film and TV for dramatic effect and it works. And honestly I like it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
