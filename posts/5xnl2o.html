		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I was on a youtube video watching spree today, and I ended up on animal mating behavior.  What struck me is that when humans have sex there is a lot of movement, sound and communication going on, while for other mammals (even primates) it's a very short, silent affair. Why is human mating so different?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, it has to do with the fact that humans are hyper-social animals. We have massive portions of our brains dedicated to social interaction, communication, and relationships. Having long, intimate rounds of intimacy helps us form long-lasting social bonds, bonds which are critical to the survival of our species. Humans are very weak compared to other species in almost every regard excluding physical endurance and intelligence. Good sex thus sensibly includes aspects that show our evolutionary fitness in other areas as well.</p>
<p>For other animals, there's no reason to expend the extra energy for long-duration mating if they can avoid, as they can't gain from it in the ways we can. That said, humans aren't the only animals that have foreplay; it's just that to us, animal foreplay looks a lot like dancing/strutting around. Their dances/behaviors/etc. show that they're fit in other ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Animal behavior and psychology degrees) Something related that few people are mentioning: Humans have significant incentives to induce <strong>orgasm</strong> in females while mating. Besides strengthening social bonds (not only in mating pairs, since there's evidence that early humans were promiscuous instead of solidly monogamous), female orgasm actually increases the likelihood of conception by repositioning the uterus and cervix for optimal sperm uptake. So there was enough evolutionary advantage to this that it affected our mating behavior long-term. Spending extra time and effort to please the female (a) strengthened important social bonds, and (b) gave the male's sperm a better chance at reaching the egg, which was important in a promiscuous species. A few other species of mammals have female orgasm as well, for basically the same reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Adding a bonus fact. Female humans' concealed ovulation also plays into this. You can't tell when we're in heat, and we are (for the most part) sexually available and active at all times, even during menstruation and pregnancy. This is different from most female mammals, some of whom are only sexually available for one day out of the year. Concealed ovulation had a ton of consequences that made humans how we are today, or so many scientists think. But in relation to this question, it meant males had to mate with females constantly to ensure pregnancy (not just a one-off), and this may have also led to the advantage given to males who spend the effort to induce orgasm in females.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Bonobos have the art of using sex as a social/bonding experience down better than humans do. Even more sex just for fun, a good deal of it homosexual. Not terribly noisy either, though, they communicate mostly non-verbal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>False premise. You really haven't been exposed to much animal sex I'm guessing. The first time you hear two galapagos tortoises banging their shells together while the male groans so loud you can hear it on the other side of the zoo for 15+ minutes straight. Well... you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A professor from my first degree in biology theorized that at some point humanity first figured out the act of sex leads to children as we became more aware and then we figured out childbirth quite often lead to death. He figured that the humans that got pleasure from sex would be more likely to take that risk. Give it thousands of years and you end up with a whole species that can get pleasure from sex as that's more likely to get passed on more frequently. </p>
<p>Everything else stemmed from that.  Forming attachment to what makes you happy, relationships got stronger, stress relieved, etc.</p>
<p>I don't think he published anything on it, he was more concerned with sustainable hydroponic fish farms he'd build in Africa. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
