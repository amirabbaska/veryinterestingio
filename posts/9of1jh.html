		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>A cigarette is made of dried and fine tobacco leaves wrapped in thin paper while pipe tobacco is made of coarse tobacco leaves placed in pipes for smoking.</li>
<li>A cigarette has two flavors, regular and menthol while pipe tobacco has many flavors, ranging from spicy to fruity to sweet.</li>
<li>The flavor and aroma of cigarettes are added chemically while the flavor and aroma of pipe tobacco are added while the plant is still growing by spraying them on the leaves.</li>
<li>Pipe tobacco is more natural and is safer to smoke than cigarettes which have added chemicals.
However they can both cause lung and mouth cancer from exposure to chemicals and carbon monoxide in the smoke.</li>
<li>Vape is better. </li>
<li>Quitting is best. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad has smoked a pipe since I can remember. Always smokes Carter Hall. I absolutely love the smell of the tobacco, before it’s smoked. It’s fruity and sweet. The smell of pipe smoke is one of my favorite smells, just because it reminds me of my dad. It’s terrible for you, but whenever I get the rare treat of seeing him, I always go outside with him when he smokes it! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit of history: smoking pipes and cigars used to be common. You use a decent to excellent tobacco leaf, process it carefully, and sell it for a high price. Eventually, some enterprising soul thought &quot;we throw out tons of shitty trimmings and subpar leaves. Why don't we sell them?&quot;</p>
<p>Very quickly, the waste product became the major source of revenue. These days, over 90% of tobacco is used in cigarettes, and cigars and pipe tobacco have become a premium product. </p>
<p>Cigarettes are dried, and chemicals are added to keep them burning longer once lit, which means that it takes almost no skill, and there's limited flavour. It's just burning leaves. </p>
<p>Pipes and cigars are very different - the leaves are a higher grade, with tobaccos selected based on flavour, like wine. Some leaves are richer, others milder, and each type will be blended to be similar over time. Sometimes flavours are added (common with pipe tobacco more so than cigars). </p>
<p>Proper storage is crucial. You want the right amount of humidity, not too much or too little, or it will spoil. But the key is that it takes a certain amount of wealth and effort to smoke these, because they're the premium product. If you don't want to put in that effort, you smoke cigarettes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a sideways answer to your question.  In California, when they finally went after bulk tobacco and the price went from 20ish a pound to 65ish a pound (for the most economical stuff), there almost immediately appeared bags of bulk tobacco with the words &quot;Pipe Tobacco&quot; on them - I continued rolling smokes with this indistinguishable from bags that didn't say that tobacco, and that remains the case to this day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I smoked cigs till I had heart stents. 2003. Then I quit for a year and started dipping Skoal. I stopped dipping 3 years ago and started vaping on 26mg Nicotine. Now down to 12mg. Another year and I’ll be vaping 0 mg. Why not quit vaping? Calms my nerves. I’ll be retiring in a couple and then the devil’s lettuce will be my friend. Can’t do it now because of work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
