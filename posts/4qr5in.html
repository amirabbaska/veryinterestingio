		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called cold welding or vacuum welding.  Richard Feynman explains it as such:
&quot;The reason for this unexpected behavior is that when the atoms in contact are all of the same kind, there is no way for the atoms to “know” that they are in different pieces of copper. When there are other atoms, in the oxides and greases and more complicated thin surface layers of contaminants in between, the atoms “know” when they are not on the same part.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a blacksmith/amateur metallurgy nut who does a lot of solid-state diffusion bonding to make pattern-welded steel, this blows my mind and creates so many questions! I've realized for years that getting solid-state diffusion bonding to happen requires extra energy added to the system in one way or another (I primarily use heat to get steels to come together), but it never occurred to me that the the extra energy required would be in part to overcome the issues of dissimilar materials at the interface. I'm used to being able to trade the TYPE of energy required back and forth to get bonding to occur. For example, a gentleman named <a href="http://www.meiersteel.com/" target="_blank">Daryl Meier</a> once demonstrated solid state welding of dissimilar steels at ~1100F (IIRC) by using a large impact force (a big power hammer) to force the process along. Traditionally we do this type of welding at 2000-2200F. </p>
<p>For those here who might have more knowledge of the process, can anybody answer any of the following?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the materials involved need to be elementally pure? Like, will this only work with 100% pure iron to 100% pure iron, or would it be possible to get an iron alloyed crystaline lattice (say, with a smidge of C, Mn, W, etc. added) to bond this way?</li>
<li>If it's possible with different alloys, would the same types of &quot;rules&quot; hold true here as we see in high-temp bonding? For example, in steel, higher carbon levels allow for dolid-state welding at lower temperatures.</li>
<li>What about dissimilar materials that will form solid-state bonds with heat (E.g. the Japanese Mokume Gane techniques use to bond silver/gold/copper alloys/etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to think that as long as the electrons of the constituent atoms would be free to be shared between the two materials that it would work, but I'm not good enough at physics or chemistry to REALLY grok this.</p>
<p>Thanks reddit! I have something new to eat my brain now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has already explained the &quot;hows&quot;: I just wanted to point out that it doesn't have to be in space, or even in a vacuum chamber. It's just the absolute absence of other atoms that is important.</p>
<p>Cold welding also happens in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulation-displacement_connector" target="_blank">insulation-displacement connectors</a> under STP.*</p>
<p>*although I suppose <em>technically</em> you could argue that the welding surfaces are under a hard vacuum as defined by the absence of any gas molecules, but the volume of space under vacuum would be zero. I've never heard of someone using the term &quot;vacuum&quot; to describe such a scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give a bit of intuition - this shouldn't be at all surprising.  People remember from middle school about the ductility of metals - you can push a metal rod through a shallow funnel and it'll basically shear the metal on the edges and spread it out, giving you a thinner rod as you draw it through.  This is normally done at hotter temperatures for efficiency, but it doesn't have to be.  Aluminum cans undergo a drawing process using dies - <a href="https://youtu.be/hUhisi2FBuw?t=1m48s" target="_blank">it's how aluminium cans are made</a>.  Continually Press it into or through an area too thin, and it'll elongate and thin out.</p>
<p>What's happening while this is occurring?  Metal atoms that were attached to each other <em>can't</em> still be attached to the same atoms they were.  They had to let go of some atoms and reattach to others during the process, like playing with really firm play-doh or silly-putty.</p>
<p>While this is normally done at hotter temperatures for efficiency,   Metal freely exchange electrons at any temperature, which is the basis of chemical bonding.  If you stick two metals together, they'll bond nice and easy; no questions asked.  The only reason metals stays separate on Earth is because virtually every metal forms an oxide layer on contact with the atmosphere, since all these extra electrons zipping around love to be reduced (oxidized).  and an oxidized surface layer no longer has the free electrons to reach out and grab their equally-oxidized buddies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
