		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, while cells can come in various sizes there's something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">Square-Cube law</a> that basically means that the larger an object becomes, its volume grows faster than its surface area. This might sound obvious but because cells have to traffic things into and out of their surfaces in order to process nutrients, the ability to transport becomes a limiting factor as the cells can no longer uptake fuel and get rid of waste fast enough. Bacterial cells are tiny and lack sophisticated transport mechanisms within their cell, they tend to stay small because a lot of their molecular transportation is passive in some way. Eukaryotic cells get around this by having organelles, so they have become more efficient at utilizing resources and as a result, can be bigger. However, eukaryotic cells in general also have an upper limit to size. You might notice that this is the reason why some organelles and cells will become wrinkled heavily (like mitochondria, or even organs like the brain) and that's to increase their surface area to volume ratio.</p>
<p>Elephants get around this limitation by simply just having <em>more</em> cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Cells are rarely larger than 100 microns in the shortest dimension due to fact that diffusional transfer drops steeply with distance (rate proportional to the root of X). Thus, supply of consumables to the most interior cytoplasm sets a limit on diffusional delay and thus distance.</p>
<p>In the course of my medical research at Duke, I dissected single muscle fibers (cells) from small animals such as insects (crickets, bees, flies, waterbugs), medium size (frogs, amphiuma) and large (rabbits, humans). The largest by far were from flight muscle from waterbugs, only 8 cm long. Within a species however, young animals have small diameter fibers which increase in diameter as they 'bulk up' with maturity. Newborn humans about 10 microns, big NFL players in for ACL repair in ortho dept 140 microns, about the same as large specimens of Rana pipiens, the leopard frog. Ribbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about human to elephant but mice cells are indeed smaller than human cells (at least as far as the retina is concerned!). Bare in mind that doesn't mean analogous tissues/organs are just shrunk down with the same number of cells and same proportionate sizes - they are subject to other factors too. </p>
<p>Besides differences arising from them being simply different species, an example of functional constraints can be seen in the mouse lens- it occupies most of the eyeball whereas it is a much smaller proportion in human eyes because physics/refraction </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
