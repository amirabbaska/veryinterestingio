		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That was a long time ago. Fighting together against Germany in WW2 cemented their alliance. Sharing a language and some culture helps maintain the relationship.</p>
<p>Britain is also a relatively strong military power compared to most countries, with nuclear weapons and a permanent seat in the UN security council. It's useful to have them on your side.</p>
<p>A lot of this applies to France too, which is also a close ally of the USA. Maybe the shared language is the reason why the UK is considered to edge out France as the USA's closest ally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Which France? The Kingdom of France, which hooked the U.S. up with a lot of support during the Revolution (as a political move to stick it to Britain)? The Republic of France, which we had an undeclared war at sea with (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War</a>) for trying to claim old debts owed to the guillotined monarchy? Napoleonic France, which sold us a shit ton of land so they could afford to fight everyone in Europe?</p>
<p>The period after the founding of America was a pretty wild one for France. Upheaval after upheaval, revolution, counter-revolution, invasions to and fro, and so on. Britain, meanwhile, sat there and kept being Britain pretty much constantly. They already had a head start in being another English-speaking nation with a lot of overlapping traditions, common law, and so on, and the consistency of government made it a lot easier to form attachments. Then once the 20th century rolled around, America kept finding itself in common fights alongside Britain, which grew from 'allies of convenience' to a more genuine fondness, again assisted by all that stuff they have in common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shared language (English), shared culture (dominated by Anglican/Episcopalian Protestants), mutual trade (look up the volume of trade between the UK and the United States circa 1900), distance (for most of our mutual history the Atlantic was simply too far for either power to threaten the other across), and co-belligerence in two world wars that exhausted the British Empire. Not to mention the fact that George III was not an especially sane or well-loved king and a great deal of the enmity between the two countries was royal pique.</p>
<p>Basically, by the time the United States was big enough to really hurt Britain, or Britain could have plausibly done more than humiliate the United States, the two powers had been getting along decently for some time. A big part of that was reciprocity of needs; London had enormous financial markets, and the United States had vast natural resources. British capital was invested in America, American goods and raw materials fed British industry, rinse, repeat throughout the 19th century. This was well enough established to make war between the two countries distasteful to both as early as the 1860s (when, ironically, Napoleon III was pissing us off quite a bit by intervening in Mexico; by 1867 we were threatening war).</p>
<p>It's the same reason Weimar Germany and Soviet Russia cooperated between 1919 and the Nazi rise to power; Germany had industrial expertise and needed raw material (and somewhere to fool around with tanks in secret), the Soviets had raw materials and needed industrial expertise.</p>
<p>(To answer the obvious question: India is different for a few reasons, even setting aside racism. Great Britain didn't conquer India in one go; they conquered Bengal, and then used local forces to conquer the rest of India in bites. And it was a generational process.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not long after the end of the US war for independence, France went through a regime change and no longer had a monarchy. The old French government was the one that helped the US and created friendly ties with them. The new French government created tensions with the US. Since then, France never really became a close friend to the US until World War 1. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
