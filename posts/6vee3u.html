<p>Also, we are constantly searching the universe for potentially inhabitable planets (i.e., oxygen, h2o rich). Do we know if there are elements similar to these which could allow for human consumption? In other words, what are the odds of an unidentified element that humans could breath that is different than oxygen or drink other than water?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elements are defined by the number of protons in the atom. Hydrogen is one Proton, Helium is 2 protons, lithium is 3 protons, etc.</p>
<p>by definition, there is absolutely no way for there to be elements 'between' the known elements. All other elements have to be <em>after</em>. And the problem with that is the larger a nucleus gets, the more unstable it becomes (broadly speaking). under proper conditions, a high-number atom could be created, but it would self destruct faster than a human could notice its existence. The human would only find out after it had already died, when his machines registered the shower of energetic particles from the rapid decay.</p>
<p>Now, there are variants of elements: You can change its chemical properties by adding or removing electrons (these are called ions), and you can change its density and nuclear properties (such as decay rates) by adding or removing neutrons (these are called isotopes). There are a finite number of possible ions and isotopes for each element.</p>
<p>Elements also combine into a staggering array of compounds. The potential number of combinations is technically infinite, as there is no mandatory end to how many atoms you can bind into the same structure (a perfect crystal is technically a single molecule). This is where you might find exotic extra terrestrial materials. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've discovered all the naturally occurring elements. New elements being discovered are highly unstable, artificial elements that are made in particle accelerators. There are almost certainly no more stable elements to be found. Unless there's another intelligent race playing with particle accelerators somewhere, it's possible that super-heavy elements like those in the Z &gt; 110 range have only ever existed on Earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally, a question on here I can answer (not my job, but this is one of my hobbies). Looks like people have gotten most of it right but hopefully I can add something of value. I'll start by answering your question about the naturally occurring elements on earth.</p>
<p>All elements with atomic number 83 and under (technically, 82, but that's a story for another day) are non-radioactive, with the exception of elements 43 and 61 (technetium and promethium). This means that these 81 elements do not have a &quot;time-limit&quot; on their existence. These 81 elements have all been found in nature, in relatively generous amounts. Hence, our count so far stands at 81 naturally occurring elements.</p>
<p>Elements 90 and 92, Uranium and Thorium, and the only other elements that occur on earth in sizeable amounts on earth. They are radioactive but decay very slowly, and hence can be found in various ores. This brings our count to 83. </p>
<p>All elements we cover from here onwards are produced via radioactive (albeit natural) means (ie, they are &quot;freshly&quot; made). Hence, all atoms on our earth that have been here since the start of time are one of the 83 elements mentioned above.</p>
<p>Elements 43, 61, 84-89 and 91 exist in extremely small amounts on earth, as a result of Uranium occasionally decaying into these elements. You would not be able to get a pile large enough to look at; we're talking tiny amounts. However, it's still &quot;natural&quot;, so our count increases to 92.</p>
<p>Many people will say all elements above 93 are &quot;synthetic&quot;; this is how they were originally discovered, however, it has since been discovered that they <em>do</em> occur naturally, in even smaller amounts that the above set of elements. Basically, in areas of extremely high Uranium ore concentration, a form of nuclear &quot;fusion&quot; can occur that can produce elements from 93 all the way up to 98. This brings our number all the way up to 98.</p>
<p>However, we can go higher and bring this number to a nice round 100, but these two may be considered &quot;controversial&quot;. Normally, a man-made nuclear reactor would be require to produce elements 99 and higher. However, by pure coincidence, an extremely long time ago, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">natural nuclear reactor</a> came in to existence in Oklo, Gabon, Africa, where the conditions were just right (an extremely rare occurrence). There is evidence that this reactor produced Einsteinium and Fermium (99 and 100). However, since these elements have short half-lives, they do not <em>currently</em> exist in nature (and haven't since the natural reactor ran dry; they wouldn't appear on earth again until the 1950s).</p>
<p>Hence, the final answer to your question is 83, 98 or 100, depending on how you define &quot;naturally occurring&quot;. </p>
<p>To answer your second question, the answer simply is: we don't know. The highest observed element anywhere in the universe is 118, which was man-made (and only 4 atoms <em>ever</em> have been observed). It's possible that some stars may produce elements higher than this, but no one has been able to observe any elements even close to 118 while analysing spectral data from stars.</p>
<p>Bonus fact: Element 100 (the &quot;last&quot; &quot;naturally occurring&quot; element) is, coincidentally, the highest element with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fermium-Ytterbium_Alloy.jpg" target="_blank">photo of it</a>.</p>
<p>Bonus fact 2: The highest element your average human will come across is not uranium (92, which occurs in many rocks/ores), but americium (95). Synthetic americium is used in standard, off the shelf, ionisation smoke detectors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, we have discovered or created all of the elements on earth.
We suspect most of the naturally occurring elements we've discovered exist on other bodies. It is possible to keep adding protons into the nucleus, but to what end is yet to be confirmed. Some have speculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't expect to see many others outside of the ones already discovered because the elements heavier than uranium have extremely short half lives. But there is a hypothesized &quot;island of stability&quot; around element 120 which according to some models would have semi-stable nuclei. So it's possible, although unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
