Do some people get this more than others and does anyone know what goes on in the body for this to happen? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could be several factors, most likely just nerve impulses getting jittered. </p>
<p>Stress can cause it, when someone is under stress their body produces specific hormones that can make them sensitive to pain and muscle tension which could lead to intense, sharp pains. I've also heard that vitamin D or iron deficiencies can cause it too. </p>
<p>I always thought of it like someone has a voodoo doll of me and is clearly fucking with me. I know it's not the case but it's fun to think about.</p>
<p>Edit- For the people <del>whining</del> concerned about my choice of word, when I say &quot;jittered&quot; (an actual word) I mean when the pain receptors are activated and send the signal to the brain via nerve fibers, sometimes that signal gets fucked up. More times than not, that's the source of a sharp pain that doesn't last long, but it can also happen from stress/tension in the muscles or vitamin/mineral deficiencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically any problem in the body can be caused by a problem with one, or a combination of the following: (too much or too little of...)
Mechanical (compression, vibration, movement, etc. Eg. Sitting on your foot and it goes numb),
Thermal (obviously, heat or cold),
Chemical (inside the body or outside, eg. Deprivation of oxygen or nutrients via blood),
Or Electrical (nerve conduction, eg. Overstimulation)</p>
<p>It doesnt necessarily mean you should be concerned, for example hiccups are sometimes caused by an overstimulation of your phrenic nerve, which innervates your diaphragm and causes it to spasm and makes you hiccup! </p>
<p>However, pain shows up when your body has run out of ways to hide or mask the problem. If you have re-occuring sharp pains in the same place or pain is persistent - go get checked out. Persistant pain isn't normal and your body is trying to tell you something.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possibility is arthritis-like inflammation of joints or fascia. Those <em>can</em> come on like a sudden sharp pain.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that tiny muscles can cramp or spasm, but because they are small muscles you don't notice, it doesn't feel like normal muscle pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be a variety of possibilities. Pain is such a general symptom that its hard to pin it to one specific cause without more detail or past information.</p>
<p>In order for pain to be an indicator of a pre-existing condition, the pain has to be localized to an area with a history of occurances.</p>
<p>What it sounds like is periphery nerve stimulation. PNS is often attributed to a &quot;twitch&quot; sensation but at times can be acute pain if a pain receptor is stimulated. PNS can be caused by lots of factors ranging from electric stimulation, imbalances in salts, to strong shifting magnetic fields (in the case of MRIs). It's nothing to worry about. </p>
<p>However, consult a doctor, specifically a neurologist if you are getting these painfull occurances multiple times a day if there is no likely cause (exercise for example) you can attribute the pain to. Usually if there is a neurological issue, there will be other symptoms like motor deficits such as uncontrollable shaking, loss of strength, or seizing.  </p>
<p>Edit: forgot to add that its quite possible that your sitting position/lying down is pinching a nerve and when you shift positions it can cause pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
