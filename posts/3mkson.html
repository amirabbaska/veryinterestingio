		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading this comment threat about the upcoming Martian announcement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3mjrdt/nasa_to_confirm_active_briny_water_flows_on_mars/cvfq50q" target="_blank">This comment</a> got me wondering.</p>
<p>If you were in a decompression chamber and gradually decompressed (to avoid the bends), could you walk out onto the Martian surface with just an oxygen tank, provided that the surface was experiencing those balmy summer temperatures mentioned in the comment?</p>
<p>I read The Martian recently, and I was thinking this possibility could have changed the whole book.</p>
<p>Edit: Posted my question and went off to work for the night. Thank you so much for your incredibly well considered responses, which are far more considered than my original question was! The crux of most responses involved the pressure/temperature problems with water and other essential biochemicals, so I thought I'd dump <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">this handy graphic</a> for context.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> No. Exposure to vacuum or near vacuum is not well understood because it hasn't happened to many people, and while we're fairly sure it will kill you no one really knows what will get you first... but we do have a few ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> You know how liquid water freezes at 0 C and boils at 100 C? That's a lie - it only boils and freezes at those temperature at sea level with atmospheric pressure. If you go up one mile in altitude to Denver then water actually boils at 95 C.  This means that the phase of water is dependent on both temperature and pressure, so if you specify a temperature and a pressure then you can <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg" target="_blank">use this chart to determine the phase of water.</a></p>
<p>The atmospheric pressure of Mars is about 0.6% that of earth, or about 600 Pascals at sea level. So what happens to the water in your body? At this pressure, you're even below the triple point of water, so it can only exist as a gas or solid. Given your body temperature, <em>your eyes would boil.</em> But it wouldn't stop just there. Without the pressure the atmosphere provides I expect any exposed fluids will boil, such as saliva and the fluid in lungs, though whether or not blood boils seems to be an open question. (Also, I don't want anyone coming away from this thinking it means it's impossible for their to be liquid water on Mars - just that the liquid water can't be <em>you</em>)</p>
<p>Jim LeBlanc is the only person I know of who has survived exposure to vacuum (or comparably low pressures)- he was testing a NASA spacesuit in a vacuum chamber when the suit lost pressure. He reported that he could feel the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO8L9tKR4CY" target="_blank">saliva on his tongue boiling, before passing out almost instantly.</a> I'm not a doctor, but I just honestly don't think this would be survivable for any extended period. </p>
<p>In fact, so many things are going to be wrong that the minor inconvenience of experiencing a phase transition might not even be the thing that kills you. </p>
<p>For example, you might be familiar with the concept of the &quot;Death Zone&quot; on Mt Everest. Among other things trying to kill climbers, the atmospheric pressure is about a third of what it is at sea level. The lower partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) results in a lower blood oxygen saturation level, and thus many Everest climbers resort to bottled oxygen. That's a problem at 33% of atmospheric pressure on earth - now consider how deadly it will be at 0.6% on Mars. Even with 100% oxygen (and liquid blood) you'd only have 0.006 ppO2 on Mars, while the survivable limit is between 0.16 and 1.6 (thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3mkson/given_time_to_decompress_slowly_could_a_human/cvfv99o" target="_blank">u/Philip_Pugeau</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because martian air pressure is so low that even 100% oxygen isn't enough.</p>
<p>Normal air you breathe is 21% oxygen.  Normal air pressure is about 100 kPa, so your body expects 21 kPa of oxygen pressure.</p>
<p>Now,  if you go someplace high, air pressure might be half of that.  People can acclimate to 50 kPa air, with 10 kPa oxygen.</p>
<p>To survive at higher altitudes, people use oxygen masks to change the proportion of oxygen in the air.  Breathing normal air at 20 kPa pressure, you'd be getting 4 kPa of oxygen, which is not enough to oxygenate your blood, and you'd pass out.</p>
<p>But if you were breathing pure oxygen, that's 20 kPa of oxygen, which is just perfect.</p>
<p>But this whole technique only works down to 10 kPa ambient pressure.  If the outside air pressure is lower than that, you can't get enough oxygen into your mask to stay conscious.  You need an actual pressure suit to keep the in-suit pressure at least 15 kPa or so.</p>
<p>Now, martian air pressure is less than 1 kPa.  This is <em>way</em> too low.  Even 100% oxygen isn't enough; you'd need at least 1000% oxygen.  The only way to get more than 100% is with a pressurized suit.</p>
<hr />
<p>The oft-repeated claim about blood boiling is dead wrong.  Your blood does not boil even in a vacuum.  That's because even if the outside air pressure is zero, the blood pressure in your veins is high enough to prevent it.</p>
<p>Because the <a href="http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/vapor-pressure" target="_blank">vapor pressure of water</a> at body temperature (37 Â°C) is 6.28 kPa.  In blood pressure units, that's 47.1 mm of mercury.  (The vapor pressure of blood is lower than pure water, so this is a conservative assumption.)   If your blood pressure is 120/70, your blood isn't going to boil.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, at pressures below 6 kPa, which includes Mars, every wet part of your body exposed to ambient pressure <em>will</em> boil dry.  Eyes, mouth, nose <em>and the lining of your lungs</em>.  The latter will do you no good at all <em>but</em> you'll pass out from lack of oxygen before you notice.</p>
<p>(Also, normal intraocular pressure is 10-20 mm Hg, so the fluid inside your eyeballs <em>will</em> boil, but only until it generates an internal pressure of 47.1 mmHg.  This will be uncomfortable and unhealthy, but is not enough to make your eyeballs explode or anything gruesome.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these answers are not answering what was asked.</p>
<p>They are nitpicking.</p>
<p>For example explaining how blood will boil, and how a &quot;normal&quot; oxygen mask is not pressurized.</p>
<p>Therein lies the problem. While their answers are correct given the rationalizations they use, I believe OP was asking if you can isolate the head, could you survive on martian soil.</p>
<p>Now of course to build something that can create a perfect seal around someones neck(Assuming we are isolating the entire head) that is pressurized to Earths atmosphere without leaking would be quite a task, let's not talk about the engineering aspect. Assuming that is true; YES you can survive in space and on mars.</p>
<p>Though for how long is hard to answer. We have studies that show the max amount of full exposure to a vacuum is upwards of 90 seconds. We show no lasting damage if saved quick enough. We know skin is extremely resilient.</p>
<p>So when we know what kills and causes discomfort is the full exposure, tear ducts boiling, ruptures in eyes, air leaving body, mostly the issue is coming down to lack of oxygen and protecting the eyes.</p>
<p>The big debate is always &quot;Does blood boil&quot; and the answer is no, if you could maintain pressure blood won't boil. Full exposure blood traveling within your lungs may experience some issues like nitrogen boiling in blood, but we are assuming the lungs will remain pressurized.</p>
<p>You're body is pretty amazing, you know what the difference between Earth to vacuum is? Roughly the difference of going 10 meters underwater. Skin is more then resilient enough to withstand a vacuum.</p>
<p>So the answer is tricky. Assuming fully isolating the head, you wouldn't experience any lasting effects and could most likely be pretty comfortable on mars for a time.</p>
<p>Eventually you will have issues, sweet will instantly boil, meaning you'll lose a lot of heat due to evaporate cooling, dry skin, feeling a negative pressure along your skin, and yes eventually your skin will begin to slowly dry out, as the top layer of skin any free water would sublimate, cells would die, and it would continue into lower layers of skin sublimating the water.</p>
<p>So to answer the question needs actual studies, but 90 seconds would be a breeze, exactly how long is unknown, but upwards of 5 to 10 minutes with isolated and pressurized helmet shouldn't cause any lasting damage at all.</p>
<p>Though at that point; why not just wear a suit?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even disregarding the atmospheric pressure issue, Mars is literally <a href="http://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html" target="_blank">covered in poison</a>.  The Martian surface is coated in very fine dust (which is a health risk on its own) that is riddled with toxic perchlorates.  Supposedly it would be too risky just to bring a closed suit that was exposed to the Martian surface inside an airlock with you, because of the fine coating of dust it would have received.  I've heard talk of suits on Mars being built so they &quot;dock&quot; into the walls of whatever facility we put there, so the suit itself never has to come inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question has already been very well answered, but I'd like to add that the bends isn't simply caused by rapid decompression. You also need to have a sufficient level of dissolved nitrogen in your bloodstream. It's that nitrogen coming out of solution too quickly and forming bubbles of nitrogen gas in your tissues that causes the bends. These bubbles tend to accumulate in your joints which is rather painful, causing people to hunch over (this is where &quot;the bends&quot; gets its name).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
