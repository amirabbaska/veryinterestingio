		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You cannot breed hardiness into plants without compromising its yield.</p>
<p>Plants have stomata which are tiny little holes in the leaves that allow air exchange to occur. This is necessary for them to breathe and collect carbon dioxide, photosynthesize, then trade it back into oxygen. Exposure to the air causes evaporation and if this process is too fast then the plant will wilt and die.</p>
<p>There are three commonly known respiratory systems.</p>
<p>C3 is the most common system used by plants that has a good balance of air exchange and protection from evaporation.</p>
<p>C4 is evolved for plants that are near water sources. These plants are typically species like grains that don't have to worry about dehydration so the respiratory system goes into overdrive and photosynthesizes as much as possible.</p>
<p>CAM is found in plants that have to survive drought like conditions. Cactus have this system where the stomata remains shut during the day as to prevent as much water loss as possible and is only active at night. This is troublesome because it also needs sunlight to photosynthesize. This is the reason why cacti have the slowest growth rate among all plants.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Weeds grow in harsh conditions because they grow and photosynthesize very slowly to survive. Non-native plants need watering because they produce more rapidly than the local environment can support which leaves them vulnerable to dehydration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the plants that matter, like ones we eat, that kind of hardiness usually works against large yields. We need plants to perform very well and grow quickly to feed all of us. Weeds survive because they don't grow juicy fruit, or large edible roots. They just devote their all to... weedlike growth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are. A list from <a href="http://ucanr.edu/sites/scmg/files/183771.pdf" target="_blank">California University.</a> </p>
<p>The thing is that these are generally more costly seeds. Many have lower yields than normal varieties of the seed. You have to know ahead of time you will have a drought. If you are in adrought prone area it is worth the extra time and money to buy drought tolerant seeds. </p>
<p>I guess the first question is: What type of plants? Crops like those listed have drought resistant varieties, but are you talking about say flowers or other decorative plants? The same thing applies. They may have drought resistant varieties.</p>
<p>The reality is it is possible to breed drought resistance into plants. The reason it doesn't happen is: The market is not ready to pay for them. If you really live in a drought prone area, you buy native or other dry land plants that are naturally drought hardy. Or you make peace with having to water them. The cost of breeding other plants into being drought tolerant is not worth the returns. </p>
<p>Also you are applying survivors bias to the situation. Like in WWII when they wanted to armor the parts of the planes that made it back form bombing runs all shot up. Nope Armor the parts that aren't shot up on the planes that returned. Those are the parts that got the other planes shot down. In this case you are seeing many weeds thriving. On my property for the last three years we had issues with water due to record flooding. So we had a group of weeds that went crazy. Uncontrollable. But it was really only a small number that went crazy. This year is really dry. None of those are even growing. What you get is that for any condition dry, wet, cool, hot, there is some variety of weed that has that as it's perfect conditions. That weed will then go apeshit growing. If it is not ideal for your intended crop/plantings you tend to think &quot;weeds&quot; but in reality it is a group of only a few weeds. There may be weeds that you can't even find growing right now due to the drought that will be back like gangbusters once it is not a drought.</p>
<p>Here is a good explanation of this idea and some of the drought tolerant weeds from <a href="https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/drought/crops/weed-control-strategies-with-dry-conditions" target="_blank">North Dakota extension</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants have a balancing act of growing, reproduction and plant defense. We can and do breed drought tolerant plants but not only are you trying to stack the genes for drought tolerance and disease resistance but also yield. Yield drag is a very common issue when trying to make a more resilient plant as you are trying to break gene linkages and frankly you are relying on a lot of luck to get the combinations that you want. It takes about 7 years to get a new cultivar ready and that's if you are fortunate to get the phenotype you want in the first few rounds of selection, so there are probably many drought resistant crops in the pipeline but aren't ready yet. </p>
<p>It also comes down to the fact that many modern crops were selected to thrive in a conventional agriculture system where they are water and fed pretty regularly. Weeds also are just trying to reproduce, if they don't produce the max number of seeds as usual they aren't a failure. If a tomato plant has much smaller fruit than is expected/normal then it's a failure to the farmer since he put time and money into growing it. </p>
<p>Since breeding is such a long process, there also has to be a demand for drought tolerance. There have been quite a few drought resistance dry bean varieties as part of the market is small growers in Africa who may not have the captial for irrigation, fertilization and mechanization. I live in the US and my state in particular is not worried about drought as we have water everywhere, so why grow a drought tolerant variety when there is a better yielding one out there? Of course if the drought tolerant one isn't much different in yeild than a farmer may switch as watering still costs time and money.</p>
<p>Politics also come into play, the funding agencies always have their own agenda and if they deem drought tolerance not important than they probably won't fund those projects in favor to others. I work in a USDA breeding unit that focuses on traits other than yield but we are expecting getting funding cut as part of the current administration's goals and direction, so work will slow down quite a bit unless we shake other trees for money. The GMO scare and recent controversies also has made people leary of the large breeding companies which are the major distributors of many new varieties and &quot;genetic packages&quot; ie the different resistances that are available. This makes it harder for some countries that could really use those varieties hesistant to adopt them, even if they are non-GMO.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
