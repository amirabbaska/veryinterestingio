		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quick answer is it can sprout, just typically when the fruit begins to over ripen and or rot, the seeds are in a state of dormancy that are activated via different mechanisms, sometimes it's heat from season changes, or water, sometimes the outer layers are hard or and don't allow the seed to sprout inside. It isn't uncommon to see in tomatoes for example, I believe due to the high moisture surrounding the seeds and sometimes apples seeds that are already sprouting in the fruit. as the fruit itself degrades it provides nutrients to the seeds giving them a better chance to grow and survive. Generally however as long as they are in a fruit that isn't rotting or allowing water direct contact to the seeds they aren't likely to exit their dormant phase.</p>
<p>Of course this varies wildly from plant to plant. But it's fun to suspend avocado seeds over water and watch them come alive :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2cybuv/how_does_a_seed_know_when_to_grow/cjkkmir/" target="_blank">Another user has answered a similar question a few years ago, it seems that there can be many factors at play</a></p>
<p>Seeds are remarkably diverse in their ability to germinate, dormancy requirements, and other factors. Seeds can have any or a combination of physical dormancy, embryo dormancy, or even symbiotic dormancy (in a sense). A good general and easy to read source on dormancy and conditions to 'break' the dormancy (i.e., what signals the seed to grow under certain conditions) can be found in this article.</p>
<p>The short version. Some seeds have physical dormancy based on seed coat thickness, type, etc. These seeds typically germinate when they imbibe enough water (oftentimes in the fall or winter when rains come to a particular region). Sometimes they need physical agitation to 'scar' the seed coat and allow water imbibition (various desert grasses, including notably Oryzopsis hymenoides, or Indian Ricegrass). Some have various forms of 'embryo dormancy,' in which embryos only develop slowly, based on the accumulation of growth hormones or the decomposition of chemical inhibitors (peaches, some perennial grasses, etc.). Sometimes these plants can be tricked by scientist (or home gardeners) into germinating by using chemicals such as gibberllic acid (GA) which are naturally occurring growth promoters.</p>
<p>In the case of some orchids (including famous, vanishingly rare American varieties), the seeds are so tiny that they require the action of mutualistic fungi in order to germinate and grow successfully. It is hypothesized that some of the orchid-fungal symbioses are strictly host-specific: one species of orchid requires a species of mychorrhizal fungus that can't interact with any other plant in order to germinate.</p>
<p>In addition to all of those possible routes for seed dormancy, breaking dormancy, and germination, seeds of various plants also have requirements for ripening, after-ripening, etc. This means that some grass seeds (I use grasses because I study them) can mature on the plant, but can't germinate when they fall to the ground during 'seed-shatter.' They need time in dry, warm conditions (makes sense if seeds fall in the summer or late summer in arid environments) before they can be 'triggered' by fall or winter rains. Some grass seeds need a month, some more or less time.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It's really complicated, but a fascinating topic! Plants have evolved a bewildering number of 'seedbank strategies' to ensure long-term viability in their environments, many of which affect the germinability and dormancy conditions of their seeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
