		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning there was energy, then the universe expanded (and cooled) and energy condensed into matter (protons, neutrons, electrons, ...), then universe expanded even more (and cooled) and electrons and protons formed hydrogen. Hydrogen clumped together because of gravity and started to fuse into more complex atoms (helium, carbon, oxygen, iron, and so on, not necessarily in this order). Those large balls of fusing hydrogen are called stars. When stars start running out of hydrogen to fuse they explode as supernova and expel their newly created elements into the void. Those elements lump together because of gravity. Left over hydrogen forms stars again rest of the dust can form planets. Given enough time and favorable conditions this dust starts to react in complex reactions and these reactions can spark life. Life evolves into all shapes and forms until one peculiar shape realizes it is alive and starts to ask questions. It asks: &quot;what I am made of?&quot; and after thousands of years it figures out: &quot;Star dust.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to weigh in here since this subject relates closely with my area of research and there are many misconceptions (or rather partial truths) even among my fellow astrophysicists. </p>
<p>Stars are essentially element factories. They take lighter elements (hydrogen) and create heavier ones (helium, carbon, oxygen, etc....). This mostly happens in two different ways: Fusion and Neutron Capture.</p>
<p>Fusion is when two (or more) atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus. Our Sun is currently fusing hydrogen into helium. This process releases a lot of energy and is the source of all of our Sun's light. Once the hydrogen in the core is used up, it will start fusing the helium left over into carbon and oxygen. When this begins, the star will swell up into a red giant. Depending on the initial mass of the star, subsequent fusions may follow: H &gt; He &gt; C &gt; O &gt; Ne &gt; Si &gt; Fe. The more mass the star has, the further down the chain it can proceed. All the way up to iron. If a star was massive enough to fuse iron, it will then supernova once that fusion is complete. </p>
<p>Neutron Capture is the process by which a nucleus becomes heavier by the addition of neutrons creating an unstable isotope. This new unstable isotope then decays into a new, more stable element. This process can happen very rapidly when there are many neutrons available (r-process) or much slower when there are less neutrons available (s-process). During a supernova event, the abundance of neutrons allows the r-process to create a multitude of elements heavier than iron in its wake. However, this is where the misconceptions arise. This is not the only way to get elements heavier than iron. In old lower mass stars, the s-process is continuously chugging away creating heavier elements as well. About half the heavy elements are thought to be from the s-process. </p>
<p>Now that we have created all these new elements, how do they get out of the star? A supernova is one way. However, supernovae are quite rare since only the most massive stars die in such a way. The majority of stars die in a much less violent manner. Stars like our Sun will never supernova. Instead, they gently blow themselves apart during their late years. In the final red giant phase, these stars grow so big and unstable that material is blown off of the surface into space. This redistributes the new elements back into the galaxy, the result of which we call a planetary nebula (see Helix nebula for example). </p>
<p>The by-products of these dead stars (both supernovae remnants and planetary nebulae) eventually get dispersed through out the galaxy and will one day condense into a new forming solar system. Our solar system is estimated to contain elements created from over 60 different stars which came and died before us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
