		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is a very heavy fuel, it's a large hydrocarbon; you can think of it as a very light oil. When it gets cold enough, it turns to jelly - so diesel fuel systems are insulated and have heaters for winter use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This large hydrocarbon burns really hot - and really slow. The whole point of heat engines like sterling engines, steam engines, and internal combustion engines - which include jet engines, are hot expansive gasses provide pressure to perform work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So since diesel is a lot of chemical energy stored, it produces a lot of cylinder pressure for a long time. To take advantage of the slow burn, diesel engines have a long piston stroke. This means these engines produce torque, force rotating about an axis, for a long time compared to a gasoline engine which both burns faster and has a shorter stroke.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How slow does diesel burn? The fastest diesel engines rotate at 5,000 RPM. Any faster, and you'll be dumping still-burning diesel down the exhaust manifold. That's destructive, wasted energy. By comparison, F1 engines burn gasoline, and the fastest ever built was a prototype for Ferrari by Cosworth with top engine speed of 25,000 RPM. It never made it to competition due to league regulations.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Due to the massive forces a diesel undergoes, and heat, they're built heavy duty and with looser tolerances - to make room for hot, expanding metal components. These things have very favorable durability characteristics. I won't bother getting into the technical nuances, but diesel engines found in trucks, trains, earth moving equipment, generators, ships, etc, have continuous operating lifetimes of years. Gasoline engines aren't built to these tolerances because the vehicles aren't expected to perform such heavy work (they're not as efficient at it) or last that long. In industry, if a truck starts rusting apart, they just replace the body on the frame, and the rest keeps going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many good reasons listed in the other posts here. One more reason is that...gasoline will only ignite in a very narrow fuel-to-air ratio, regardless of the load (heavy acceleration vs idling). </p>
<p>Diesels can operate at VERY lean ratios, and air is free. This means when they are idling or under a steady cruise state, they only need just enough fuel to handle the load they are under. Of course if you add too much air, the hot air that is uncombusted can produce nitrides of oxygen (NOx) in the exhaust, which is considered a pollutant. If you purposely or accidentally run a gasoline engine too lean, it will stop running.</p>
<p>Since internal combustion engines are capable of injecting more fuel than they can possibly burn, the maximum power an engine can produce is directly related to how much air can be moved through it. Hot rodders call it an air-pump that needs a little fuel.</p>
<p>Most gasoline engines do not use a turbocharger, but a turbo is such a good fit for diesels, that almost all commercial diesels use a turbo. Since a turbo is a variable displacement impeller, it moves almost no extra air at cruise RPM's, and it is only after higher RPMs are chosen that it will pressurize and pump a significant amount of extra air. This also means that diesels have a very wide operating range in which it provides usable torque. High-power from a fittable size of motor when it is needed, and then very good fuel mileage when a low load is applied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
