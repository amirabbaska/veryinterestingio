(<a href="http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2018/june/unc-study-tdap-vaccine-given-during-pregnancy-reduces-occurrence-of-infant-pertussis-reinforces-cdc-recommendations-of-immunization-for-all-mothers" target="_blank"><a href="http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2018/june/unc-study-tdap-vaccine-given-during-pregnancy-reduces-occurrence-of-infant-pertussis-reinforces-cdc-recommendations-of-immunization-for-all-mothers" target="_blank">http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2018/june/unc-study-tdap-vaccine-given-during-pregnancy-reduces-occurrence-of-infant-pertussis-reinforces-cdc-recommendations-of-immunization-for-all-mothers</a></a>). However, this appears pretty recent so I don’t know if it has gone through peer review and/or the results have been reproduced. I am aware of the fallacy of relying upon just one study only to find out it was an erroneous result. However, I’m not super proficient in doing scientific research and haven’t found other studies. </p>
<p>My question is twofold: 1) At what stage of the scientific vetting process is this result/Has anyone reproduced it? 2). I know that before efficacy studies are done, there are usually safety studies completed. Can you help me find those so I can take a look at them (I’m having trouble finding studies)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of studies supporting this, which is why the CDC supports maternal Tdap in all pregnancies (and has since 2011 or 2012). It's very robustly upheld.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an epidemiologist, we are trained in medical study design and analysis. The study (<a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)31696-9/abstract" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)31696-9/abstract" target="_blank">https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)31696-9/abstract</a></a>) you're talking about is a very large observational study. The fact that it is published means that it has gone through the peer review process for the American Journal of Prenatal Medicine, meaning that 2-3+ experts (for example: pediatricians, ob/gyn or specialized epidemiologists) in the field reviewed the paper, found the results acceptable, methods sound and okay-ed it for publication.</p>
<p>One Study Fallacy: </p>
<p>With regard to your one study comment: this was done in a very large grouping (675,000+) ) of mother-infant pairs and found that TDAP was protective against pertussis in the child. The fact that it is done with such a large group of people and has such a strong effect ( reduced pertussis by 43% when compared to mothers who didn't get TDAP) is a very reliable result. These values  (CI=0.35, 0.92)  being below 1.00 indicate a statistically significant finding. In the paper, they discuss and evaluate the CDC recommendations (here is a pamphlet <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html</a></a>).</p>
<p>Safety Studies:</p>
<p>This is an observational study, so they didn't have a control/test group-- they had a surveillance system set up to record whether or not the mother got the TDAP vaccine, when, and how it affected the infant. So this didn't need a safety study because you aren't intervening, you are simply observing what is happening in the population.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Here are two other studies that I pulled out of the paper:</p>
<p>A study from six U.S. Emerging Infection Program Network states reported an effectiveness of 78% during the first 2 months of life, whereas another study in the Kaiser Permanente population in California reported an effectiveness of 69% during the first year of life.</p>
<p><a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/5/e20164091" target="_blank"><a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/5/e20164091" target="_blank">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/5/e20164091</a></a></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Maternal Tdap vaccination was highly protective against infant pertussis, especially in the first 2 months of life. Even after infant DTaP dosing, there was evidence of additional protection from maternal Tdap vaccination for the first year of life. This study strongly supports the United States’ current recommendation to administer Tdap during each pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusions.</em></strong> Maternal pertussis vaccination is effective in preventing pertussis infection in infants aged &lt;8 weeks and may be considered in other countries experiencing high levels of pertussis notifications.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) It’s safe to provide pregnant mothers tdap and this vaccine helps protect newborns from pertussis. This has been vetted and reproduced and is not a source of controversy in the medical community.
2) Using google scholar makes it easy to find studies: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=pregnant+tdap&btnG" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=pregnant+tdap&btnG</a>=</p>

<p>Vaccines are cheap, safe, and potentially life saving interventions. The reason for the recent increase in research showing vaccines are safe is in direct response to the pseudoscience “vaccines are bad!!1!!” movement. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
