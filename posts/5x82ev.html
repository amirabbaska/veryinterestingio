		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Game of Thrones is on a paid network with no commercials, it works a bit different.  HBO gets paid via subscribers, shows like Game of Thrones help pull in people who might not otherwise have subscribed.  Add in DVD sales, and you've got pretty much it's whole pool of available money.  </p>
<p>For most TV it works a bit different through.  </p>
<p>Ratings:  Ratings indicate how many people are watching a show.  They're typically measured by the Nielsen group, which hands randomly selected family a special box that monitors what they watch.  If 1 in 10,000 families have a Nielsen box, then each Nielsen box represents 10,000 views.  It's honestly a terrible system, because certain types of are more prone to be selected/be willing to be a Nielsen family.  It also doesn't take into account things like DVR, streaming, etc. </p>
<p>Based on a shows ratings, a sponsor can estimate how many people will see a commercial if they buy air time during the show.  A show like &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; that is routinely the highest rated sitcom on TV, can offer a huge audience, which makes its time more valuable.  A 3rd string show on a smaller network gets less viewer, and thus demands less money.  </p>
<p>Ultimately the networks sell ad time to sponsors, at a rate based on ratings for the show.  The network &quot;buys the show&quot; at a fixed rater per season, by paying the production company that makes the show &quot;$300,000 per episode&quot; or whatever, again based on ratings and thus earnings potential for the show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For cable TV, they make money through advertising. For channels like HBO, ShoTime and Stars, they make money through customer subscription.</p>
<p>As far as ratings go, that's how TV networks know how much to charge for the advertising time. Take the Super Bowl for example. It is notoriously known for having ridiculously high ad prices because they know a shit ton of people are going to be watching. </p>
<p>TV networks don't receive money for having high ratings, per se. There is an independent company (Nielsen) that conducts the ratings and then the Account Executives of the networks use those numbers to sell ads.</p>
<p>I worked in radio advertising for a bit and they operate in much the same way as television.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers explain how TV networks make money airing shows, but shows are also profitable in and of themselves for the studios that produce them. Here's how it usually works:</p>
<p>The Studio develops an idea for Awesome Show and sells it to a network. In this case we'll say the network is ABC.  ABC doesn't actually buy the show outright though, they essentially rent it for a limited amount of time. This is called licensing. If the show costs The Studio $100 per episode to make, ABC might license it for $30 per episode, for the right to air it first and for the next 5 years. </p>
<p>The Studio is now getting $30 back for every $100 it spends. Not enough to make money, so it goes to other networks in other countries and tries to sell the show to them. Maybe a network in Germany buys it for $10 an episode, a UK network buys it for $15, and a French one buys it for $5.  That's another $30 per episode.  Combined with the $30 from the US, The Studio now gets $60 back for every $100 it spends. Still not great. </p>
<p>To cover that deficit The Studio will shoot the show in a location that gives them a tax credit for bringing shooting the production there (many states and other countries have give shows tax credits because the shows create jobs and spend $ wherever they go). So The Studio shoots Awesome Show in Canada where they can get a 30% tax credit (essentially a cash rebate), which is another $30 they can add to the pot. So now they are making $90 back for every $100 they spend.</p>
<p>Now surprisingly, this may be all the studio is able to get at first. So they end up making the show at a loss and covering the difference themselves. This is called &quot;deficit financing&quot; and it's how most shows are made. If the show runs only one season (or just a few episodes) and is canceled, the studio is just out all that money.</p>
<p>But if the show runs a long time (let's say 7 seasons) the economics really start to favor the studio. That's because they will continue to try and sell the show around the world, and the more successful a show is and the longer it runs, the more other people want it. So in season 3 they are suddenly able to sell the show in Belgium, Denmark, Croatia, Italy, Costa Rico and Portugal, for a total of $25.  Now they are making $115 for every $100 they spend. AND, that money comes in for all three of the original seasons, retroactively covering their deficit and putting them in profit for every episode the've made.</p>
<p>And after ABC's 5 year window expires, the money pot grows even bigger because now The Studio can sell Awesome Show in the U.S. to other markets again. When you see a show that originally aired on NBC run in repeats on TNT, that's the studio selling it again and making serious money.</p>
<p>They'll also sell it to other services like Netflix or Amazon, sell it directly to consumers via iTunes, and if it's popular enough, put it out on DVD. All that is more retroactive income. </p>
<p>AND, The Studio can continue to Awesome Show like this FOREVER. After TNT's second window expires in another 5 years, they'll sell the show to another market, then another and another.  And now when they do the sale, it's for the full run of the show. So it's not just $5 an episode for one season, it's $5 an episode for 7 seasons. All pure profit at this point. And as new markets are created (Hulu, Netflix, iTunes) they'll sell it there too. </p>
<p>You know how you see shows like the original Star Trek still appearing on places like Netflix or your local TV network? That's a 50-year-old series STILL generating money for its owner. And once the original cost is covered, that's pure profit for almost no work. This snowball effect can make shows insanely profitable. A successful show that runs for many season and sells well can generate BILLIONS of dollars over time. Seinfeld is estimated to have generated $3.1 billion in profit for example. And it's still selling today.</p>
<p>I know of one show that was almost canceled every season and barely made it to five seasons (two of them shortened) and still made $100 million in profit.</p>
<p>That's why many companies that own TV networks also own their own studios. They can sell a show to their own network (or surprisingly to other networks), and make money both on the licensing side (through ad revenue) and on the selling side. It's a money machine. </p>
<p>(Note: This works differently for pay services like HBO and Netflix, which often pay huge sums to own their shows outright...I'm mostly talking about broadcast TV and basic cable shows).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two answers already given answer the basics of your question.  TV stations make money selling ads during the shows.  Shows on commercial free TV and other subscription based services make money on the subscriptions.  Of course, there is also money to be made later on when a show is sold/licensed to Netflix or syndication.</p>
<p>But on the subject of ratings, it isn't just a question of how many people are watching.  They also monitor the demographics of those people to know how many men vs. women watch, what age group they are in and more.  All of that together gives them the data to use in selling the ad space during those shows.  These days the Nielsen ratings are just part of how they do this.  They can also track what shows are recorded by DVR's, if the shows are watched and within how many days.  And for online views, they can collect a frightening amount of data, down if and how often you pause the show.  How much of this data they take into account to determine the success or failure of a show will depend on the network.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
