		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing to understand here is that fusion is not on/off effect. Its probabilistic effect. And it depends on temperature/density. So the more dense the gas, the more probable it is for it's atoms to fuse and more energy is produced.</p>
<p>This means, that as the proto-star grows more dense, the rate of fusion increases and so does amount of energy produced. Then at one point, the star reaches equilibrium between energy pushing out and gravity pulling in. Also, this equilibrium changes over time, as composition of the star changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars begin hot and bright because they contain a ton of energy from gravitational collapse, with surface temperatures up to around 3000-4000 Kelvin and core temperatures above a million Kelvin. Young proto-stars are actually much more volatile than regular stars because the primary mechanism for heat transfer internally is convection, which leads to lots of irregularities. So much so that such stars undergo regular eruptions (enormous solar flares) as bubbles of heat boil up to the surface. As the star continues collapsing it gets denser and hotter, eventually reaching a state where fusion reactions start generating a significant amount of heat internally. This results in a sufficiently hot interior that the primary mode of heat transport changes from convection to radiation, which causes the heat profile of the star to settle down into a much more orderly gradient ranging from the core to the surface, reducing the frequency and intensity of stellar eruptions. When fusion begins the star as a whole gets hotter, including the surface, but the surface only increases in temperature by a comparatively small amount (10% or so, initially). Stars also get dimmer as they &quot;turn on&quot; because even though they are a little hotter they are <em>much</em> smaller after they've fully collapsed into a star, so their overall luminosity is much less (by orders of magnitude).</p>
<p>In short: stars shine even before they begin fusing due to the energy of gravitational contraction; pre-fusion stars are very bright (because of their large size) and unruly (because convection isn't great for heat transport); as they begin fusion they actually settle down, growing smaller, dimmer, and more well-behaved while only a little bit hotter on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I really like Euphoricus's answer, and want to add that the star will <em>also</em> undergo some heating due to the potential energy lost from the gas falling together due to gravity. I don't know how hot or for how long this process would last, but the point is it will glow some from that alone before the energy from fusion begins to add to the kinetic energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No it takes some time as the fusion begins while the star is still collapsing.  It begins with a cloud collapsing under self gravity. At some point the core will ignite but the protostar is still collapsing up until the point the star blows away the disc to become a main sequence star. I am sure someone else will do a more thorough job explaining this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this, you have to understand how star formation works. In space there are mind bogglingly large clouds of various gasses out there. Because gas stop has mass, it is attracted to itself. Over time this &quot;ball&quot; of gas gets larger and larger.</p>
<p>We know that if you add pressure you something, it gets hotter. At first the amount of pressure expressed on this gas is very small. But as it grows in size, so does the pressure. Eventually, you will reach a mass where the pressure at the center is so great it starts a cascading fusion reaction. A hydrogen star fuses its gas into helium. Follow the elements up the periodic table and that is what it begins fusing next.  Until you reach nickle that is. Nickle is the first element that consumes energy to produce, rather than producing it.  This consequently is one of the causes of a star going supernova.</p>
<p>Once this fusion reaction starts, it takes over pretty quickly, exact times are hard to pin down. But I would expect something along the lines of seconds to minutes. So now you have gravity pulling in on the mass, but a fusion reaction pushing out. At first the size of the star is very variable. But over time, these forces balance out.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
