To do this, the food is cooked in the can, <em>after</em> its sealed.  Foods which fill the entire can, like SPAM or refried beans, distribute the heat well.  Foods which would have air space wouldn't heat evenly without something to distribute the heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off-topic, but you may notice canned beverages are always pressurized too, even if the drink is not carbonated. This is because a pressurized can is much stronger than a non-pressurized one (experiment yourself. Try to crush an unopened can of soda, then open it and try again <em>and spray soda all over your kitchen</em>). They will put nitrogen gas in, for example, cans of hawiian punch, for the structural benefit of the can. They may do this with plastic bottles too, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Edit: this is getting some eyes on it, so I'll link a great engineerguy video on the subject: <a href="https://youtu.be/hUhisi2FBuw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/hUhisi2FBuw</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to reduce bacteria growth during self life and not dry out the food, the container with the food in it is filled with water to remove as much air as possible. Then as Tsunga stated, the food is cooked in the sealed container to sterilize it and help the food to absorb as much water as possible. The water helps to cook the food and keep it moist. Which helps to make the food swell and make it took bulkier.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/02/have-some-oranges-with-that-liquid/index.htm" target="_blank">this Consumer Reports article</a>, as much as 46% of the container is water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Net weight means not the beans or corn or fruit; it means the food plus liquid. Food and liquid are supposed to fill as much of the can as possible, says the Department of Agriculture, so that for green beans, say, “product and packing medium occupy not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container.” </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question: Why are wet beans not available in resealable bags? I'd like to be able to open a bag, microwave what I want and reseal the rest. But they're only available in cans, which apparently are not safe to store in the fridge after opening, so you have to get another container to put them in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the main difference in the example is the contents of the food and how they were processed. Some canned foods are pasteurized (heated at high temperatures for certain periods of time to kill off certain bacteria) while others may be canned in an aseptic environment. In this case food is produced and packaged in an enclosed, pathogen and contaminant free environment.  Now Brining is a form of peservation using salt, another common preservation method is acid which is used in lots of beverages. Canned foods like spam, are a processed food similar to other deli meats. Its basically a bunch of meat glued together with gelatin or another binding agent. deli meats, usually are fairly high in salt or  contain nitrites (another type of preservative that protects against certain nasty bacteria that love to grow on meat). So the main difference is where the preservatives are located so that the manufacture can create a product with the best shelf life for the lowest cost.</p>
<p>TL;DR: They were just processed differently to tackle the same problem of stemming the on coming tide of foodborne illness.
