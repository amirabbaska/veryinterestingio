There was what looked like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram" target="_blank">Voronoi diagram</a> on the top of it.  </p>
<p>I took a picture and put in the coordinates of the pixels where the sites approximately would be into <a href="http://alexbeutel.com/webgl/voronoi.html" target="_blank">this website</a>  and the results matched almost perfectly.</p>
<p>Here are the images of the peanut butter cup, the generated Voronoi diagram and them overlaid:</p>

<p>Why would this be there? Do they use this in the manufacturing process?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is fairly simple.  What is a Voronoi diagram?  It's a diagram created by taking pairs of points that are close together and drawing a line that is equidistant between them and perpendicular to the line connecting them.  That is, all points on the lines in the diagram are equidistant to the nearest two (or more) source points.</p>
<p>Well, whatever those nozzles were, and whatever was coming out of them, chocolate or air, it was coming out at the same speed: where did the two (or more) fronts of chocolate/air/whatever meet and cancel?  At a point roughly equidistant from the source nozzles, where there is a clear transition point on the surface of the chocolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this math question has an engineering-flavored answer: the melted chocolate that they use to cover the peanut butter probably has a somewhat high viscosity.  If all of the chocolate were applied in the center of the cup, it would take a while for all of it to spread evenly over the surface (and it would likely require an external heat source to keep it from cooling too fast and making a mound of chocolate in the middle).  A more efficient technique would be to apply melted chocolate at several points on the surface.  Each Voronoi cell corresponds to a different chocolate-application point.  <del>There would have been temperature gradients based on distance from the application point, and this would result in visible cells and boundaries (i.e. the chocolate will be slightly lighter or darker depending on how quickly it cooled).</del><br />
Edit: coloring is likely due to flow patterns, not temperature gradients (thank you, /u/Sergris) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like u/Not_Quite_Normal's multiple chocolate-applicators theory.  Otherwise, the only thing I can think of is the way that there is often cellular behavior (not like micro-biological cells) in a lot of convective fluid mechanical situations (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93B%C3%A9nard_convection" target="_blank">Rayleigh-Benard flow</a>, for example).</p>
<p>One way this is often visible is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterned_ground" target="_blank">patterned ground</a> formation in permafrost regions.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a chocolate factory...anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. We had these machines called &quot;One Shot&quot; machines that could deposit two different things at once with the use of concentric nozzles. One hopper would be full of chocolate (the outside) and the other would be full of the filling (the inside) which would be peanut butter in this case. The Larger nozzle (chocolate) would first deposit the bottom and a fraction of a second later, the smaller inside nozzle (peanut butter) would fire along with the chocolate, thus being encased. The smaller shuts off before the larger, letting the larger finish off with chocolate on top.
Many times with this technique, the dots you see in the chocolate are the tiny drips from when the larger chocolate nozzle turns off. The chocolate may have been a tiny bit too cool and hardened too soon before it hit the vibrator belt (although if its just a simple thing like peanut butter and didn't involve any nuts or anything, it would most likely just get a gentle rocking rather than a vibration belt job). Then it's pushed into the cooling tunnel for about 40-45 minutes.
My guess is this was a fancy machine with many nozzles for an extra large cup, and the lines are where each nozzle's deposit cooled down and naturally formed the diagram</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
