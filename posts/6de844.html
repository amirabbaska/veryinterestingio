		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haha! Finally MY degree is useful here. I am a special education teacher and teach middle school high functioning autism. I also happen to teach for a cooperative, mrsningy (edit: most of my) studentsâ€‹ come from all around the area, covering multiple school districts each with their own set of expectations for student growth. I'm basically told each year &quot;figure something out&quot;.</p>
<p>Now this would be golden for most teachers who hate teaching from a required script but since I deal with students who hate school by the time they get to me, it can get tough. I'm also a veteran teacher so my admins just figure I know what I'm doing (sometimes I do sometimes I don't). I'm given a budget each year and expected to field an entire curriculum from that.</p>
<p>About 4 year ago I decided that having them read science fiction and fantasy books is over. They prefer that type of story because it's more fun to read, but I hate Harry Potter and the hunger games by now, so I decided to find books that would challenge them. We now read classics iny classroom like &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and 'Huck Finn&quot;, books that have far deeper meaning than anything they would ever read on their own, and books that even most middle school teachers avoid. </p>
<p>So for my experience, we read those books because I want them to. </p>
<p>Edit: We read Percy Jackson each year because I can tie in Greek history and they get a kick out of that. We do read plenty of books they enjoy but I HAVE to expose them to historical literature or &quot;classics&quot; such as The Outsiders which most may not consider a classic yet. Most of my students come to me because their home schools have given up on them and can't figure out how to teach them. I have a specialized classroom designed for their needs and while it is a relaxing place I force them to challenge themselves and at times the work is far tougher than in their home school because I do have that easier environment to learn in. But they all come out better people because of it. If I don't they won't be prepared for high school and I have yet to have a student not finish a book and love it after six years in this group. Yes it's hard and yes they fight at first but once we see in there I see the light in their eyes and I know I have them hooked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Finally, my degree is useful for something!</em></p>
<p>So educators are usually really <em>bad</em> at explaining why you read the things you read for school.  The core concept to grasp here is the <em>literary canon</em>: that is, the body of works that are the foundation of [Western] literature.  They are the most historically and culturally significant pieces of literature being studied currently.  But how do works get added to the canon?</p>
<p>The surface layer is that they get into the canon because old stuffy [usually white, usually male] scholars <em>want</em> to study them, so they do, so it's expected that their students study them, so they do, so it's expected that to prepare for college you have to study them, so you do.  It's not like a few Ivy League professors sat down in a dark, smokey room and discussed the future of the literary canon...but also it kind of is like that?  Keep in mind, there are multiple &quot;sub-canons&quot;.  There is the American literature canon (featuring Anne Bradstreet, Thoreau, Emerson, Faulkner, Hemingway, Whitman, etc.); the British literature canon (Shakespeare, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Donne, Jane Austen, etc.), the poetry canon (Frost, Emerson, Whitman, Donne, Herbert, Shakespeare, etc.), the historical foundational canon (Homer, Virgil, <em>Beowulf</em>, <em>Gilgamesh</em>, etc.), the science fiction canon (Mary Shelley, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, etc.).  I know I'm throwing a lot of names at you; the point is that there is <em>the canon</em> and then there is &quot;I'm studying English poetry in the late 1800s, <em>these</em> are the people I should be reading&quot;.</p>
<p>Which then <strong>raises</strong> the question, why do those scholars want to study those works?  We have the benefit of hindsight, so <em>today</em> we might read Hemingway and [rightly] think he's boring and dry.  But at the time his writing style was revolutionary.  Before Hemingway, prose was all very <em>eloquent</em> and had propensity for verbosity.  Hemingway wrote in a short, clean, <em>different</em> style.  You may not like it, but he made it ok to <em>not</em> write in the old, stuffy way that everyone had been writing before him.  That's not to say Hemingway was the first, or the best, but he was <em>good</em> and he was famous and he showed everyone that you could write in a different fashion.  Suddenly everyone was writing in this new minimalist style, which in turn led to other changes in literature that allowed for the kinds of books we read today for fun.  Without Hemingway, our literature today would look <em>very</em> different.  Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson did the same thing for poetry.  Those are some very specific examples, but I hope they can demonstrate how authors can influence literature, and sometimes they're a part of the canon for those reasons.</p>
<p>The very old part of the canon is in there for much the same reason, but more in the sense of <em>inventing literature at all</em>.  Homer's Odyssey is the foundational work for <em>so much</em> of western literature.  Literally everything you've ever read, <strong>ever</strong>, was influenced by the Odyssey.  And Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest great work of literature - the oldest version of That Movie That Everyone Saw.  It's the first ever example of real literature, which is kind of a big deal.  Studying them can help you understand how storytelling evolved, by showing you how it started.  I won't go into too much detail here about what, exactly, you would learn (narrative structure, framing devices...) because I don't need to give you an English lesson, eh?  Suffice it to say, there's a lot there to unpack.</p>
<p>Some works are a part of the canon because they're just easy to digest.  F. Scott Fitzgerald is fairly easy to analyze and understand on a more abstract level, mostly because all of his symbolism is the same (that is, everything represents the &quot;unobtainable American Dream&quot;).  It wouldn't do any good to say, &quot;Here kids, learn how to analyze literature by <em>analyzing the most difficult literature possible</em>&quot;.  Of course, unfortunately that's often <em>exactly</em> what English classes do.  It's akin to saying, &quot;Here kids, let's learn how to do math.  Shall we start with calculus?  No?  Trigonometry then...&quot;  Which is unfortunate, because literature is awesome and there's some really cool stuff to learn...once you learn the tools you need to do it.  But I digress.</p>
<p>But most of the canon boils down to be cultural icons of the time when they were published, or sometimes later when people rediscovered them.  They can be both a window into the culture surrounding the person that wrote the works, why they wrote what they did, what symbolism they were using at the time, how they thought and viewed the world; and also a window into how that one piece of literature or author or movement changed the culture they were in, which trickled down to influence our own culture.  They can also be ways to understand ourselves by analyzing our own reactions to what we're reading, and the literature in the canon often elicits strong reactions in its readers.</p>
<p>None of that is to say that the canon is perfect; far from it!  I studied English and I hate huge chunks of the canon (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6de844/eli5_how_and_why_are_books_like_the_great_gatsby/di26o3c/" target="_blank">don't even get me started on <em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a>).  But that's the idea of it: important literature that had a powerful influence on people and the times they were from, which encourages others to study that literature, which is itself a strong reaction that encourages others to study why the first people studied it, etc., so that it continues to have influence and continues to be important literature worth studying.  TL;DR: The literary canon is literature that is &quot;worth studying&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: Important thing I totally missed.  The literary canon is also supposed to be an introduction to your own national identity.  When you so much as watch cartoons you'll be getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jDcWAWRRHo" target="_blank">references to cultural icons</a>.  Seriously, as an adult go back and watch Animaniacs (it's on Netflix!) and see how many references you <em>didn't</em> get when you were a kid.  When you read the American literary canon it's in part teaching you what it means to be an American.  It helps build a unifying web of understanding, because when you make a joke about how painting a fence is &quot;fun&quot; and someone else laughs, you think <em>This guy also read Tom Sawyer</em> and you feel a connection with that person.  Enough of those cultural connections help form the glue that is our national identity.  It kind of sounds like indoctrination...and it kind of is.  And that's not <em>bad</em> because it's teaching you about your country and how to be a citizen of that country, which is perfectly fine as long as it doesn't get out of control.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hemingway has one m.  I derped <em>so hard</em>.  Thanks for the guys that caught it.  EDIT: and Emerson, dammnit.  I am a derp, sorry for the typos.  Eventually I'll run out of names to misspell.</p>
<p>EDIT: for the pedants: <del>begs</del> raises</p>
<p>EDIT: Obligatory Thanks for the Gold, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gFLVgp4.png" target="_blank">I think they misspelled Emmerson</a>. ^^/s</p>
<p>Because people have been asking: <a href="https://rhynoreviews.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">This is my scifi reviews/essay blog</a>.  The responses have really been really encouraging, so I'm going to try to revitalize it and get to posting there again.  If you're into aquariums, <a href="https://amateurproaquarist.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">I also have a blog about aquariums</a>.  I do most of my writing on Reddit, though - right here in ELI5!</p>
<p>I have been convinced to reread <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> to see if age will give me a better perspective.  I stand by my dislike of Hemingway, but if you enjoy him don't let me stop you.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - Like the rest of this comment, the books you are assigned to read in class are probably worth reading for reasons that will be made clear if you read the rest of that book/this comment.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: How do we benefit from Shakespeare? The language within his work is a fantasy language based of a dialect of English that's been dead for more than 2 centuries. On top of that nothing in any of the stories I read taught me anything along the lines of morals or even proper story structure. They were just a giant mess of random problems and solutions that seemed extremely pointless.</p>
<p>Not to mention characters lacked any depth whatsoever and their intent was usually apparent within their first scene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They choose the books based of Historical/cultural significance and writing quality. Basically all the books you study should be chosen based on some important theme in them - of Mice and Men is about the depression, Gatsby is about the Roaring Twenties and To Kill a Mockingbird is about racism and the Great Depression. This can inform the students about important context (especially Mockingbird) and a 'real connection' often makes books more attractive to study. </p>
<p>The other reason is that these books are easy to analyse. They are full of symbolism, foreshadowing and the historical context. Books like Frankenstein might be a dry read but it is a goldmine for analysis, and the deeper themes present (social commentary, (possible) homosexuality) means you can go to town on them. It is far easier to study that (and will benefit your skills more) than to go for something more enjoyable and (often) newer - which are often more readable but less deep (or restrictively long). </p>
<p>Of Mice and Men is a really easy text to do analysis in, it's short and full of foreshadowing. Gatsby also has foreshadowing, but also themes of wealth, inequality etc. And some books can be 'read into' easily - that Nick is gay is not specific in the text but many student pick that up and believe it, it gives chances to develop skills simpler books don't have. </p>
<p>These make then qualify for the studying 'cannon', books like Gatsby and Of Mice and Men are chosen a lot because of the wealth of secondary literature on them, making critical opinion easy to find. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two reasons we read these books: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The books are part of a group of well-respected books called &quot;the canon.&quot; These are books that over the years scholars have studied again and again until they became &quot;classic.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Out of all the books in the canon, some are easier to teach because  they are more obvious in their use of literary devices (tools writers use to make their points). The Great Gatsby, for example, uses metaphors and symbolism all over the place. They're easy to point out and kids get a quick win when they recognize them. </li>
</ol>
<p>Most high school reading fulfills both of these criteria. Occasionally you'll see teachers pick books that aren't classic but have a literary device they want to teach, or you'll see books from the canon that are harder to teach but important to learn (some Shakespeare). But you'll seldom see some of the denser  or more ambiguous books in the canon: I've yet to see a high school teacher try to teach Ulysses. </p>
<p>Edit: TIL that plenty of high schools were way cooler than my kinda crappy backwater public school and taught Joyce's Ulysses. Color me jealous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
