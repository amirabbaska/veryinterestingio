		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Netflix offers a very similar value proposition to HBO.  Subscribers pay a monthly fee and get a selection of movies and original programming and neither show ads.  The monthly price of premium cable channels is very similar to the price of Netflix.  </p>
<p>Cable is a bundle of channels, offering in total far more content than Netflix (though it's a very broad bundle so only a small portion of the channels appeal to most subscribers).  While the bundle price is higher, but each channel gets far less than Netflix gets (most channels get less than a dollar per month from each subscriber's cable bill) which means they supplement the monthly fee with ads.  </p>
<p>The other major difference is a cable bill also bundles together the content and delivery of said content.  To fairly compare the price of cable with Netflix, you'd have to include some or all of your ISP bill too.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly because of sports. The cable company has to purchase the programming and the contracts are renegotiated every few years. The networks charge more and more for their content and in reality it's mostly because of sports. </p>
<p>Netflix doesn't have NFL, NBA, NHL etc but would be way more expensive if they did. </p>
<p>Also, Netflix does not have an infrastructure to maintain therefore it can operate on a smaller profit margin because it has an unlimited footprint. It's operating on the backs of the cable companies who are maintaining the infrastructure that Netflix uses, which is the #1 reason why the cable companies want to repeal neutrality so they can charge Netflix extra money for using ~65% of all bandwidth in prime time hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Last Mile</strong> is a communication term for the end part of a communication network - connecting to the end user. For eg. in a telephone system, this would be the box from the utility line, the cable to your house and the telephone/modem at your house. </p>
<p>Traditional cable companies, like all communication providers would have to have to install the infrastructure, maintain it and bear all the costs for it. This is usually the most unpredictable and costly part of the infrastructure. That's why cell phone network growth in developing countries has been very fast to catch up with the developed world. </p>
<p>However, even cellular companies would still have to install and maintain cell phone towers. While Netflix by opting to deliver DVDs through postal mail first and then later changing to just online streaming - bypasses this most troublesome and expensive part of content delivery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what the others have said I would add that Netflix, specially in its original productions, uses pretty relevant amounts of paid product placement (<em>e.g.</em> from the top of my head, notice how many times Uber is mentioned in many of their shows). So, I don't think it can truly be said that Netflix doesn't run any ads ever...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All money collected by Netflix goes to Netflix and is used to license or produce programming.</p>
<p>A cable provider much then pay 100's of channels for access to their programming. So Comcast, AT&amp;T, etc. each pay ESPN $7/mo for every subscriber. And $1/mo for TBS, and so on. ADDITIONALLY, the cable companies have to pay to lay and maintain all the literal CABLE wiring used to distribute their programming, including the internet infrastructure that Netflix uses to distribute their programming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
