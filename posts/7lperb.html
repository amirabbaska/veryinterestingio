		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of folks noticed that the plume looked a lot like a contrail at first, then ballooned outwards later.</p>
<p>As the rocket reached higher and higher altitude, there's less ambient air pressure to push against the rocket exhaust coming out of the engine, so the plume is able to expand much farther - this is what gives the plume its characteristic balloon shape.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since a lot of folks are asking what the &quot;bright dot&quot; was on the inside of the balloon structure:</p>
<p>That was the separation of the reusable primary stage. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE5C3O71Xqo&amp;t=2m18s" target="_blank">In this high-res video</a> you can actually see the primary stage end (when the thrust goes dark), the secondary stage ignite (when the thrust goes bright again), and then the bright dot of the separated first stage lagging behind and dropping a bit. Note that it doesn't just drop like a rock, since it's also on a ballistic trajectory - it takes some time to lag behind and start falling. If you look closely, you can also see some spiral waves coming out from it, presumably because it's tumbling around while thrusting a bit to control its eventual descent.</p>
<p>Eventually that first stage will land and be used again. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/69PZxU9.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a schematic</a> of how all of the above actually works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You saw liftoff, stage one separation, stage two light off and leave great plume, sunlight reflection and then the fairing separation which many camera persons captured greatly trailing the stage two separation. Great view of Sunlight plume. Probably the best view people has ever seen of a rocket launch. You only see this when you launch at a late hour just after sunset or in the morning just before dawn. Try imagining where the sun is in the video and then you get why its only lighting up high flying objects or exhaust plumes in this scenario. When the earth rotates another hour, the sunlight would be blocked completely be earth and we would see only the fire from exhaust not the smoke light up like in the video. When rockets launch at daytime, the smoke plume gets illuminated just as in this video. But against an already bright sky it does not look super bright or glowing.﻿</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rockets leave a plume of smoke / water vapor.  As the rocket gets higher, the air is less dense so the plume gets wider &amp; wider.  The plume is lit by sunlight and blends into the background during regular daylight launch.  Around sunset/sunrise, the rocket rises high enough to be in direct sunlight and the plume is quite brilliant against the dark background.  </p>
<p>In the videos going around, the plume changes and then has wisps inside of it due to the first and second stage separating, and possibly to the fairings getting jettisoned.  The second stage plume is hitting the first stage and/or fairings.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
