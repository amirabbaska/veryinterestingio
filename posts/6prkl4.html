Interested to see if there is a physics related reason for this.</p>
<p>Edit 1: syntax.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Ooo first time hitting the front page! Thanks Reddit.</p>
<p>Edit 3: for those wondering - my microwave which I've checked is 1100W is placed on the other side of the house to my modem with a good 10 metres and two rooms between them. </p>
<p>Edit 4: I probably should have added that I really only notice the problem when I stand within the immediate vicinity (within approx 8 metres from my quick tests) of the microwave, which aligns with several of the answers made by many of the replies here stating a slight, albeit standard radiation 'leak'.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves from microwave ovens do interfere with WiFi signals because physically they are the same thing. They are both electromagnetic waves with frequencies around 2.4GHz. Your microwave door should in principle block inside radiation from the magnetron from escaping but there can be some leaks. And since the amplitude of the these waves is much higher than the ones emitted by your router antennae, if you are near your functioning microwave oven, you may experience packet drop or total loss of WiFi connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a number of factors at work here. Microwave ovens are powered by a vacuum tube called a magnetron. It uses a magnetic field to cause electrons to excite cavities that resonate at a frequency near 2.4 ghz. They could be made to resonate at other frequencies, but that specific one is called an ISM band and is not supposed to be used for communication, but rather a trash space to place things that do what a microwave does, such as heating food using microwave energy. Over time it became a kind of free-for-all and data (and video, audio, remote controls, and so forth) transmitters appeared on the band as well because you did not require a license to transmit there.</p>
<p>So the magnetron is a radio frequency generator, inside a box. If you do the math, the box doesn't ever have 100% isolation, even at -60 dB of isolation, 1 milliwatt still escapes the device and is radiated. This assumes a good seal, properly designed cavity, no damage to the unit or manufacturing defects. In fact, there was a phenomenon called &quot;Perytons&quot; and it was thought they came from outer space. Turns out that sensitive radio-telescopes could hear the burst of microwave energy as the door was opened on a microwave oven before the magnetron had stopped. For real! </p>
<p>Wifi devices are limited in power output and sometimes cannot overcome the signal generated by the oven, and thus the access point cannot hear you. However, Wifi is built on ethernet and the OSI networking stack. Rather than fail instantly, the &quot;connection&quot; between you and the access point is fictional. Your devices will just try sending over and over again until the AP acknowledges receipt of the transmission. The AP doesn't really know if your phone is there or not, it can only wait for the acknowledging reply to its transmissions, and vice versa. There can be 99% packet loss but the few packets that get through are enough to convince the phone that the wireless network is still out there listening for it.</p>
<p>As another poster commented, the magnetron isn't tightly controlled in frequency as a proper radio transmitter would be. It can drift in frequency to the limits of how the cavities in the devices will resonate. So, statistically it will output more power at 2.4 ghz than say at 2.3 or 2.5 ghz, but you never know where the peak of the output shall be. Early ovens took the 110v AC wave from the mains power and applied only a half-wave rectification, leading to the magnetron pulsing on and off at a 60hz rate. This was enough of a gap that clever wifi devices could expect the gap as the negative AC cycle approached, and attempt to slot their packet in that small window. This technique is only effective if there are gaps. Modern ovens run off an inverter which generates a constant DC high voltage to power the magnetron and thus there are no gaps to fit packets in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've watched my microwave running using a spectrum analyzer, and it was neat because the frequency and bandwidth of the output was highly variable. It wandered all over the place ROUGHLY within 2400-2483 MHz. My oven is equipped with a turntable, and I noticed that the frequency pattern repeated with each rotation of the food. Apparently, the magnetron's frequency output is dependent on the specific instantaneous absorption of the energy by the food being heated.
The frequency range of 2400-2483 MHz is called ISM which means Industrial, Scientific, and Medical-so basically any unlicenced device such as WiFi, ovens, phones, baby monitors, etc may use the frequencies.  There is no guarantee that the devices usinng ISM won't harm each other's operation. For assured interference-free operation of wireless devices... LICENCED frequencies are the only path. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally, my time to shine. I work on RF design for WiFi and can answer your questions.</p>
<p>Older WiFi routers operate in the 2.4GHz band, the same band as your microwave oven. Newer WiFi uses 5.0GHz band is much better for a variety of reasons, so highly recommend you upgrade to 5.0GHz when you can afford to.</p>
<p>Each WiFi channel uses a different frequency range (channel) of the  2.4 band. WiFi channel 1 operates between 2.402GHz and 2.422GHz, channel 6 between 2.427GHz and 2.447GHz, and channel 11 between 2.452GHz and 2.472GHz. They actually reach a bit past these limits, but not enough to matter. Notice these channels have only 0.005GHz separation. That's why you should only ever use channels 1, 6, 11 unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>WiFi signals are transmitted in milliwatts. The amount you're allowed to transmit depends on country, channel, and whether you're inside or outside. Typical inside routers transmit around 22dBm which is 0.150 watts. That's <em>very</em> low power. By the time the signal reaches your laptop about 10 feet away, the power drops to -50dBm or 0.00000001 watts. And if you're 30 feet away you might get as low as -70dBm or 0.0000000001 watts.</p>
<p>Your microwave oven creates ~ 1000 watts of energy in the 2.4GHz band. It's also a broad band that covers most of the 2.4GHz spectrum, easily affecting all WiFi channels simultaneously. To keep the energy inside the oven there is shielding but the shielding does <em>not</em> stop all the energy. It only attenuates (reduces) the energy. Typical oven doors have a wire mesh that attenuates 1  part in 1 billion, or 0.000000001 times the energy. But if you figure that out about 0.0000001 watts are escaping. This is very low power  and not enough to hurt you, but it's still 1000s times stronger than your WiFi signal. </p>
<p>To your WiFi laptop, it's like something suddenly shouting over the conversation. WiFi talks at a whisper and the microwave oven, even with shielding, is like a fog horn. This is called &quot;noise&quot; and it prevents the WiFi conversation from being understood.</p>
<p>You can fix this by upgrading your router to 5.0GHz which is better for so many reasons I can barely begin to describe, but the most obvious being that your microwave oven will no longer break your WiFi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave ovens heat food by generating strong radio waves in the 2.4GHz band.  This is the same band traditionally used for Wifi signals (newer Wifi can optionally use 5GHz instead) and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Why the same band?  Because there are government-enforced regulations about what radio frequencies are allowed to be used for what purposes, and 2.4GHz has always been a band that is allowed to be used without any license, by ordinary consumer equipment.  It doesn't travel particularly far and won't significantly interfere with people more than say 100m (300 feet) away.  And you're not going to disrupt the important frequencies that any scientific or government agencies use, any aviation or hospital equipment, and so on.</p>
<p>But wait you say - my microwave is generating the same type of radio waves as my wifi router?  Why doesn't my wifi router give me cancer?</p>
<p>Firstly, the microwaves generated by microwave ovens and wifi routers won't give you cancer.  They are classed as non-ionizing radiation, along with the frequencies used by TV, radio and mobile phones.  The type of radiation that can give you cancer are in the UV range, including X-rays, gamma rays and ultraviolet light.  Microwaves are simply a subset of radio waves that are relatively high in frequency, but lower than visible light and the cancer-causing frequencies beyond that.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reason your food heats up in a microwave oven is that the microwaves are of a high energy level (much higher than cellphones or wifi), and concentrated and reflected in a small space, contained by a metal cage.
These radio waves excite the molecules in the water in your food and warm them up.  If your microwave door came off while it was on, the radio waves would just escape into the atmosphere, and since it was no longer contained and reflected inwards into a small space, the energy would not be concentrated enough to warm you up very much.  It just wouldn't work.  It would however significantly interfere with your wifi and bluetooth (and that of all your neighbours).</p>
<p>The metal cage around the microwave should prevent radio waves from escaping, but since the levels inside the microwave are so high and the faraday cage effect of microwave ovens isn't perfect, a small amount is likely to escape which is what can interfere with your wifi or bluetooth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
