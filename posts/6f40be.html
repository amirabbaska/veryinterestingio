		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes up a lot because it is a function whose derivative is proportional to its current value. Many differential equations that describe natural phenomena show this kind of dependence, making (e) inevitably show up in the solutions describing these natural phenomena. </p>
<p>Another way to think of it is in terms of the Euler equation and Eigenfunctions. Many system models describe systems as Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. In these systems, the exponential functions with a complex argument is an Eigenfunction, i.e. a complex e stimulus yields a complex e response with some scaling factor. This makes them the simplest, concise and complete way to describe the response of such systems.</p>
<p>I know this is too much technical jargon. I can try to simplify it further if you want.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from a particular function : the exponential function.</p>
<p>Ok, so the exponential function is pretty unique. It is the only function other than the &quot;always-zero&quot; function that is always equal to its own gradient. That means that a lot of random things follow its shape, things where the speed of the process depends on the size of the process (chemical reactions, atomic ones, bacteria populations who double every fixed amount of time, etc etc.) Basically, it's the function that fits phenomenon that have a feedback loop built into them : the bigger it is, the faster it goes, and the faster it goes, the bigger it becomes.</p>
<p>Now, e, the number, is just the value of this exponential function for an entry value of 1. It pops up a <em>lot</em> because it makes writing the exponential function very, very easy : exponential of x (exp(x)) can be written e^x</p>
<p>Plus, the &quot;always equal to its gradient&quot; bit means that the exponential function is the cornerstone of every technique we have to solve differential equations, so it pops up in a lot of abstract math too. </p>
<p>And it can also simplify a lot of work on complex numbers, which are a powerful tool to work on a whole other class of problems </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1>A Simple Answer - Why e (the number) appears so often.</h1>
<ol>
<li>Nature tends to be self-referential in many ways. One way is rates-of-change.   </li>
<li>The number e is mathematically interesting because it represents <em>the</em> (the one and only) self-referential power function. IOW, the derivative of e^x is e^x.</li>
<li>Therefore, many natural (self-referential) rate-of-change equations can be (must be) described in terms of e^x.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!  But it's also useful to understand a little more about the definition of derivatives and the number e itself, which I discuss next.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What is a derivative?</h1>
<p>All of the following are (nearly) the exact same thing:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The rate of change of a function.  </li>
<li>The derivative of a function.  </li>
<li>The slope of a function.  </li>
<li>A tangent line to a function.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For visual learners, here's an animation. The <em>value</em> of the moving line (shown at the bottom) is the slope aka the derivative:</p>

<hr />
<h1>Whenever we talk about e we keep referring to e^x.  Why?</h1>
<p>Because that's where e comes from.  It is specifically the function y = A^x , considering A is a constant, such that the value of the function (the y value) is everywhere exactly equal to it's slope (equal to it's derivative).  The solution is A = 2.71828183... = e.   It looks like this:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>e</em> comes up so often because the exponential function <em>e^x</em> comes up so often.</p>
<p>And the exponential function comes up often because it describes situations where the rate of change in the amount of something is related to how much of the something you have at any point in time. </p>
<p>This relationship is important for radioactive decay, bacteria growth, finance, wave theory in electromagnetics, speed of chemical reactions, and tons of other phenomena.</p>
<p>Bacterial growth is probably the easiest example here.  If you have a bunch of bacteria sitting in a nutrient rich environment, then 30 minutes from now, you're going to have more bacteria.  And the amount of new bacteria is going to be related closely to how many you started with.  That right there is a relationship described by an exponential function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Very simplified answer if someone needs</em></p>
<p>Let's say you put money in a bank and you get a certain revenue, say 5% yearly.</p>
<p>One way to approach this is simply to add 5% to your account at the end of the year.</p>
<p>But what if you want to add 2.5% in the middle of the year and 2.5% at the end. Since you will be adding 2.5% to already increased price, you will get more.</p>
<p>Now divide the year into 3, 4, 6, 10, 1000000.. parts in a similar way, always getting a little more because you increase your funds a bit along the way. When you eventually 'chop' the year into infinite parts, the cashflow can be described by the exponential function. </p>
<p>Now you can apply this to, say, a colony of bacteria. To simplify we can assume that the rate of growth of bacteria is only proportional to the number of bacteria.  Since the growth is proportional to their numbers in every given moment, similarly to the bank model, you can again use the exponential function to describe number of bacteria in certain period of time. Most things in nature have similar dependency and therefore are described by the exponential function. </p>
<p>Many people said d/dx (e^x) = e^x is the reason, I think it's more likely another consequence of the meaning of exponential function, although the mathematically correct derivation has this property as one of premises for the function.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
