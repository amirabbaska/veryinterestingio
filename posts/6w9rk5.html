		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For upland game birds (e.g. Pheasants, dove, quail) wearing orange prevents you from getting shot since to hunt them you commonly see people hunting in groups and the birds they have to be flushed from usually tall grass and bushes, so camo is not really a necessity. However, since a lot of camo gear can have water resistance and are good in cold weather you will commonly still see hunters wearing it since its practical for morning cold weather....and probably where you will likely see hunters wearing camo that absolutely doesn't match the environment because it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>For waterfowl (geese and ducks), you are going to be stationary so the risk of getting shot is minimal, and iirc if you aren't in full camo without orange the birds will not fly in. Orange not really a necessity, but typically a camo pattern resembling reeds is.</p>
<p>Turkeys can see color. They are one of the smartest things you can hunt, but then if you're everyone's favorite dinner you evolve to be smart af. Wearing camo and likely sitting in a pop up blind is likely going to be the only chance you have at drawing them in close enough. You cannot wear orange because the bird will know what's up. Makes a risky hunt if other hunters don't know where you are.</p>
<p>For larger game like deer, yes most can't see color but they really can differentiate between the black and white and gray shading they see on the world, so camo that matches the geography around you is needed- woodland pattern in woodlands, sage for high desert, etc. typically one can also have orange intermingling in the design of some of the camo, but you'd also hope if someone is targeting a deer they've got a scope and are looking at their target, knowing not to shoot you if you are not wearing orange.</p>
<p>TL;DR- geography and the animal being hunted determine necessity of orange, or a particular pattern of camouflage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Wisconsin, blaze orange (and now pink) is worn during deer season as well as upland bird hunting(pheasant and grouse). This is done for visibility. That said, it often helps to have patterns in the blaze orange (camo patterns or black stripes) to break up a silhouette. Some states require a minimum Sq ft of unbroken blaze.  Waterfowl and turkey hunting typically does not require blaze. Most birds have incredibly good eyesight and can see some colors so it is essential to blend into your surroundings to the point where your camo patterns should match your natural patterns (spring and fall forests, snow, reed canary grass).</p>
<p>TLDR: the camo patterns with blaze orange helps break up a silhouette so while the game may not see orange, they don't see a solid grey blob.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two kinds of hunting: big game and quarry.</p>
<p>Big game are often things like deer and elk. Quarry are smaller things such as rodents and birds. Both kinds have very different quality of vision.</p>
<p>Big game tends to have terrible vision - so bad in fact that entire parts of the spectrum are missing. They rely instead on sound and smell.</p>
<p>Quarry on the other hand has VERY good eyesight and will see you coming unless you try to blend in visually with your surroundings. For this reason you want to wear things like <a href="https://www.realtree.com/sites/default/files/styles/scaled_and_cropped_site_preview/public/content/camo/swatchxtra.jpg?itok=AVTGtJzb" target="_blank">RealTree</a>, as quarry has a hard time determining your size, position, shape and even existence when you're fully dressed in this.</p>
<p>When you're hunting one of the most dangerous risks is being shot by another hunter. For this reason hunters wear blaze orange, a colour that deer and elk are blind to. Nobody wants to be completely dressed in orange though, so for the rest of a hunter's outfit they'll try to blend in. That means it's OK to wear camo and orange, but bright blue would be a problem. For this reason you see hunters in camo putting on blaze orange vests.</p>
<p>Being shot by other hunters is such a big problem that here in NZ we have rules such as &quot;completely identify your target - do not rely on sight, sound or movement alone.&quot; There have been many cases of hunters carrying deer they have killed out on their backs only to be shot because someone thought it was still alive. A common thing to do is to wrap the antlers or dress the deer in an orange vest.</p>
<p>Hunters feel slightly better about blending in with the surroundings when it comes to quarry because the calibres are smaller or they use birdshot. It's much easier for another hunter to tell a disguised human from a bird as well. </p>
<p>In fact, when you're hunting quarry the most dangerous aspect is still other hunters, but the risk is generally from other hunters not checking their field of fire. What may be beyond their target, or the risk of ricochets from hard surfaces and water, etc. When hunting ducks for example there will be many hunters positioned around a lake - for this reason it's illegal to shoot at birds on the water as you may ricochet or shoot another hunter across the lake directly. When discharging a shotgun at quarry you must be pointing at a bird in flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The point is to break up the human shape with different shadows (or what looks like shadows) and such in various shapes like what is natural in the background environment you are hunting in. Most animals that we hunt are color blind and cannot see the color orange so that is not an issue, but the human shape is an issue. So you want to look like the forest background, or grassland background, etc to blend in and break up your human shape. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
