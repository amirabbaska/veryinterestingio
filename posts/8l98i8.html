Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are I are plumbers.  </p>
<p>We each bill 300K worth of plumbing work each year.  We each spend 50K on materials each year.  We each have 100K of business expenses each year.</p>
<p>You are incorporated, I am not.  How much tax should each of us pay?  The same.</p>
<p>Since I am not incorporated I take the 150K I made in profit and pay tax on it like income at my personal rate.  Lets say I end up paying 50K in tax.</p>
<p>Since you are incorporated you pay corporate tax on the 150K, and then distribute the remainder to yourself as a shareholder.  That's dividend income and as a person you are going to pay tax on it.  </p>
<p>The government plays with the personal dividend rate, and the corporate tax rate with the (rough) idea that it should add up to the same as the personal tax rate for regular income.</p>
<p>That's why, primarily, corporate tax rates are different from personal tax rates - the government knows the money is going to be taxed again when passed on to shareholders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because law differentiates between natural persons and persons-as-legal-entities. Corporate &quot;personhood&quot; is important in some ways...like if I need to sue a business, the fact that it's a person just means it's an entity I can sue as a whole. </p>
<p>The biggest problems people have with it surround the fact that a corporate person has better abilities to do some things than natural persons, like immortality. A business can be passed from one generation to the next. </p>
<p>Corporate tax benefits are intended to help boost an economy, but the extent to which they are successful is hard to measure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised so many people took this as &quot;what is the legal explanation behind corporate personhood&quot; instead of your actual question. The answer is that this income is double taxed - it's taxed to the corporation at a lower rate, and then is ALSO taxed to the individual when the corporate income eventually reaches them in the form of dividends (remember that corporations are owned by individuals - shareholders). </p>
<p>Here's an explanation: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double\_taxation.asp" target="_blank">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double\_taxation.asp</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personhood doesn't mean that a corporation has exactly the same legal rights as a person...you can't marry a corporation or elect one to office, for example.</p>
<p>It is just a convenient fiction we use to allow corporations to do some person-like things, like own assets or legal responsibilities.  In most, if not all cases, different rules apply to corporate personhood than to natural persons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, a lower corporate tax rate makes foreign direct investment more attractive. For example, the irish corporate tax rate is relatively low compared to the rest of the world, so Apple decides to declare its income there, and Ireland enjoys the revenue generated by that tax.</p>
<p>If ireland had a higher income tax rate, then companies would 'shop' for lower taxes elsewhere, and the point of raising the tax rate (to increase tax revenue) would have been lost.</p>
<p>Compare this to regular people, sure they can go emigrate due to high taxes (for example, French Actor Gerard Depardieu did this when France raised its income tax a while ago), but its harder for a person to do so, and most people just won't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
