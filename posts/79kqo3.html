		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A short extract from New Scientist, 17 June 2015.</p>
<p>Our feelings of fullness are governed by a complex mix of factors, including the physical feeling of our stomach stretching, and the chemical and hormonal signals the food triggers arriving in our brains.</p>
<p>Foods high in protein and fibre are particularly good at this (see “Weighty questions“). Some food manufacturers have already started marketing diet foods that are supposed to keep people fuller for longer, based on these principles.</p>
<p>But there may be ways to push our satiety buttons harder still, thanks to the growing realisation that certain types of carbohydrate are particularly good at sending fullness signals from the gut to the brain.</p>
<p>Some are special types of fibre that become viscous when eaten and fill up the stomach. Another group of such compounds are a type of starch, naturally present in certain plants, which cannot be broken down by the enzymes in our small intestine, where most of our food is absorbed. Only when this “resistant starch” reaches our lower bowel is it finally digested by the resident bacteria, which release chemicals called short-chain fatty acids.</p>
<p>These chemicals send messages to the brain that starch is reaching the lower gut without being digested. “That tells the brain to slow up on the input,” says Stephen Bloom of Imperial College London, who helped discover some of these mechanisms.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No -- a counterexample to that is that fiber is filling because it takes time for the body to digest. However, fiber doesn't have many calories at all. The FDA has estimated a mere 1.5 calories per gram of fiber due to bacterial degradation.</p>
<p>High fat foods are satiating and pretty much the reason why Keto / LCHF diets can work for some. Fatty foods are definitely calorie rich and you'd normally say that only makes you fat, but key here is that they keep you satiated far longer than &quot;quick carbs&quot; like rice or white bread. So you can't put two calorie counts against each other like that; satiation and for how long plays a major factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hunger is triggered by 2 mechanisms. Mechanoreceptors in the lining of the stomach detect stretching of the stomach from being physically filled. The other is chemoreceptors in the body that detect chemical levels of nutrients you need. Basically if you are eating something that is digested very quickly like sugars you’re body will feel the stomach emptying and make you want to eat again to fill it up. Eating fiber or tough protein will stay in your stomach longer. Or if you are eating food without any nutritional value your body will start craving foods that have what you are low on. Junk food like chips or candy are just sugar, so while they can suppress your hunger at the time, if your body is low on say protein for example you’ll very quickly be hungry again because your body isn’t getting what it needs. That’s why pregnant women have weird cravings. They also react to what the baby wants.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How has this not been answered appropriately yet? It’s incredibly important people understand this. </p>
<p>The scientific term is satiated, which we understand as the feeling of being full. While the feeling is obviously subjective, we have shown that three things lead to satiety in most people: water, fiber and protein. </p>
<p>Because your body must follow the laws of thermodynamics, you will ultimately lose and gain muscle and fat mass due to calorie intake vs. calorie output, but the different types of calories consumed will lead to different levels of satiety. </p>
<p>This is why it’s important to eat a healthy and balanced diet, especially if you are trying to lose weight by eating at a caloric deficit. Drinking a proper amount of water, and eating whole foods with high protein and fiber will make you feel more satiated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The science of satiety is super interesting. That's the word we use for the feeling of fullness. There's a few things at work here, all of which are quite interesting. </p>
<p>First, your GI tract and brain are quite connected. The concept of a gut-brain comes up occasionally. It's important to note we have hormones produced in the GI system which ultimately affect behaviour, including food seeking behaviour. </p>
<p>So when your stomach is empty, a hormone called Ghrelin is secreted. It heads to a part of your brain called the hypothalamus and increases hunger while preparing the body for food with more stomach acid etc. This hormone is secreted less when the stomach is stretched - it can tell because cells there have stretch receptors or mechanoreceptors. Ghrelin gets a bit complicated because it also has production in brain and might have other actions all over the place from placenta to lung tissue. There's a couple other hunger hormones as well (such as one that uses a receptor THC binds to, for example). </p>
<p>So what do we know from the above physiology? </p>
<p>Stretching the stomach stops some hunger hormone. Bulky foods and foods that digest slower fit this bill! On a chemical level, this means proteins and fats are better than carbs, because carbs start digestion the moment they hit saliva. Importantly it also means &quot;complex carbs&quot;, which are not simple sugars, are better. It also speaks to the value of fiber and food bulk (solid foods over smoothies!) in reducing hunger. </p>
<p>The caloric value of food is oddly irrelevant to how full it makes you feel. </p>
<p>Well what of actual energy? Well, we do have a sort of &quot;low battery&quot; indicator in the form of another hormone called Leptin. It's produced by fat cells - more fat, more Leptin - and causes satiety (not-hungry). If you were starving, Leptin levels drop and that hunger becomes unopposed. As a point of interest, in obesity we seem to see higher Leptin levels but also an insensitivity to Leptin where they aren't responding to it (similar to type two diabetics and insulin). Like Ghrelin it gets a bit complicated and does have all sorts of effects all over the body. </p>
<p>Anyways, caloric value of food won't make you more full but your body does pay attention to its reserves. </p>
<p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly, I've noted that the brain produces some of these hormones and really drives all behaviour. There are many psychological factors at play with food. We have dopamine reward systems that absolutely love simple sugar, despite its lack of value in a developed country diet. We have cultural and personal factors influencing our food drive. We have stress hormone cycles changing out appetite. We have the very concept of meals affecting our hunger at various times. We have the sight or smell of food increasing hunger. There's lots at play. </p>
<p>But you just want to feel full with a food? Protein, fats, bulk solid foods. Simple sugars and liquid calories are the worst. Carbs should be complex in nature and come with fiber bulk. </p>
<p>Source: MD, just casual interest in nutrition. Honestly med school had pretty minimal nutrition teaching. Await better answer from dietician.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
