		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that your brain wants to assume there's a &quot;correct&quot; frame of reference.</p>
<p>That is, there's a way to step outside of your frame of reference and see things as they &quot;actually are&quot;. This is not possible if relativity is true.  Reality depends on your frame of reference.</p>
<p>If you are moving at close to the speed of light, it looks like light is moving away from you in concentric circles, and everything else in the Universe is moving past you at the speed of light. To you, all light from items you are moving toward is blue shifted.</p>
<p>To an observer in a different frame of reference, the unshifted light that you emit is blue shifted as you move toward them and the light that you see the observer emit (which is blue shifted to you) is normal to them.</p>
<p>That's the &quot;relative&quot; in relativity.</p>
<p>In the same way, people talk about earth centered versus sun centered views of the world.  Either one could be correct.</p>
<p>I could choose a frame of reference where the earth is the stationary center of the universe and everything rotates around it.  It's a great frame of reference for doing basic physics experiments.</p>
<p>I could choose a frame of reference where the sun is the center of the universe and everything rotates around it. That's a great frame of reference for planetary physics.</p>
<p>I could choose a frame of reference where the center of the Milky Way is the center of the universe and everything rotates around it.  That's going to be useful frame of reference for astrophysics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People moving at different speeds measure space and time differently. You sort of take your own space and time with you. By analogy, you take your own &quot;left&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; with you when you turn. It may not agree with other people's &quot;left&quot; and &quot;forward.&quot; You would no longer agree on the direction objects move (I say it's &quot;left+forward&quot;, you might say it's just &quot;left&quot;), but we'd still agree on the speed.</p>
<p>The way space and time change as you change your speed &quot;conspire&quot;, in a way, to keep the speed of light constant.</p>
<p>You can imagine the concentric circles in your diagram as being slices of a cone. Here it is as the X emitting the signals sees the cone:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lXpfYUE.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/lXpfYUE.png</a></p>
<p>And you're imagining that if the emitter was moving, another observer would see this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/n9tn86g.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/n9tn86g.png</a></p>
<p>But that's not how spacetime works. Another observer would actually see things like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/i4kurZf.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/i4kurZf.png</a></p>
<p>If you overlay this on the original diagram, you see that the lines that make up the sides of the cone still have the same angle - that's the constant speed of light. The observers will disagree about the &quot;locations&quot; of points inside or outside the cone, but <em>on</em> the cone nothing changes:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been a lot of great responses to this question already - but I would like to add that the YouTube channel Minute Physics have been creating a series of special relativity videos that explain in very great detail how to think of things exactly like this. I highly recommend that you take a look.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are always bad answers when there's a question on the basics of relativity from a non physicist.</p>
<p>Plenty of true, accurate answers. Horrible, however, to read as someone who doesn't study physics. Or maybe I'm overreacting, but I'm gonna try for understanding anyway.</p>
<p>So, you've noted that weird shit has to happen if the speed of something is constant. That is an accurate assessment, you've in agreement with physicists, alive and dead.</p>
<p>One of the things that has to happen is that speeds can't be added to each other straight up. We arrived at that conclusion back in the 1880s, basically from the same question you've asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental evidence suggests that the speed of Light seems to be constant.</li>
<li>&quot;Huh? That's absured. You'd get [issues like you've stated]&quot;</li>
<li>Yeah ... you'd need for speed to be added like so: (Lorentz did he math.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorentz was trying to rescue a precursor theory best described as &quot;stationary aether&quot; but the problem he was solving was indeed the whole constant speed problem, and the maths he worked out turned out to not only work in theory, but was actually how space / time / speed worked (a conclusion reached based on later observations).</p>
<p>So, what's the solution? Well, lets see</p>
<ul>
<li>You know how length is clear cut? 1 meter is 1 meter? Yeah, no.</li>
<li>You know how time is intrinsic and absolute? 1 second is equal to 1 second? Yeah, no.</li>
<li>You know how speed is easy to work with? I'm moving 1 meter per second faster than you, that car is moving 1 meter faster than me, the car is moving 2 meters faster than you? Yeah, no.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reality turned out to be more interesting. I heartily recommend trying to understand the wiki page on lorentz contraction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length\_contraction" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length\_contraction</a></a>, but I'm going to try to give a non-mathematical explanation below.</p>
<p>In order to have a speed be constant, it turns out that that this speed needs to be a maximum speed. By this I mean, if it isn't then the maths doesn't work out.</p>
<p>No matter how much you accelerate, you end up moving at a speed closer to this max speed (c), but never quite reaching it. Further, the only way to move at this max speed is to start moving at that speed, and then never changing your speed. Light does this. It moves at c, the maximum possible speed when traveling through space. I feel it helps in understanding to stop thinking about this as &quot;light speed&quot;, because the interesting weird thing isn't the fact that light happens to move at c, it's that c is a thing at all and light happens to move at c.</p>
<p>To be clear, Lorentz calculated a bunch of things to show that this kind of physics was theoretically possible. The maths/physics required had a solution which was internally consistent. Einstein later came up with an explanation which allowed us to say &quot;we think it's this way because of these reasons&quot;. Lorentz had earlier given us tools so that we could say &quot;It could work like this, I guess, so what we're measuring isn't crazy&quot;. We knew thanks to Lorentz that if there was a constant speed, it had to be a maximum speed and speeds had to be added in a way like what he proposed, but not necessarily exactly like that. It turned out that everything worked exactly like that, because Lorentz was super good at his job.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to your picture? Well, apart from speed being weird, time and space also get time at the party. In order for these speed shenanigans to work, Lorentz calculated that space had to contract as well.</p>
<p>So, specifically, in the picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both observers agree that the speed of light is constant.</li>
<li>The observers to not agree about how light seems to move away from themselves and the other observer.
<ul>
<li>Both observers measure, accurately, a situation which looks like they are the stationary observer and the other guy is moving.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This can happen because space is being pushed together in relation to speed. Put yourself in the position of one of the observers. You will see a situation that looks like the stationary observer, because we are always stationary compared to ourselves. Place physical markers along the north / south, east / west axis, such that you have a cross centered on you, with markers 1 meter apart going north / south, as well as east / west. Now ask your friend, the other observer, about your cross.</p>
<p>He or she will not agree that they are all 1 meter apart. He or she will say that the north south markers are, indeed, 1 meter apart, but the east / west ones are slightly less than one meter apart. Both of you will agree that the distance between the markers seems to shift if you are moving at a new speed.</p>
<p>Similar weirdness happens to time as well, but that is chapter 2 of a very long book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both diagrams are correct. The speed of light is the same in both frames, however the frequency and angular distribution of the light waves is different in the two frames. Assuming the light source is monochromatic and isotropic in the rest frame of the source, it will be neither in any frame where the source is moving.</p>
<p>The change in frequency due to the motion of the source is the Doppler effect, and the change in the angular distribution is called relativistic beaming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
