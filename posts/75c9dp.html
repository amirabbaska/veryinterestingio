During a blackout from drinking, the prefrontal cortex is inhibited, which is responsible for a large portion of encoding events into short-term memory. Information must be encoded into short-term memory before it is stored into long-term memory. Therefore, because this information can’t be properly encoded and stored into short-term memory, the memory is unable to be processed into long-term memory via the hippocampus. </p>
<p>Think of a livestream that’s not being saved.</p>
<p>So basically the information is never recorded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting side note: there are two major sources of memory processes, the hippocampus and the amygdala. The hippocampus controls contextual memory processes while the amygdala controls cued memory processes.</p>
<p>So in fear conditioning, you put a rat in a novel environment with a floor that you can electrify and you pair a tone with a mild electrical shock. This is very scary to the animal. The following day, you can put the animal back in the chamber and it will freeze, showing that it is afraid of the context in which the shock occurred. Then you can place the animal in the chamber after you have in some way modified the floor and walls. Now the animal will not freeze until you play the tone, so it's afraid of the cue that led to the shock.</p>
<p>Now what's interesting is that alcohol effects the hippocampus and the amygdala differently. If you dose rats with alcohol, they will show issues with contextual memory, suggesting a hippocampus like deficit, but will show no loss of cued memory, indicating that the amygdala is not impaired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blackouts affect the hippocampus. While in a blackout you can sleep, walk, talk, and have sufficed motor skills.  (I say suffice and not exceptional) The hippocampus, a brain structure vital to learning and memory, is likely vulnerable to damage from heavy and chronic alcohol consumption. ... It also appears vulnerable to damage from chronic, heavy alcohol consumption</p>

<p>Alcohol primarily interferes with the ability to form new long–term memories, leaving intact previously established long–term memories and the ability to keep new information active in memory for brief periods. As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, so does the magnitude of the memory impairments. Large amounts of alcohol, particularly if consumed rapidly, can produce partial (i.e., fragmentary) or complete (i.e., en bloc) blackouts, which are periods of memory loss for events that transpired while a person was drinking. Blackouts are much more common among social drinkers—including college drinkers—than was previously assumed, and have been found to encompass events ranging from conversations to intercourse. Mechanisms underlying alcohol–induced memory impairments include disruption of activity in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new auotbiographical memories

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frankly don't think the top comment here is accurate in highlighting the inhibition of the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) as the main mechanism. Memory encoding occurs primarily in the hippocampus, and I would say it is primarily inhibition of neurons here (due to alcohol decreasing neuronal activity) that is interfering with memory formation. This seems to be supported by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21769024" target="_blank">this article</a> I found in the literature, though it is just 1 paper.</p>
<p>The PFC may have a role in long term mekory, but in terms of the loss of memory encoding this is mainly done in the hippocampus, not the PFC</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
