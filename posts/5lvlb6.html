		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, pharmacist here. The most general way to understand the skin, drug absorption, lotions, and so forth is to think about how oil and water don't (easily) mix. To cross the skin barrier from outside of your skin to the inside, generally any molecule has to cross an outer lipophilic layer (which likes fat), then through a hydrophilic layer (which likes water), and then through an inner lipophilic layer. Some transdermal (across the skin) delivery systems can even increase the permeability of the skin, making it easier for molecules to get across. To address your initial question with creams and lotions, remember oil and water. The goal is to increase hydration or rather, to avoid moisture loss. So lotions on a basic level restore water. And if you put something occlusive (a lipophilic barrier like a layer of Vaseline, creams which have oils and fats in them to do the same, a bandage, etc.), you basically trap water in your skin. This is why lotions and creams work better if you put them on when your skin is still damp from a shower or bath - you trap more moisture. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(Dimethyl sulfoxide) is a transport agent not quite approved for human use, but works great in animals for getting medicine through the skin into the muscles and joints. It is so effective that even trace chemicals, like your own hand cream, can make it through during application.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that you are asking about how moisturizers work, and not the mechanism whereby how cells in your skin actually pull moisture into your body. </p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of moisturizers. The first is occlusive, which is a physical barrier preventing moisture from escaping. (Petroleum jelly, oils, silicones etc.) The second type is humectant, which draws moisture towards itself. (Glycerin, hyaluronic acid etc.) Most moisturizers in the market are composed of a mixture of occlusive and humectant ingredients so that moisture gets actively attracted to the surface of your skin and gets trapped by the occlusive barrier, unable to escape back out into the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
