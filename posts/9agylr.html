I assume the boat was shut off and chilling. So, how do they know when to drop the anchor? How long are anchors? Do they not use anchors when the ocean is too deep? Is there a safety mechanism to cut off the anchor if shit hits the fan? Cheers, my semens</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So, how do they know when to drop the anchor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have depth finders and navigational charts or GPS to know how deep the water is and if they can drop anchor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long are anchors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends on the ship and the conditions. The longer the chain, the more stable your ship will be but also you have to haul the thing around. Some quick research says you want about a 4:1 ratio (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9agylr/eli5_how_do_boat_anchors_work_at_sea/e4voxny/" target="_blank">or &quot;scope&quot;</a>) on the depth of the water you'll be anchoring in (so 4x the depth) plus about twice the length of the ship (in good conditions; more chain for rough conditions). Some more quick research finds <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a28701/uss-ford-anchor-test-video/" target="_blank">this</a> which says [edit: of aircraft carriers]: &quot;The chain is 1,440 feet long and each link weighs 136 pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for large ships, the anchor at the end of the chain isn't doing the bulk of the work to keep the ship still, the chain itself is. The chain is heavy, so it wants to pull straight down. When the ship moves, it will lift the chain off the bottom, which will try to pull the ship back. And it creates a lot of drag on the bottom, so the ship can't drag it around. Even on a small ship, you need to have enough line so that the force acting on the anchor is as horizontal to the bottom of the ocean as possible. Meaning, pulling directly <em>up</em> on an anchor is easy and will just pull it out of the sediment on the bottom. Pulling it <em>sideways</em>, through the sediment is very difficult. And if you're near the shore or otherwise above the continental shelf, you have to account for tides. Too little line or chain and the tide will lift your ship enough that it'll lift the anchor off the bottom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they not use anchors when the ocean is too deep?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do not. But there's not much danger. If you're near the shore, you need to keep your ship from moving at all because you risk running aground or running into a reef or running into another ship. But in the open ocean if you're drifting slightly, there's nothing to run into, and everything around you is going to be drifting together. That means that if people are swimming around off the ship, the ocean currents will carry them in the same direction as the ship, so you'll stay more or less together (assuming there's little to no wind; if it's windy, it wouldn't be safe to be swimming anyway).</p>
<p>Sailboats can do another thing called &quot;<del>luffing</del> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9agylr/eli5_how_do_boat_anchors_work_at_sea/e4vnohz/" target="_blank">heaving to</a>&quot; which means putting the ship at an angle to the wind such that the wind doesn't push on the sails in any direction, the sails are just flapping. When done correctly, you can keep the ship fairly stationary. The ocean current (if there is one) and waves may push the boat in one direction, but as soon as it starts moving it moves relative to the air, which fills the sails a small bit and slows the boat down again. It's not going to keep you perfectly still, but it's good enough to hold still for a while in open ocean without an anchor.</p>
<p>Edit: Several people have mentioned sea anchors, which are essentially a water &quot;parachute&quot; like device that creates drag in the water so the wind can't blow you around too much. Won't keep you still, but it would prevent you from going too far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a safety mechanism to cut off the anchor if shit hits the fan?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: I understood this question to mean &quot;The anchor is already down and the ship needs to GTFO&quot; rather than &quot;The anchor is on the way down in an uncontrolled fashion.&quot; The answer to the latter is definitely a &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Depends on the ship and how likely it is that they'll need to get rid of it quickly. There are emergency brakes to try to prevent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLLBhIJbVFs" target="_blank">this</a> from happening, although obviously they don't always work. I don't know for military ships, but I would think they would have a way to very quickly cut the chain and release the anchor if they had it deployed and needed to get gone in a hurry. That said, when military ships are deployed they rarely stop.</p>
<p>Edit: Several people have pointed out the &quot;bitter end&quot; of the chain, which is where the chain is attached more or less to the ship. There is a pin that can be removed (with a sledge hammer and great force) to disconnect the anchor chain if needed, like if the anchor gets caught on the bottom and cannot be raised. Military personnel have also pointed out that the time it takes to recognize an incoming danger is sufficient to properly raise anchor, especially since you're not going to be dropping anchor where a fight is likely anyway. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm definitely not a sailor or anything, I just did some quick research and tried to remember other things I've read over the years. I know I've made at least one mistake so make sure you do your own research, eh? Also, go read Chris A Jackson's <em>Scimitar Moon</em>: it's got pirates and magic and strong female leads, and Jackson grew up around sailboats and knows how to sail so the jargon is all accurate (I'm just dumb and haven't read it in a while).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anchors are big heavy things that attach you to the seabed. The ship remains attached to the seabed by a long cable the length of which is usually determined by the size of the vessel. </p>
<p>Usually a ship will move back and forth over the cable until the appropriate amount of cable has been paid out and it is the length of this cable, which on big ships is heavy metal, that keeps the vessel in position rather than the anchor itself which just attaches to the seabed.</p>
<p>The moment a ship let's go anchor, it is obliged to indicate this to other vessels by showing a ball from its yardarm during the day or an all round white light at night.
Naval tradition says that warships will also fly their jack from the front of the ship.</p>
<p>The water can be too deep to anchor even for the big ships this is particularly true in large oceans, instead vessels can often drift with little to no engine power.</p>
<p>The best places to anchor are called anchorages these are marked on navigational charts and you should use these as they are like parking bays for ships. It is likely that the ship was anchored in one of these places.</p>
<p>A ship will have a depth sounder on board which shoots a sonar beam down to the seabed to determine how much water is underneath the ship. This, along with the information on the chart allow them to decide whether or not to drop anchor.</p>
<p>Just like parking, there are rules and you can't just drop anchor anywhere, if you do you can get in trouble with the coast guard. In some countries you need permission from the coast guard to drop anchor or depart an anchorage, not dissimilar to air traffic control.</p>
<p>Finally there is usually a way to disconnect from your anchor in an emergency although this means severing the cable and losing your anchor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common idea of how an anchor looks is somewhat archaic. ⚓ The type of anchor in that emoji hasn't been commonly used for a while. One popular design consists of two parts, a metal shaft connected to a pair of flukes, shaped like, and conveniently named, a plow anchor. Boats like to anchor in mud or sand. As the boat tugs on the anchor, the anchor burrows deeper into the bottom. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>22 year US Navy here.   When we do swim calls at sea, we are always in fairly deep water, deeper than our anchor chain length.  We will come to a stop turning off our engines and drift, but we only do these on deployments, and maybe once during a deployment if we are lucky. </p>
<p>As far as the anchor goes, we drop based on charted positions and depths.  The process we go through allows us to fairly accurately drop the anchor in the desired position and then reverse slowly as we pay out extra chain to further weigh down the ship.  Typically the anchor will stay put and the ship will turn around the anchor depending on the current.  If we need to leave, we will pull up the anchor and get underway... </p>
<p>As far as emergency procedures go, our engines are powerful enough to drag the anchor.  We will pull the anchor up as normal, but could me making way away from the anchorage at the same time, even though I've never seen this done.  Our desire would be to catch any potential problems early before we would need to do this.</p>
<p>Military ships will anchor in ports without piers large enough to support us, and sometimes for loading weapons or fuel away from shore for safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
