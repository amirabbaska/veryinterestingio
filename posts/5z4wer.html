<p>It doesn't have to be resigned to landing in your sink, pouring a mug of cold water versus boiling hot water sounds remarkably different. In fact, I can tell my shower at home has heated up when the sound changes.</p>
<p>Despite how fascinating this is, the answer is unfortunately rather mundane. The viscosity of water changes as the temperature of the water changes, and this results in the change to the sound.</p>
<p>Viscosity is how thick or &quot;gloopy&quot; the water is, while water is not very viscous at all the viscosity still drops by a factor of 4 or 5 between 0C and 100C. This is because the van der waal's, intermolecular forces become comparatively weaker as the random thermal motion of the water becomes stronger.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of responses to this thread, but none particularly quantitative. I am a little bit disappointed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri_4dDvcZeM" target="_blank">in the YouTube video</a>, and in fact a lot of the responses which seem to say very little. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The speed of sound can be understood by looking at the equation that governs solid mechanics. Basically, if you take the governing equations (known as Navier equations), then look at a travelling wave solution, you find that the wave travels at a certain speed. These speeds depend on the type of wave sought, but they essentially depend on the material properties of the medium. They are <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63b8a40f17d7b1d5ba69235f996ae2a09b253bf2" target="_blank">here</a>. They are divided into what are known as P-waves and S-waves. There is more reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now for a fluid, there is only one relevant speed, as S-waves are negligible. Thus the formula for the speed of sound (P-waves) reduces to <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c618951d93fe1e71475ebb7abb24f0a925b2321" target="_blank">this</a>, and so it is inversely proportional to the root of the density of the medium and proportional to the root of the bulk modulus, K.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between temperature and density is more complicated, and I am not sure of a back-of-the-envelope explanation. However it is typically the case that increasing temperature will decrease the density, at least above 4-5C for water. You can <a href="http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem1/L21/2.html" target="_blank">see the trend here</a>, and notice that the trend is not true from 0C to 4C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus we can conclude that increasing temperature leads to decreased density in the case of water above room temperature. Thus the speed of sound will increase. Assuming that the wavelength of the disturbance (which will be complex in general) is fixed, then frequency and speed are proportional (c = f*lambda), and thus higher speed leads to higher frequency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The above assumption of a fixed wavelength can be thought of as tapping the bottom of a glass filled with water. In this case, the frequency you hear will largely correspond to the standing wave where a quarter of the wavelength is the distance between base and surface. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now there is a well known effect known as the Hot Chocolate Effect that was studied by <a href="http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.13080" target="_blank">Crawford in 1982</a>. The idea is that the pitch you hear when you tap a glass of liquid will first decrease, then increase as you add and stir hot chocolate powder. The point is that the addition of the powder and stirring will cause the formation of bubbles. The addition of bubbles serves to increase the compressibility of the medium, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_modulus" target="_blank">decreases the Bulk Modulus, K</a>. The effect is to decrease the speed of sound, hence decrease the frequency and the pitch.</p>
</li>
<li>In the above hot chocolate explanation, the point is that as the fluid and powder are stirred to equilibrium, the gas bubbles disappear, and hence the pitch should increase again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now I want to point out some issues.</p>
<p>First, it has been pointed out by u/Robo-Connery that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5z4wer/why_does_the_sound_of_cold_water_hitting_steel/devbz9z/" target="_blank">it has to do with viscosity</a>, but I do not understand this. In fact, going online, this seems to be a common answer on forums. However, I don't understand why viscosity is seen as a direct mechanism when density and viscosity are generally two separate and independent characteristics. One can increase temperature and observe one property increase and the other decrease. <a href="http://www.flowcontrolnetwork.com/how-does-an-increase-in-temperature-affect-liquids/" target="_blank">Here is a source that indicates this</a>.</p>
<p>I don't understand why viscosity is being cited as an item of importance when the sound wave propagates through the fluid as a pressure wave, and so is independent of fluid viscosity.</p>
<p>Next, I am aware that my answer seems to indicate higher frequencies for hot water, but it's not clear to me that this is the case based on the YouTube videos. I think that the answer may be more complicated. Hot water, when agitated, leads to more bubbles. Hence there is a competition between the aforementioned bubble effect (so the bulk modulus K of the medium), and the natural changes in density due to increase temperature.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, the issue is that you may get a different answer between if you simply disturb a glass filled with hot water, or you disturb the glass filled with water while stirring. In this case, the change in the pitch may depend on the rate that you stir the water.</p>
<p>A lot of inaccuracies might be present in this post. They're just late-night thoughts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
