		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spent nuclear fuel just doesn't produce enough heat to make it useful for producing steam. The amount of power you'd get out of it that way simply would never pay for the cost of building and running the system.</p>
<p>It can be recycled however. Spent fuel still contains a lot of useful radioisotopes and there are types of reactors designed to recycle the spent fuel back into usable nuclear fuel. The problem is, that on top of the normal political concerns with nuclear reactors, recycling can produce plutonium, which is used in nuclear weapons. Because it is very difficult to tell the difference between a fuel recycling plant and a weapon-making plant from outside, many countries have decided to not recycle to avoid political and diplomatic troubles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just not cost effective to maintain a facility that can get power from the spent fuel.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Decay_heat_illustration.PNG" target="_blank">this image</a> from wikipedia, after a mere 10 days power output is down to less than 0.5% of the original power output. Because of the nature of the graph, a year later it will probably still be about 0.1%. Clearly this is enough heat to warrant powered-passive cooling (like a computer fan, as opposed to powered cooling, such as a refrigerator).</p>
<p>Any power station built to collect this power would produce 1000x less energy than a regular power station, which means the energy it produces would cost 1000x as much, assuming the operating cost of the facility is similar to a regular power station.</p>
<p>It's cheaper to run a cooling station than to run a power station that doesn't produce any power.</p>
<p>Edit: obligatory pun, it's not 10able</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After three years in a pool we place the bundles in a cask and place them on a concrete pad to sit there until the country decides to develop a permanent storage facility or to reprocess the fuel. Reprocessing would make the most sense since over the 6 years that the fuel is in the core only, approximately, 3% of the fuel is expended.  </p>
<p>As for powering anything else the casks are all around 100 degrees so you are unlikely to get much energy from it. </p>
