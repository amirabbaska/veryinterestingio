		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple explanation - </p>
<p>This has been done before.</p>
<p>&quot;In the most dramatic stages of the Cold War, Russia and the United States were testing nuclear bombs left and right, and due to fears of a long-range nuclear missile or a satellite delivery system for a nuclear warhead, all eyes were on the skies. </p>
<p>The United States had launched a series of tests code named Project Fishbowl, which were high-altitude nuclear weapons tests. The most impressive and historic test in this Project was Starfish Prime. On July 9th, 1962, a 1.4 megaton nuclear bomb was detonated approximately 250 miles above the surface of Earth.</p>
<p>What would happen if a nuclear bomb went off in space?</p>
<p>First of all, since there is no atmosphere in space, there was no iconic mushroom cloud, nor a blast wave (which is where most of the damage of a nuclear bomb comes from on Earth). Instead, there was an intense outpouring of not only heat and light, but high-intensity radiation in the form of gamma rays and X-rays, with no atmosphere to interrupt their path. Visually, the blast was roughly spherical, and the wave of radiation and light expanded to light up the sky.</p>
<p>On the surface of the planet, vivid auroras of light would be seen for thousands of miles within minutes of the blast, because the charged particles from the blast would immediately begin interacting with Earth’s magnetic field. Imagine the aurora borealis, more commonly known as the Northern Lights, except spread across thousands of kilometers above the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Those ribbons of light and charged particle streams would continue to be seen for hours or even days after the blast (depending on the size of the explosion). In a nuclear blast, there is also quite a bit of debris, which would burn up in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, and heavy ions would also be absorbed by the atmospheric molecules of the planet. These extra radioactive molecules are actually useful in certain ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more worrying than the huge amount of radiation being dropped into Earth’s atmosphere is the detonation’s impact on electromagnetic signals in a massive area beneath the blast. Essentially, those highly charged, rapidly moving electrons will create a small and incredibly powerful magnetic field, also called an EMP (electromagnetic pulse). You’ve probably seen this in sci-fi movies many times; an EMP bomb cuts off all electronic power within a given area (most famously, perhaps, in The Matrix Trilogy).</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the long-term effects of a nuclear weapon detonating in space, that radioactive material falling into the atmosphere isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it dissipates and spreads around the entire planet. Those extra molecules imparted by that nuclear blast can now be accurately measured as a means of dating things, such as trees, wine, and animals. While that may be one useful thing about nuclear testing in space, that certainly doesn’t make the whole process any more sensible.</p>
<p>There were only a handful of high-altitude nuclear detonation tests in the 1950 and 1960s, but in total, more than 2,000 nuclear detonations were conducted on Earth between 1945 and 1998.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, nice. At first a thought &quot;Crap, chemistry, I have nothing to add&quot; but then found this is a physics question.</p>
<p>As others have stated there was a test in 1962 of just that.</p>
<p>The radioactive particles are high in the atmosphere, that means they are distributed far, and as such do not cause a great spike in local measurements, as such they are relatively harmless. They can still cause bad things (cancer) in unlucky individuals, but given the explosion is high the material isn't forming a local cloud as you have with closer-to-earth tests. Of course if the fallout happens to get in some jetstream-winds they might kept closer together and do not distribute that far. </p>
<p>The particles would decay in the atmosphere or land wherever over time (weeks, months, years).</p>
<p>You get some radiation (belts) in the atmosphere, mostly high-energy electrons that can last for days or traces for some few years.</p>
<p>The effect of such a blast is not in the physical fallout but in the EMP (electromagnetic pulse) and in said radiation belts that can damage electrical systems, as power lines or satellites. In the 60s there was a lot loss of satellites due to the EMP and the radiation. It is unclear if something would happen again today as satellites are better shielded against natural radiation (back then they did not know that the natural levels could be higher than the ones of the blast). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the yield. The US did several exoatmospheric nuclear tests in the 60's. The radiation would get trapped in the Van Allen Belts and stay there until it decayed. It would also produce an electromagnetic pulse that could disable any nearby satellites and cause damage or destruction to any electronics on the ground in a wide area underneath the point of the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is referred to as a HAND (high altitude nuclear detonation) and is the Pentagon's worst nightmare - it would be much worse than just putting the nuke on the ground somewhere due to the EMP taking out power lines across America.  The fuses are designed for lightning strikes and wouldn't trip in time to save the transformers.  Basically the whole country would lose power, can you imagine how long it would take to build enough transformers to replace them?  This is the &quot;how fast does society turn to post-apocalypse&quot; question.  Luckily there are few nations capable of getting a nuke to the specific altitude required.  </p>
<p>In somewhere like the UK where the govt put power lines underground, they'd be fine, but America did it cheaper so we have essentially huge antennas above ground :-(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
