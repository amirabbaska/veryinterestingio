		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CDs contain what's called &quot;error correction&quot;.</p>
<p>Think of the music as being a string of numbers. These numbers are basically the values of a line graph, which is just the shape of the sound waveform that gets played back. So the first point is a 0, then the next is a 5, then an 8, then a 5, 0, -5, -8, -5, for instance. That's kind of a sine-wave shape that I just estimated. It's typical of a sound wave.</p>
<p>CDs contain that data. But they also contain <em>extra</em> data. There may be some data that says, &quot;the first 3 pieces add up to 13&quot;. This is error correction.</p>
<p>Let's say there's a scratch that renders the first &quot;5&quot; unreadable. Well, we can see there's a 0 and an 8, and the extra info says they should add up to 13. So even though it's partly damaged, we can tell it should be a 5 in the middle.</p>
<p>Additionally, those different pieces of information are intentionally scattered around the disc a bit, so a scratch is unlikely to ruin enough of them at once to make it impossible to recover the missing data.</p>
<p>The actual amount of information and complexity of the error checking algorithm is more complex than this example, for better resistance to missing data, but it's the same basic idea. Extra information to recover damaged portions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Please refer to the error checking and correction posts. Also, in pressed disks, it's not burned dye that holds the information, but indentations caused by pressing. What's still the same is that damage to the reflective layer is usually more disruptive than damage to the underside of the disk.</p>
<p>That depends on how it is scratched, the sensitivity of the cd player, and the type of data on the CD.</p>
<p>A CD is basically made of four layers, from top to bottom:  </p>
<ul>
<li>a label  </li>
<li>reflective aluminium  </li>
<li>the information layer (dye)  </li>
<li>a protective transparent layer.  </li>
</ul>
<p>When you want to put something on a CD it is translated to a long string of 1s and 0s. Next that information is burned in the information layer: A zero gets a small burn spot, a one doesn't get a burn spot. </p>
<p>When a CD player wants to read the disk, it points a very small laser at the underside of the disk. When the laser hits a black burn spot (a &quot;zero&quot;) the light is absorbed/stopped by that black burn and will never be reflected by the aluminium above. When the laser hits a clear spot (a &quot;one&quot;), the laser goes right through the information layer and gets reflected back by the aluminium.</p>
<p>So, scratches to the upper side of the disk, damaging the reflective aluminium layer, are really bad: When the aluminium is damaged, the laser will never be reflected. Scratches to the underside only cause the disk to skip when it really changes the path of the laser or truly blocks it. So, (deep) scratches on the top side are usually really bad, scratches on the underside may not be as bad.</p>
<p>Whether or not a scratched disk plays also depends on your CD-player. Some are really sensitive and can't handle a slight change in the strength of the light, some can handle it better. When your laser lens is dirty, so that the light level is already lower, the sensitivity to scratches  may also increase(if you begin with less light, you don't have a lot of margin for scratches). </p>
<p>It also depends on the type of data: You can skip a few places with music (missing a few 1s and 0s), but with data (CD-rom) your data is probably &quot;corrupted&quot; (you're missing information that is vital to the program or file; you need every one and zero).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audio CDs are hideously inefficiently encoded - although to be fair when the standards were being written decent lossless compression (e.g. FLAC) was nowhere to be seen, even good lossy compression (e.g. MP3) was still a way off. So Audio CDs used two channels of 44.1KHz 16-bit raw audio samples, plus some extra error correction and detection bits.</p>
<p>That means that there is a relatively low data density on the disc. The fact that it is error correction <em>and detection</em> means that even if a chunk of data is read and is so badly corrupted that the ECC algorithm cannot fix it, it still knows the data is corrupt.</p>
<p>In audio CD players they had a 0-255 volume level built in and for every uncorrectable sample it turned it down one notch and played the last known good sample again, only turning it back up again when correct data is seen. This led to a gradual turning down of the levels around duff samples rather than a sudden dropout which would have cause an audible 'thump' from the speakers.</p>
<p>This is why even a hole in the disc up to 1/8&quot; could be unheard in the output.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Vesiculus wrote a very comprehensive answer. I'd like to add that audio CDs were designed to handle dirt and scratches: they contain a lot of error-correction data (extra data that's used to reconstruct the original if it wasn't read properly). And many players use oversampling, which reads the same data multiple times (2, 8, or 16 times, possibly more) and uses the result it got the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Also, the orientation of scratches makes a difference. Data is arranged in concentric rings on the disc. Scratches that cross perpendicular to these rings cause only a small amount to damage to each, which is easily correctable. Scratches which are oriented so they wipe out too much consecutive data cause unrecoverable errors. (This is why manufacturers always tell you to wipe discs from the center to the edge.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
