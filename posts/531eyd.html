		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We knew that this process, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_welding" target="_blank">cold welding</a>, was possible well before going into space. Even though this process may seem exotic, it follows from pretty basic physical considerations. The basic idea of this effect is technique is that just like you can break a crystal into two pieces, you can also put the pieces back together. It's a bit like taking apart a jigsaw puzzle and then putting it back together. Because the pieces can fit back together, they can simply snap in place when you put them in the right orientation. When you put the crystal back together, the electrons won't &quot;know&quot; that they should belong to different pieces as Feynman once famously put it. In effect you are creating metallic bonds across both pieces and it's as though the crystal was never broken apart in the first place.</p>
<p>You might get a better sense for what happens by looking at how this process occurs under an electron microscope, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iihMpJn.gifv" target="_blank">as shown in this clip</a>. Here researchers took two gold nanowires and brought them close to one another. Because both pieces had the same orientation of their crystalline network (called the lattice), at one point the two pieces fell into place. As a result, the new piece acts like a pristine piece of metal. In fact, you can break this piece apart and put it back together with no meaningful loss in its electrical conduction or other properties, as described in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v5/n3/abs/nnano.2010.4.html" target="_blank">this paper</a> from which I took this clip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I design vacuum chambers for a living so maybe I can provide some insight.  &quot;Cold welding&quot; happens in high, or ultra-high vacuum environments when very clean metals touch.  It doesn't work like most people seem to think it does, it's not like you just touch two pieces of metal together and they instantly become one.  It's more like they stick together some.  Under high enough pressure they can bond.  Anyway since the conditions can be recreated on earth I would guess we would have known about it before we went into space.  We had diffusion pumps back in the 1920's that could create ultra-high vacuum environments in the lab.  Also, the idea of metals bonding under pressure isn't something that just happens in space, it happens all the time with fasteners.  Anytime you have two similar metals under high pressure they can bond, it's just easier in space.  They sell lubricants to keep it happening with bolts and stuff here on earth.  Anyone with experience with aircraft I would guess would know about this and know how to prevent it from happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every piece of metal has a thin layer of ceramic on the surface called an oxide layer. This layer is what keeps metals from sticking to each other (it's also why metals rust). The goal of welding is to break this layer (through heat, friction, force, etc) to combine two metal pieces. It's not hard to break the oxide layer; once damaged however, the oxide layer can take oxygen from the atmosphere and regenerate. In space there is no oxygen; a damaged oxide layer stays damaged and two metal pieces with naked surfaces will cold weld if they come into contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They're just so damn flat that enough atoms line up in a flat plane and bang, the atoms attract and make bonds, like they were unbroken metal. This happens in space once the atmosphere clinging to their surfaces evaporates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>cold welding and galling are essentially the same thing, and galling has been widely known in engineering since we started using high strength fasteners (high strength stainless steel, or titanium).</p>
<p>it happens when the hardness of the nut and the screw are nearly the same, as you tightening the fastener the pressure between the treads can cause it to gall and basically fuse.</p>
<p>general rule of thumb is you don't use the same material for both the fastener and the nut element... you can use two stainless steel parts, but they will be dissimilar enough alloys in their hardness that one will give first, while the other remains intact... usually the nut is the softer of the two, since that part is easier to replace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
