<p>The control center for body temperature is more concerned about the temperature in your brain and other vital organs; so if your core is too warm, you will sweat all over. The will happen no matter how cold your feet are. Cold feet is less of a problem than a brain that is too hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your feet sweat, they will get cold. Some people (like me) have feet that sweat regardless of the temp if they cannot breathe. When your feet sweat and the temp is low, they will stay cold as long as they are wet. </p>
<p>To combat this at work, I wear slip on dress shoes and take them off under my desk while sitting there, which allows my feet to breathe and stay dry, and thus warm. They slip on easily enough they most people never notice. When I ride motorcycles long distance I'll be riding 20 hours a day or more. Obviously removing my boots would be practical or safe, so I use anti-monkey butt powder between my toes, dri-max socks, and gore-tex boots. I've found this combination to work the best for me, but it is expensive. At home I wear real sheep fur lined slippers. So warm and cozy and they breathe, unlike the synthetic lined ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build on what others have said, your brain cares a lot more about it's core temperature than the temperature of your fingers and toes. Other than sweating when too warm, or shivering when too cold, the primary method the brain uses to regulate your temperature is by deciding how much heat to lose through your extremities.</p>
<p>Think of your hands and feet like radiators. There is a lot of surface area and they are usually in contact with the floor or with surfaces you are holding, so if you are too warm your body will send lots of blood to your hands and feet and they will feel really warm because they are purposefully radiating away lots of extra heat your body is trying to get rid of. (After you do a lot of exercise, feel how warm your hands or feet are, they are probably burning hot).  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when you are too cold, your body restricts the amount of heat it sends to your toes and hands because (1) those appendages can handle cold temperatures a lot better than your internal organs, and (2) your brain knows heat that goes that far away from your core will just be lost right away because your hands and feet are exposed to the elements so it's not worth &quot;wasting&quot; heat trying to keep them warm.</p>
<p>What's my point with all of this? <strong>If you have cold feet, it's because your body is colder than it wants to be, not because your feet themselves are cold.</strong> Don't worry about warming up your feet directly, that will help, but so will just putting an extra blanket over your body and raising your overall temperature. It's impossible to have cold feet while feeling hot in the rest of your body. Put on and extra sweater or blanket, then your core temperature goes up and your feet will warm themselves up real quick as your body shunts it's excess heat out to your toes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
