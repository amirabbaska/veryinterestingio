<p>Imagine you mixed a gatorade with water 50/50.  That dilutes the Gatorade taste.  Imagine you take that water back out.  It now tastes more gatorade-y.  Because it's a higher percent Gatorade compared to total mass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is &quot;stronger&quot; in the sense that there is more of it per given mass. IF you are measuring by mass, fresh herbs have a higher amount of water in them, which increases its mass. Dry herbs lack water and thus to get the same weight as fresh herb you need more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drying and Desiccation remove water, and with it both <em>weight</em> and <em>volume</em>. Since cooking is either &quot;measured&quot; or &quot;eyeballed&quot; based on either weight or volume (i.e. &quot;1/4 teaspoon&quot; or &quot;2 grams&quot; of whatever) human-eye similar, human-hand similar for &quot;pinch of&quot;, and all the &quot;real measurements&quot; need to take that water, or its absence, into consideration.</p>
<p>The rules are there to keep you from wrecking something if you are used to one kind (dry/wet) and suddenly find yourself with something else (wet/dry).</p>
<p>Weight is the &quot;one true faith&quot; of baking and and such. &quot;1 cup of sifted flour&quot; can be radically different from another, but &quot;half a pound of sifted flour&quot; is always the same amount of flour.</p>
<p>Additionally, the strength of a given fresh/moist seasoning can be totally different between leaves, even from the same plant. But after drying and whatnot you tend to get a more homogeneous result. More plants were probably involved and so the distribution of material tends to even out.</p>
<p>Finally getting seasoning <em>out</em> of a dish is like trying to get pee out of a pool. So all the wisdom tends to be in the form of cautions. Since it's easier to accidentally over-season using the dry herbs the old saying is that it's stronger.</p>
<p>There is no consistent measure of herbal strength. This means that &quot;one leaf&quot; or whatever (bay leaf aside) is pretty useless. This has some real world health issues. &quot;Herbal Teas&quot; and &quot;Herbal Remedies&quot; for example, are infamous for their inconsistencies. People can and do damage their livers (etc.) because the strength of active compounds can vary radically by day and time of harvest or even which side of the plant the leaves are taken from.</p>
<p>While the leaves are fresh you can usually tell how potent a given fraction will be. You'll see experienced chefs crushing and tasting or smelling fresh herbs to calibrate their expectations. The technique is virtually useless on dry herbs, not totally, but virtually, as the various fractions need the water as a carrier. Sniffing dry herbs can tell you if they've gone totally stale but that's about it.</p>
<p>So in total, dry herbs are hard to judge, more likely to be consistently strong, and are easy to over-use for being smaller and lighter, all of which can trick you into using way too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most herbs the flavor comes from the Essential Oils. These are the substances that contain the &quot;essence&quot; of the plant's flavor and aroma. But the plant also contains a lot of water. If you took a basil leaf and let it dry, you would have the same amount of essential oils left behind so the flavor strength would be the same. But because you lost all that water, there is now much less volume and weight. We measure these ingredients by either volume or weight, so naturally we'll be getting more of the essential oils if we use the same measurement in dried herbs. </p>
<p>1 teaspoon of chopped fresh basil is probably about one basil leaf</p>
<p>1 teaspoon of dried basil - with all the water removed - will be several basil leaves.</p>
<p>More leaves = more essential oils = more flavor/aroma.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
