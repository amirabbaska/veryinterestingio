		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edited</strong> to fold in a couple of great contributions from some other commenters.</p>
<p>The vast majority of smooth curves don't have &quot;closed-form&quot; equations, meaning that you can't write an f(x) in terms of simple functions like polynomials (x, x^2, x^3, ...), exponentials (e^x), trig functions (sin(x), cos(x), ...), and so on.  In fact, a random scribble on paper isn't likely to be a proper function at all, because it would fail to be a one-to-one mapping that satisfies the vertical line test.  As several point out below (/u/idc2011, /u/darksoulisbestsoul and others), though, you can parameterize a such a scribble as the set of functions {x(t), y(t),...}.  So anything below would apply to these individual functions.  (If you'd like an algorithm for finding the parameterizations, I'm afraid I can't help you there.  Wolfram Alpha does a pretty great job, though.) </p>
<p>Nearly any smooth function can be written as a (generally infinite) series of terms in a set of <em>basis functions</em>.  Polynomials form one such basis, so you'd be able to write your curve as</p>
<p>f(x) = A_0 + A_1 x + A_2 x^2 + ... + A_n x^n + ...</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is find the set of coefficients A_0, A_1, ... in order to have an equation for your curve.  For a randomly-drawn curve, there will be a lot of them, so this is best done using a computer.  In fact, there will typically be an infinite number of terms, so you'll never be able to find all of them even with a computer.  You can get an arbitrarily good approximation of your curve, though, by computing as many as you need to get &quot;close enough.&quot;</p>
<p>This polynomial expansion is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series" target="_blank">Taylor Series</a> of the curve.  Sort of.  My background is physics, where we call all polynomial expansions &quot;Taylor Series&quot; (<em>yes, even when it's a MacLaurin series</em>), but
/u/functor7 has a great point below about the distinction.</p>
<p>The set of sines and cosines of different frequencies also form a popular set of basis functions; an expansion in terms of them gives you your curve's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series" target="_blank">Fourier Series</a>.  Fourier Series work best for functions that display periodicity, like sound waves.  I mention them because lots of people are familiar with Fourier analysis and might like the connection to stuff they already know, but they probably won't be best for modeling a random, non-repeating function.</p>
<p>For that matter, polynomials aren't typically your best bet, either, as the aptly-named /u/stoptalkingyourwrong points out :).  I was glad to see him/her and several other posters (like /u/samclifford, /u/DataLaird) mention splines, because I've used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline" target="_blank">b-splines</a> for curve-modeling, and they are in fact the bomb for arbitrary smooth-curve fitting.  I didn't bring them up because they're a little more complicated, but in essence they provide an alternate polynomial basis for the expansion.  The Wikipedia article (linked) is a good place to start if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>If you're more curious about the mathematics of the Taylor Series, /u/dxdydz_dV has a fantastic post below that you should read.  There's tons of other great information in the comments, too.  I have to walk away now, because I really do need to get some work done today, but thanks to everyone for the instructive discussion!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a fun alternate answer... you can come up with a set of piecewise functions where each function is nothing but an equation of a line... the more piecewise functions you use the more accurately it maps to the random drawing, and as the number of piecewise functions approaches infinity the degree of error would approach 0. Essentially you're just vectorizing the shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finding the exact equation won't be possible except in very specific situations (e.g. a straight line). But in many cases, you could approximate it to arbitrary accuracy (or in reality: a level of accuracy limited by how accurate you can measure the coordinates of points on the curve).</p>
<p>Note that between any pair of distinct points you can draw precisely one straight line. This line fits with the equation:</p>
<p>y = a x + b</p>
<p>for unique values of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. If you take three points on your curve, in such a way that they're not all on the same straight line, there is a single parabola, given by</p>
<p>y = a x^2 + b x + c</p>
<p>that can be fitted to cross all three points. If you take four distinct points that do not lie on a parabola, you can fit a single cubic function. And this process can be repeated for larger and larger sets of points.</p>
<p>The more points you take in your sample, the more precisely the approximating polynomial function will match the original curve. The requirement here is that the curve has at most a single y-value for each x-value and that it is smooth enough (specifically: infinitely differentiable). If either of these requirements is not met, then this process will fail to give an accurate approximation at some point.</p>
<p>The equation you end up with is a polynomial of the order of the number of sample points minus one. So if you take 10 sample points, you'll end up with a 9^(th) order polynomial (y = a x^9 + b x^8 + ...).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a simple function? no. However, your best approximation is probably going to come in the form of a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve" target="_blank">Bezier Curves</a>. The mathematics behind this are the basis for all modern digital typefaces (Pioneered by Adobe back in the 80s) and allows for a very good approximation of complex curves. </p>
<p>When translating a raster line drawing (which is what a scanned version of your drawing would be) into a vector drawing, you can pretty much specify how arbitrarily accurate you want the result to be. The more accurate, the more functions and segments there will be, but it will be closer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
