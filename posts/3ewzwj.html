Now, could a modern day human survive in Earth's environment that existed 65 million years ago?  Would the air be breathable?  How about temperature?  Water drinkable?  How about food?  Plants/meat edible?
I presume diseases would be an non issue since most of us have evolved our immune system based off past infections.  However, how about parasites?</p>
<p>Obligatory:
&quot;Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the Gold.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just read an interview with a paleontologist that covered this: </p>
<p>TRH: It would depend upon where and in what season you wound up. Paintings and documentaries to the contrary, there would have been times when the landscape wasn’t crawling with every species of dinosaur and other animal that inhabited that region: some may have migrated in for a time, and many would have been clumped together in herds or packs or flocks rather than randomly distributed over the landscape.</p>
<p>If you wound up in Late Cretaceous Montana, the vegetation would be something like a mix of the forests of southern Japan and of northern Australia, in a setting something like the bayous of the Gulf Coast. Until you saw something distinctly un-modern (like a pterosaur or dinosaur) you might not know you are in another time, but might think instead you were transported to some other corner of the world today. Oh, you would see turtles: lots and lots and lots of turtles.
But when you begin to notice a giant Quetzalcoatlus over head, or the herds of ceratopsians and hadrosaurids, and so forth, finding some sort of cover would be good. Depending on your nature skills, you could probably do well for a while (as well as an individual alone might get along in the most isolated parts of the Amazon rainforest or the Serengeti). Raiding nests might be a safe way of getting protein (so long as the parents aren’t nearby: since all living archosaur groups have some parental nest monitoring, we expect pterosaurs and extinct dinosaurs did the same), as well as snaring/spearing small animals, fishing (watch out for crocodiles…), and raiding kills. By the Late Cretaceous there would have been fruit, but you’d have to experiment carefully to find ones that were good for humans.</p>
<p>I would say that making your home in the trees would be the best bet. The giant pterosaurs of the time would be too big to do much perching on trees, and those dinosaurs that could get up into the trees would generally be small enough that you could fight them off. I think it would be unlikely that tyrannosaurs would try to eat too many tree-dwelling animals when there was ground-based food to go after. There would have been climbing mammals, but these too would hopefully not be too much problem.</p>
<p>(Oh, but don’t let the mammals jab you with their hind limbs! It appears that spurs, possibly poisonous, were common to many Mesozoic mammal groups, and that their presence in male platypus today is simply their last remnant.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't bet on the lack of diseases - while nothing specifically evolved to humans would be around (e.g. viruses, which tend to need pretty specific hosts), I could envision there being worms, protozoans, and other nasty little parasites that could eat your flesh, and which your body has never encountered nor developed any defenses against.  Probably bacteria that would happily rot your flesh, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
