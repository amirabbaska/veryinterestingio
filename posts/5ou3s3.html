		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remembered reading about this a while back ago and had to do some googling to find his answer but /u/jiggity_gee did a pretty good ELI5 on this. </p>
<p>Edit: This is mainly about diarrhea than regular poop.  </p>
<p>&quot;So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.
When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).
Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.
Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.
The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.
I hope this answers your question.
TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the gastrocolic reflex. Expansion and irritation of your stomach leads to the activation of your enteric nervous system, which is a network of nerves running all throughout your GI tract. This activation leads to peristalsis and movement of the colon to make space for the new &quot;to be digested&quot; food. It takes hours to make stool from your food, it never runs right through you. Certain irritable foods can make your enteric nervous system get a little testy, so that's why that Indian curry seemed to come straight out.

<p>Edit: In the hopes of sparing my inbox some grief, let me explain. The fact is there are many reasons why eating can trigger defecation and OP's question is non-specific. I still think my answer is the most common reason as OP didn't mention anything about diarrhea or corn or contaminated food. Other mechanisms are also valid and have been well covered in other responses. Also spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When food exits your stomach to enter the intestines, it's blocked by a valve called the pyloric valve to keep you from overloading your intestines with too much volume. Your body, wanting as much nutrition as possible because it doesn't know you plan on eating again, will hold as much food in your large intestine as possible for as long as possible because the longer it's in there, the more nutrients are absorbed.
So, when you eat and the pyloric valve is opened, that is a signal to your large intestine that &quot;hey! We have food again! Get rid of that old shit (pun intended.)&quot; This caused your colon to contract and poop out what, at this point, may be day or two old poop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
