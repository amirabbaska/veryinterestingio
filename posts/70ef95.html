		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SHU (Scoville Heat Units) can be determined by organoleptic (taste testing) or by means using a HPLC, </p>
<p>HPLC uses a sample that has been extracted in methanol and ran against known standards, and can be accurate to 1 shu, from 100 - &lt;1,000,000 - however it is expensive.</p>
<p>Organoleptic also uses extracted capsaicin in ethanol, then serial diluted so a technician can taste test each sample until they &quot;feel the heat&quot; in a sample. - it is cheaper but a lot less accurate but can be scaled to over 15,000,000 SHU. The technician must not smoke, have a cold, or eaten any spice for 24 hours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you could, if you did a spectrographical analysis.  However, this is an expensive and time consuming test, and the amount of capsacian varies from one pepper to the next growing in the same field, or even the same vine.  We cannot test them all, and thus answer is estimated.</p>
<p>The same is done for Alcohol, Caffeine, etc.  You could be getting very slighly more or less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's not so much that you underestimate how well we can test capsaicin, it's that you're grossly overestimating how well and objectively and accurately those other things are tested. Even caloric content is iffy - sure, you burn something and count how much energy that had, but what relationship does that actually have with how well humans can use the energy in the food? That's hugely more debatable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scoville units originally weren't, but they're completely standardized now. So, your premise is flawed. It isn't a regulated thing though, and proper testing is expensive, so it's often times a rough figure. I'd actually say that there is more variability with THC in edibles, which was one of your examples of something that is well known. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also maybe someone can weigh in on subjectivity of spice based on different densities of chemo-nociceptors or related neuron differences. There may be too wide a variation in humans to develop a standardized system</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
