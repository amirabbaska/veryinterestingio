		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the responses here are complete bs.  While RFID chips exist, they are extremely rare as the chips and the equipment to use them is expensive and unnecessary. First off, making passable fakes is difficult and takes some equipment that most people can't get, you can't just go to Wal-Mart and pick up some poker set and paint the chips.  Each value of chip is uniquely designed in terms of size, weight, color, and edge pattern.  Higher value chips are usually microprinted, have uv markings on them or holograms (Most common). Chips usually get larger in size the higher the value so you can't paint a smaller value chip to match a larger value one.</p>
<p>Lastly, most casinos use strict inventory control. When a player leaves a table with more than a predetermined amount of money, several people get a call.  If someone goes to cash out and it can't be determined where the chips came from, they don't make the change.  Leaving and going to another casino doesn't help as they will contact each other to get the information they need. </p>
<p>Lastly, casino surveillance serves as a huge deterrent to trying to steal.  It's the same reason casinos  don't get a large amount of fake bills either.  If they get a fake, it's easy to track down where it was picked up and pull a pic of the passer off the camera. Thieves aren't stupid, they aren't going to take the risk of getting caught for a single payoff. You wouldn't go rob a store without a mask in broad daylight in front of a crowd, neither would a counterfeiter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Counterfeit chips do happen, but there are some security measures in place to help prevent it. Microchips imbedded in the chips themselves, microprinted serial numbers, very precise branding and logos, and even the material composition is secret. The people who make these chips are the same companies that make checks and credit cards. All the high value chips have RFID sensors inside of them, too.</p>
<p>And even if you could make a chip that was indistinguishable from one casino's chip, trying to turn them in would be very difficult. You'd have to smuggle them into the casino and cash them out at the cashier, but any large number of chips being cashed causes security to look through the security footage to determine if you got them legally. The RFID sensor tracks which table or game they came from, so it's very easy to check the cameras.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a documentary about some people who succeeded in making counterfeit chips before RFID was in use.  The slot machines used metal tokens, the forger tried matching the size, weight, color, electrical conductivity, and all failed, until he made an alloy that rang at the same sound frequency as the real tokens.</p>
<p>Old tech, long outdated, but an interesting insight into prior methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex croupier here. I've had a couple of fakes come through, and you can feel the difference. Most casino workers have spent so much time handling chips that they can determine a stack of 20 or 40 in a few milliseconds.</p>
<p>If a chip is slightly lighter or heavier, thicker or thinner - the muscle memory for determining these chips is thrown out and you will cut them down to find the fake. </p>
<p>I was always at fairly low value tables ($5, $25 hands) so the repercussions for the fake chips was usually security coming and removing them - no idea what happened, but I imagine searched, all chips taken, and kicked out </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
