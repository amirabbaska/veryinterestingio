		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I studied Uranus' climate extensively for my PhD dissertation, so this question is right up my alley.</p>
<p>William &amp; Pollard (2003, <a href="http://physics.bd.psu.edu/faculty/williams/3DEarthClimate/ija2003.pdf" target="_blank">PDF here</a>) specifically did some really interesting work on this problem, looking at climate simulations of an Earth with an 85 degree axial tilt.</p>
<p>Something interesting happens when a planet's axial tilt is greater than 57 degrees: averaged over the year, the poles receive more energy than the equator, and thus the average temperature is quite a bit lower at the equator.</p>
<p>In their simulations, the jetstream and meridional circulation changes in unusual ways that are very different than our current climate system. As heat attempts to migrate from the summer pole to the winter pole, it gets caught up by the Coriolis force, producing one big westward jet at the equator (Fig 12 in that PDF) - similar to our trade winds, but much stronger. On the other hand, there are almost no eastward jets like in our current jetstream. </p>
<p>The end result was that ice sheets build up at the equator (Fig. 10 in the PDF), while the poles are relatively ice-free across all seasons. Sub-saharan Africa maintains a pretty steady temperature below freezing, as does the Tibetan plateau. Northern Canada and Siberia, on the other hand, reach temperatures of 100 C (212 F) in July (Fig. 9 in the PDF). Surprisingly, though, the winter pole doesn't get as cold as the equator and mid-latitudes do.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold! For folks wondering what the day-night cycle would be like, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/S48ZzNI.jpg" target="_blank">this article</a> written by some smart handsome astronomer details day-night patterns on Uranus. It would be the similar on a tilted Earth, with the notable exceptions that it would only take a year to come full cycle (and not 82 years), rotation still takes 24 hours, and average sunlight would still be as strong as it currently is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the effects is that the equator would no longer be the hottest region; whichever pole was in summer would be. This is what it's like on Pluto.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The motion of the sun in the sky would be really weird.  At each pole, there'd be one day in the year where the sun stayed directly overhead the whole time.  Then it would start spiraling outward, until it spent a day bisected by the horizon, then spiral to directly overhead the opposite pole.  At the equator, it would go from moving around the entire horizon to a normal 24-hr rise/set pattern and then back again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the northern summer, the northern hemisphere would be constantly facing the sun, with the polar region being the hottest. At the same time the southern hemisphere would be constantly facing away from the sun, and become very cold. This would slowly change until the time of the northern winter (southern summer), when those conditions would have reversed. Unlike places like the equator on our current Earth, no place would be warm for the entire year. The polar regions would be the hottest during their respective summers. </p>
<p>In addition to these temperature changes, there would be massive daylight differences between the seasons for the entire Earth. The hemisphere in summer would experience 24-hour sunlight during that season, and the opposite hemisphere would experience constant darkness during that same time. Spring and fall would be brief periods of normal daylight hours between the extremes. This is a large contrast to Earth now, as our small axial tilt means only regions far from the equator experience midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
