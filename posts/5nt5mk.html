Not everyone experiences this condition, and many times the muscles just go back to normal.  Your ligaments and joints get loose as well, all caused by certain pregnancy hormones that enable a women's hips to shift during birth.  All of this usually goes back to normal in the months after birth.  Binding your belly after birth can help your muscles come back together as well, at least anecdotally.  Your skin will almost always stay a little looser than before.  </p>
<p>FYI, there are many exercises you can do to strengthen your ab muscles after birth (wait a couple months minimum though, to heal) and these are usually not your typical &quot;ab strengthening&quot; exercises/movements.  Crunches will not help, and can often make diastasis recti worse.  A quick google search will help you find something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture your abdominal muscles running down either side of your belly button. Now see them, slowly over months, be pushed further apart. They stretch, flatten and separate, allowing your belly to grow forward. Pregnancy hormones allow a woman's muscles to soften and relax more; which is why you can do some serious damage lifting heavy things or playing sports (both things I did during my pregs). I had big babies so ended up post-preg with 6 inches of separation and had to do physio immediately after birth, while everything was still soft. Perfectly fine now, everything has snapped back into place, but I have a friend who did not do the physio who now has a permanent pot belly due to her abs being out of place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've cared for several pregnant women whom I'd put in the &quot;extremely fit&quot; category. The ones who maintain core fitness throughout pregnancy often keep their 'six packs' up to the birth. Diastasis (separation or laxity of the rectus abdominal muscles) is not inevitable. For those mamas who have cesareans, some surgeons suture the muscle layer back together and others don't, it's a personal preference. </p>
<p>Wrapping the abdomen postpartum is a very old indigenous tradition that serves the purpose of encouraging muscle healing and preventing diastasis too. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are stretched and thus can't provide the support they could before. Diastasis recti can happen, which means the rectus abdominus muscle (6 pack muscle) spreads apart, the left side pulled from the right. They can still use the abdominals they just won't be nearly as effective and are harder to strengthen. </p>

<p>When somebody says 'abdominal muscles' they are mostly referring to rectus abdominus which is the 'six pack' muscle. This muscle helps you to do sit-ups and that is all (and I guess it looks good if toned). But the real important abdominal muscles are underneath the rectus abdominus. One of the primary muscles involved in keeping your abdomen together and supporting your lower back in a muscle called transverse abdominus. This muscle together with a couple of others including the diaphragm, makes up the 'core' muscles. Transverse abdominus acts as a corset around your body so, when working optimally, it can prevent any splitting of rectus abdominus during pregnancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
