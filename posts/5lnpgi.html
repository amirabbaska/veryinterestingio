		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Global winds and ocean currents on planets are based off numerous factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tilt of the planet (not just seasons, but if influences the amount of sunlight at the equator and the poles)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positioning of continents (alters ocean currents)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positioning of continents (warm and cold air)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed of the planet rotation (Coriolis effect)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size of Planet</p>
</li>
<li>What 'substances' are being involved (we still don't know for sure what is in the Great Red Spot).</li>
</ul>
<p>If earth contained only land at the poles, and was just ocean from 60S to 60N, you would see some systematic weather. Earth (with continents) has ocean currents surround our continents and impact our climates.</p>
<p>An example: Western Europe should be Taiga (as Taiga forests usually occur around 60N and 60S). However, the Gulf Stream which hits the Eastern United States Seaboard provides warm currents to Europe; Europe, as we know, contains deciduous forest.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now about Jupiter and other planets:</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for gas giants to have bizarre weather. There is little 'atmosphere', let alone friction from the surface of the planet. We still don't know what makes the Great Red Spot 'exist'. A theory is that hot gases rise to higher levels, eddies form, and ultimately fuel the Great Red Spot.</p>
<p>Anticyclonic storms, or storms which 'spin' in the wrong direction (like Great Red Spot), are not impacted by the Coriolis effect because they are so 'small' compared to the planet's size. We know this because tornados on Earth can sometimes spin backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question! </p>
<p>Also, are there any other planets covered in ocean? I know we have yet to find liquid water on another celestial body (save for the little bit near recently discovered near the poles of Mars). </p>
<p>I do know liquid methane exists on other plants though, and moons like Europa may possibly have liquid water beneath its frozen surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're still curious, check out how long hurricanes last in aquaplanet simulations (i.e. simulations of climates with no land). I would guess they last longer because there's no land friction but I'm not sure if or how they ultimately decay in such a world.</p>
<p>Sort of related - if ocean temperatures were much higher (&gt;120Â°C), you could get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercane" target="_blank">&quot;hypercane&quot;</a>, which is a extremely large and persistent hurricane and which some propose could have existed immediately after an asteroid impact, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
