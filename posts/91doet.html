		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. However, such a system would be under incredible amounts of pressure. For example, frozen water stuck in a pipe can crack the pipe. Also, under extreme pressures, new crystalline structures form, giving rise to different types of ice. For example, Titan is theorized to have Ice VII, which only forms at 100000 atm pressures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the 1970s, a lot of people ran cars on water in the summer and anti-freeze mix in the winter.  There was some story about water being s better coolant, but mostly it was because topping up with water is cheap and easy.  This was when cars didn’t have expansion tanks do vented straight out to relieve pressure.  And if you topped up with water when there was anti-freeze in the system obviously it diluted the anti-freeze.   In passing, one reason 1970s cars with alloy blocks (Triumph Stags, Saab 99s, say) often failed early was because anti-freeze is also a corrosion inhibitor which those engines need, so people who ran them on plain water made a mess of the water passages.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I was ski-ing in Scotland in about 1980 (possibly 1980, the year Bon Scott died, I recall hearing about it on the radio in the car park at Glen Shee, certainly around then) and it was the coldest night on record: Braemar got down to -14.  In the morning, several cars in the hotel car park not only had burst radiators, but lifted heads and in one case a split block.  They had got away with it because if you move the car every day, usually the water jacket doesn’t freeze hard before you start it the following morning.   That night they didn’t get so lucky. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is commonly asked here, and as almost always answered incorrectly.  I'm assuming you talking about lowering the temperature of an extremely strong container which begins full of  water near atmospheric pressure and 0C, without changing the volume of the container.</p>
<p>The answer is that at a temperature slightly below freezing, <strong>some</strong> of the water freezes into ice.  The constrained volume will be mostly water with a small amount of ice.</p>
<p>If there are both liquid water and ice, this means we are following the water/ice I line on the phase diagram.  As the temperature decreases, the ice fraction and pressure will increase.</p>
<p>The density of the ice on the ice/water phase boundary remains below that of the starting water until the Ice III/Ice I/water triple point.  This means that the water is never all Ice I.</p>
<p>After this triple point, we abruptly change to a mix of Ice I and Ice III.  Eventually this changes to a mix of Ice I and Ice II.  What happens next is not definitely established, but is believed that we change to a mix of Ice XI at very low pressure and extremely dilute vapor.</p>
<p>The total maximum pressure is quite high, equivalent to around 21km of water column.  The vast majority of containers will simply leak at a higher temperature and a lower pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a diagram for this with temperature on the x axis and pressure on the y axis that says if you increase the pressure the freezing point lowers and at some point the freezing point will be below 0K what makes it unable to freeze? Isn't this the anomalie of water?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
