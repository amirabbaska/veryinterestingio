		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It just doesn't always take a lot of something to have an effect in your body. Cocaine and heroin have different effects on the body, but in general, they target receptors in your brain that then set off cascading reactions all over your body.</p>
<p>Lots of medications have an effect at a much lower dose than the same weight cocaine and heroin. For example, a standard dose of the benzodiazapine clonazapam is 0.25mg. It's just formed into larger pills to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>The thing is, unadulterated cocaine and heroin <em>aren't</em> super deadly in small amounts...provided you are more or less healthy and not using other substances. It's when you start mixing substances (like, cocaine and alcohol is bad news for your liver and also increases the risk of heart attack) or using while you have a health condition (it should be fairly obvious why using something like cocaine when you have a heart condition is dangerous). Body weight, how frequently you use, how you use (like snorting versus injecting)...there are lots of different variables.</p>
<p>When you get into the truly hard-hitters like fentanyl, carfentanil, and other analogues, that's when things get beyond potent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small amount of drug contains millions of millions of individual molecules of that drug. They spread out when they enter your body and bind to receptors to cause their effects. Your body uses chemical signals to communicate, so it has many receptors that are designed to detect and respond to tiny amounts of chemicals. This is why drugs work in the first place. The specific effects that an individual drug causes determine a safety index, which is the ratio between what dose has some effect and what dose will kill you. For THC, this is very high. For opioids, it's much lower, meaning that the line between fun and fucked is relatively small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is poisonous at a certain dose. Water is poisonous at high enough levels. The dose makes the poison.</p>
<p>Certain chemicals can have such disastrous impacts on the body's processes, that even small amounts are enough to disrupt major chemical or biological processes that are necessary to life. Carbon monoxide does this by preferentially binding to hemoglobin in your blood, asphyxiating your cells and preventing them from creating energy necessary for life. Botulism toxin has one of the smallest lethal doses of any chemical known to man, and several known to monkeys. It is capable of blocking your nerves from releasing chemicals needed to produce movement... Simple actions like breathing become impossible. It's all about what systems in your body these chemicals affect, and how they do so, as to what type of effect a large or small dose will have.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more: toxicology is the field of science that deals with these sorts of questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heroin blocks the neurons that tell you to breathe.  This requires rather large doses -- much larger doses than any real poison does.</p>
<p>Coke will mess up your heart by making it beat so fast that it starves.  Even smallish doses repeated can mess up the conduction system, pre-disposing you to a big heart attack 40 years later, which we think is what happened to Carrie Fisher.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are describing how the drug actually works in the system, and although this is important information, the 2 biggest reason people die from overdoses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The person was clean for awhile and then relapsed. Sometimes the person will use the last dose they used before getting clean. Their body was weaned off that big dose, so Oopsie overdose. The body’s tolerance level went down and couldn’t handle that big dose.</p>
</li>
<li>Drugs are often cut with all sorts of filler and crap. Sometimes it’s safe, sometimes it’s not. You would be surprised at the weird chemicals people cut drugs with. Anything to stretch the drug and be able to sell more. The more un-pure the drug, the more filler, the more risk for overdose.</li>
</ol>
