		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect would be temperature and oxygen availability, since hemocyanin is generally more effective than hemoglobin in cold and oxygen-starved conditions.</p>
<p>I also believe hemoglobin has greater/wider affinity for competitive inhibitors, ie. other ligands that can bind instead of oxygen. Sometimes that's desirable, other times it's undesirable (CO, cyanide, or sulfides interfering with oxygen transport). That could play a role as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Evolution probably took its course depending on what environment the different insect evolved in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I believe it is related to their ecology- dealing with hypoxia, etc. There was at least one Nature paper about it if you look.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll just paste an answer I made at another thread.</p>
<p>The authors of <a href="http://is.muni.cz/el/1431/podzim2008/Bi7630/um/The_respiratory_proteins.pdf" target="_blank">this review of research into insect respiratory proteins</a> aren't sure why, functionally, some insects have hemocyanin and some don't. For various reasons, they believe:</p>
<ol>
<li>All insects have hemoglobin genes (not always expressed)</li>
<li>Hemocyanin is ancestral in insects</li>
<li>Once a lineage loses hemocyanin, it's hard to get it back</li>
<li>Those lineages that lost hemocyanin, but then developed niches with hypoxic conditions, switched to expressing hemoglobin in higher concentrations.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't fully follow the trail of evidence for their argument, but that's what they seem to believe!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find this highly interesting. Currently 2.5 years deep into a PhD based on hemoglobin metabolites (specifically, heme. first paper is being submitted to nature this year).</p>
<p>I can't answer your question specifically but I do recall there are species of spider that have lungs vs other spiders which don't. I will say this though, Oxygen is generally viewed by the world as being this pure and wholesome thing. In reality, the appearance of oxygen killed off a huge amount of life (great oxidation event). Oxygen has a dark side, like jekyl and hyde. An alternate viewpoint sees oxygen delivery systems such as hemoglobin etc to be a way of regulating the delivery of oxygen to cells, as too much can be toxic.</p>
<p>In fact, the use of oxygen to make energy (atp) generates a lot of free radicals (basically oxygen with an extra electron) and a metabolite of heme (bilirubin/biliverdin) acts in the mitochondria to mop up these radicals.</p>
<p>In terms of your question, I think it's important to know that we share a very similar set of enzymes with bacteria and plants relating to energy generation and oxygen use, and that these enzymes are widespread and conserved  throughout the tree of life.</p>
