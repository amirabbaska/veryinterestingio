		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SometHing I can actually answer! I am on the train at the moment so references will be sparse, but most of the information will come from funder's 2001 paper.</p>
<p>Okay so there are many different ideas, approaches and factors to take into account so I will try and outline some of the main approaches and what they believe.</p>
<p>There is the behaviourist approach that believes our personality emerges from our experience and interactions with our environment.this occurs through mechanisms such as classical conditioning, which is where we learn to associate co-occuring stimuli. This can be seen with pavlovs dog experiment and watsons (1925) little albert experiment. Another mechanism is operant condition proposed by B F Skinner, this claims basically we will perform tasks we are rewarded for more often, and ones we are punished for less.</p>
<p>Another approach is the biological approach that claims that our personality is determined by chemicals, hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain. Examples of this is seratonin, which amongst other things, has been linked to happiness, and has been effectively harnessed to create effective anti-depressant medications</p>
<p>There is also the evolutionary approach that posits that we inherit our personality through genes and natural selection. Some evidence does exist for this such as Loehlin and Nicholas (1976) which displayed behavioural concordance between twins.</p>
<p>There is also the socio-cognitive approach which believes that personality comes from thought processing styles and social experience. Evidence from this can be seen in Banduras (1977) bobo doll experiment where he taught aggressive behaviour to children through them observing aggressive behaviour. Other theories in this area also include Baldwins (1999) relational schemas that claim that our behaviour is determined by our relation to those around us</p>
<p>Another, but contentious approach is Psychodynamics, which is widely known as Freud's area of psychology. This approach believes that personality is formed from developmental stages in early life, and the conflict between the ID (desires), ego (implementing reality onto desires) and superego (conscience)</p>
<p>The humanist approach also has views on personality, but provides little in the way of testable theories. This approach claims that people can only be understood through their unique experience of reality, and has therefore brought into question the validity of many cross-cultural approaches to testing personality. Studies such as hofstede (1976, 2011) have attempted to examine the effects of culture in personality, and have found significant effects, but an important thing to note is that whilst means differ, all types of personality can be found everywhere.</p>
<p>When we talk about measures of personality we often measure it with the big five measure (goldberg et al., 1980: Digman, 1989). This measure includes openness to  new experience, conscientious, agreeableness, neuroticism, and extraversion.</p>
<p>There is more to say but I cannot be too extensive currently, hope this helps. If people want more info just say and I can fill in more detail later</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://match.ctglab.nl/#/specific/plot1" target="_blank">The MaTcH study</a> is a meta-analysis of twin studies (Nature Genetics, 2015). The link is to their interactive webpage which is quite nice at allowing you to explore the 'nature vs nurture' proportion for various factors. Unsurprisingly, things like disease markers are very largely inherited. </p>
<p>The study seems to suggest a roughly 50-50 split between genetic factors and environmental factors under the subchapter measure of 'Temperament and Personality Functions'.</p>
<p>From my reading of personality psych papers over the last few years, it seems we have some reasonably consistent personality traits (like Extraversion and Neuroticism) that are likely related to inherited biological factors. However, early environment obviously plays a large role in how these biological markers are expressed in later life. For example, one could be born with a tendency to respond more strongly to negative stimuli, but those with this trait and an undesirable childhood may be much more likely to develop anxiety and depression issues overall.</p>
<p>(did a PhD partly involving personality, and have spoken to a few professors about this very subject)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some actual science, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2015-20360-001" target="_blank">here's a meta-analysis of 134 different studies</a>. Their conclusions: Roughly 40% of personality is determined by genetic factors, the remaining are environmental influence. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-25609-001/" target="_blank">Another study found that personality is mostly stable</a>, with stability increasing with age (personality becoming more constant) with genetic influences being more stable overall and more influential in early development, and environment playing a larger role later on. </p>
<p>TL;DR: You're largely born with a predisposition to a particular personality, your personality stays largely constant over the lifespan, but environmental influences become more important later on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the comments here are relatively correct in pointing out that we don't really know how personality is formed, but I think they are somewhat misleading in arguing that there are many valid schools of thought. Putting psychoanalytic theories of personality development (e.g., Freud), which have no evidence (and aren't even empirically testable in their stronger forms), on equal footing with for example what we know from behavioral genetics studies <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691615617439" target="_blank">(which have provided some of the most replicable findings in the social sciences)</a> is highly misleading.</p>
<p>While we don't really know how personality is formed, here are some things we do know. </p>
<p>First, pretty much any form of personality variation we can measure reliably shows relatively high heritability (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n7/full/ng.3285.html" target="_blank">a good rule of thumb is that most traits are around 50% heritable</a>, but of course this can vary across different traits). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ftcdu/how_is_personality_formed/dil379b/?st=j3ncy55x&amp;sh=a29fbe99" target="_blank">The MaTCH tool that u/meanspirit linked to</a> provides a decent interactive summary of what we know. What this means is that around 50% of the <em>variance</em> between people can be explained by genetic differences. This can be complex to interpret, because it is based on accounting for proportions of <em>variation</em>, such as how some people are taller or shorter than others. Importantly, this wouldn't necessarily explain human height, because no adult human is 2 millimeters tall and no adult is 50 feet tall, and so there is no variation at those ranges to be explained. </p>
<p>The next thing to know is that there probably are not &quot;genes for&quot; specific personality traits, at least not how most people think about that phrase. Instead, as Chabris, Lee, and others posit as the Fourth Law of Behavioral Genetics: &quot;A typical human behavioral trait is associated with very many genetic variants, each of which accounts for a very small percentage of the behavioral variability” <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721415580430" target="_blank">source</a>. That is to say, the variation between individuals seems most likely to be due to many genes that each make a small contribution. And, importantly, we don't really know what these genes do, and so this is all totally consistent with explanations at other levels of physiology (e.g., neurotransmitters &amp; hormones influence personality).</p>
<p>This also means that around 50% of the <em>variance</em> in personality between people is explained by environmental factors. However, we don't know a whole lot about what these environmental factors are. Behavioral genetics approaches use mathematical tools and facts about genetic inheritance (e.g., you share 50% of the difference in your genes with your mother) to partition out variation (i.e., differences between people) into 3 different bins: (1) genetic contributions (the heritability I went into above), (2) shared environment, and (3) non-shared environment. Shared environment would include all the things two siblings might share for example, such as going to the same school, having the same parents, etc. Non-shared environment is a fancy word for &quot;this is all the variance we couldn't explain with genetics or shared environment&quot;, and we don't really have a clear sense of what it is. I suspect a lot of this is fairly random, like whether you got sick one year, had a chance meeting with someone who became your friend, etc. but this is just speculation.</p>
<p>Importantly, shared environment seems to account for very little variation in personality, a point that Judith Rich Harris drove home in her book The Nurture Assumption (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/harris-nurture.html" target="_blank">summary here</a>). This means that parents don't matter for personality development very much. Harris argues that much of the environmental explanation for personality development comes from peers, but there is not a ton of evidence for this claim (although I suspect she is probably right because there are good theoretical reasons to think this would be the case, namely that children need to learn how to interact in the world of their peers if they are going to grow up to be successful adults).</p>
<p>So, while we don't know how personality forms exactly, we can say it's eventual form is probably about 50% due to genetic differences, and 50% environment, but that the environmental component is probably due to peers and random life events, and is not strongly influenced by parenting as most people assume (this of course assumes &quot;a normal range&quot; of parenting--of course this wouldn't hold for extreme abuse or other abnormalities, which are known to have a major impact on personality). This is not the most satisfying answer I know, but it is the most scientifically defensible.</p>
<p>So, what produces one variant of personality rather than another then? We can speculate based on some good theories that are starting to accumulate evidence. One explanation I find convincing is that many personality differences come from what evolutionary psychologists refer to as <a href="http://evopsychproj.blogspot.com/2011/05/obligate-vs-facultative-adaptations.html" target="_blank">&quot;facultative adaptations&quot;</a>. You can think of these as sort of like if-then rules for development, such as &quot;if you grow up in a dangerous environment, you should be less extraverted and more neurotic&quot;. These rules can be calibrated to both other genes, and the environment. Think of it this way: a single gene that might influence personality doesn't &quot;know&quot; what kind of body or environment it will land in, as it will inhabit many different bodies and environments over evolutionary time. So, one way to deal with this would be for that gene to produce facultative variation to best fit the organism and environment it happens to land in. Aaron Lukaszewski and James Roney have done some work that suggests this might be the case, as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwt3QP5AfEGwZy15ejhBSFk4Vlk/view" target="_blank">they found that more formidable and attractive people tend to be more extraverted</a>, presumably because they have more to gain and less to lose from social interactions. Similarly there is a fair amount of work around how we <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287548375_Evolution_Life_History_Theory_and_Personality" target="_blank">calibrate our bodies and minds to the environment</a> according to what evolutionary biologists refer to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory" target="_blank">life history theory</a>. Basically, we evolved to maximize our cumulative reproductive output, and this may require different strategies in different kinds of environments, such as reproducing rapidly in a dangerous environment vs. having fewer offspring but investing more in each in a safe environment.</p>
<p>This is what we know from the science. All other theories (e.g., behaviorism, psychoanalytic theories, etc.) are pure speculation, and there isn't any good evidence for them that I know of (at least not if the theories are specific enough to actually make strong testable, falsifiable predictions). Suffice to say we don't actually know that much yet, but we're learning more. And I'll just close by noting that the kind of systematic variation we see in personality variation poses a particular evolutionary puzzle or paradox. I'll put <a href="http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/jpersonality.pdf" target="_blank">this one source here on that</a>, and leave it as homework for the interested reader.</p>
<p>Tl;dr It's r/askscience, read the damn thing. </p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to add something about IQ here as well originally, but thought the response was already long enough without it. Then I remembered I actually addressed this in another post before, which can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/55hd28/how_does_intelligence_change_with_age/d8awuqu/?st=j3nif3gn&amp;sh=726d1b59" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption</a></p>
<p>She suggests that the much of the (non-genetic) influence on personality for children comes from their peer group, not from the adults in their lives.  That children look towards their peer group to decide what is normal behaviour.  The relationship with adults in their lives (parents especially) is so asymmetric in terms of power, that the adult's behaviour doesn't act as a template for how the kids themselves should act.</p>
<p>Basically, kids aren't trying to emulate successful adults... they're just trying to be successful kids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
