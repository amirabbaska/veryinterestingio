<p>I am Kim Cobb, Professor and Georgia Power Scholar in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am also Editor of Geophysical Research Letters. My life’s work is dedicated to unlocking the patterns of past climate changes from corals and cave stalagmites, with a particular focus on El Niño. With the current record-breaking event still underway, it’s been a busy year full of field expeditions to my remote research sites. Together with my students, we’ve been able to uncover the first evidence that El Niño events may be strengthening in response to anthropogenic climate change. Most recently, I participated in an interdisciplinary expedition that documented extensive coral mortality on an island in the very middle of the Pacific. I enjoy tweeting at @coralsncaves, and blogging (infrequently) at <a href="http://cobblab.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://cobblab.blogspot.com</a>. In my spare time, I’m raising four children ages 5-8. You can view my lab web-page at <a href="http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb" target="_blank">http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb</a></p>
<p>I am Anne Jefferson, recently tenured faculty in the Department of Geology at Kent State University. I am also a AAAS Public Engagement Fellow. My research answers questions like “What happens to streams when climate changes from snow to rain in the winter?” and “How can we manage stormwater to mitigate the effects of urbanization and prepare for climate change?” and “Does stream restoration work?” I’ve studied water everywhere from groundwater deep below lava flows to the mighty Mississippi River, from green rooftops to the pipe network below our streets. I am a physical hydrologist and I spend a lot of time carefully measuring how much water there is, how it’s moving, where it has come from, and how old it is. I also I collaborate with scientists who study water quality, stream ecology, landscape architecture, and human institutions. Water is a very interdisciplinary subject!
