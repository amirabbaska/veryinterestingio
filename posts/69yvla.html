		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key contribution of water in plate tectonics may seem to come from left field and be somewhat counter-intuitive, but it resides in the effect of water on the temperature at which partial melting of the mantle occurs. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GC003942/full" target="_blank">For instance, the addition of about 15 wt% water to garnet peridotites will lower partial melting temperature requirements by 350Â°C</a>. In anhydrous settings, partial melting is much harder to achieve and the plate tectonic conveyor belt &quot;seizes up&quot;, as rifting fails to give way to oceanic crust formation for lack of sufficient melt. the same problem occurs at the other end of the conveyor belt, as anhydrous lithospheric material will also require temperature a few hundred degrees higher to succefully initiate anatexis. Furthermore, the temperature increase for partial meltin of anhydrous rocks intensifies at higher pressures. (<a href="https://journals.lib.unb.ca/journalimages/GEOCAN/2006/Vol_33/No_04/geocan33_4ser01_fig8.jpg" target="_blank">See also</a>) And just to be clear, it is not sufficient for the water to occur on the surface, the mantle has to be pervasively hydrated for the presence of water to matter.</p>
<p>The case of Mars interesting, as <a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/12/1087.full" target="_blank">the martian mantle is understood to be water-poor, but chlorine-rich</a>. So, even if there was water in Martian oceans, there does not appear to have been an efficient conveyor belt reintroducing that water back to the Martian mantle. And the Martian Lithosphere is much thicker that Earths, so the corresponding anhydrous melting temperatures are rather daunting. Yet, there was incipient rifting on Mars [see Valles Marineris], it just failed to open and produce oceanic crust. There is no evidance of incipient subduction to my understanding either. There was intense hotspot volcanism as witnessed by those spectacular shield volcanoes, however, so at least some degree of partial melting occured; just not enough at sustained rates enough to open up...</p>
<p>That being said, I can't imagine how a global planetary ocean would interfere with an active plate system. Just gotta remember that over the course of geological time, plate tectonics tends to favor the progressive formation of continental crust which is much thicker and persistent, so just cause you start with a 100% oceanic crust and no emerging land in your system does not imply it will remain that way over geological time periods. In our Earths history, continental crust seems to have been much rarer and in smaller pieces in the Archean than today. </p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<p>1 - No water - no significant plate tectonic activity</p>
<p>2 - water sequestered at the surface without a way into the dry mantle: no significant plate tectonic activity</p>
<p>3 - water at the surface in small or huge quantities and a wet mantle: plate tectonics all the way</p>
<p>4 - No water at the surface, but a pervasively wet mantle: plate tectonics galore as long as the mantle remains wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I interviewed Thomas Watters about this (sort of) last year for Smithsonian Magazine. He is a scientist who studied Mercury for years and published a paper about it's tectonic activity. No oceans there, so that might answer your question.</p>

<p>And if you want to get more geeky about what Watters had to say, I also posted a blog entry with a full transcript of my conversation with him.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Mars there's no direct causation between the lack of oceans and the lack of tectonic activity. Rather they're both due to an underlying cause: Mars is no longer geologically active. Obviously this has caused Mars to cease tectonic activity; it is also the reason that Mars has no water, because no geological activity means no magnetosphere to prevent the atmosphere being blown away by solar wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I talk about this extensively in my book, Our Cosmic Story:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Cosmic-Story-Exploring-Civilization-ebook/dp/B01N6O2OBC/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Our-Cosmic-Story-Exploring-Civilization-ebook/dp/B01N6O2OBC/</a></p>
<p>From what we know of Earth, it is a resounding YES, but on other worlds it depends on how large the planet is, as hat is a key indicator of how active and hot its interior (viscosity). There appears to be a fine balance between not enough and too much interior activity. </p>
<p>Mars lost its atmosphere, water, and plate tectonics (likely in that order) because the planet is simply too small to support an active interior (and thus a magnetic field that protects the water and atmosphere from erosion), and probably had too thick of a crust as well. Venus is simply too close to the sun and succumbed to a greenhouse effect on a massive scale, losing its water through atmosphere escape. It still has an atmosphere due to it being larger than Mars and able to hold on to those gases via other methods (and an erosion process that overloaded its atmosphere with carbon dioxide).</p>
<p>Back to Earth, it has plate tectonics because of water helping to lubricate the plates and keep them moving along mainly the subduction zones. At times in Earth's history these plates were not moving (what's called a stagnant lid scenario). If there was no water on the Earth, it's quite reasonable to presume that plate tectonics would have long shut down, and our world would be a slightly cooler Venus. This will still be the case a couple of billion years from now as the Sun continues to heat up.</p>
<p>Worlds that are on the larger super-Earth size of 1.6 radius or more may not have plate tectonics either because their interiors are too active to allow the just-right anchoring of the plates and yet allow them to slide at regular intervals. This is still quite uncertain though, as these worlds may have super thin crusts, which may be enough to offset the interiors activity... though it may prove a problem with too much outgassing.</p>
<p>There is a window of where even more habitable worlds than Earth might reside with just-right plate tectonics that never form a stagnant lid scenario, or rarely, and without needing water for lubrication. These are worlds roughly 1.1 to 1.5 radius of the Earth. A thinner (but not too thin) crust is likely on these worlds as well, which helps to prevent a stagnant lid scenario. </p>
<p>The depth of the water will not have much, if any, effect on the plate tectonics being active or stagnant. Once there is water sufficient to cover the active subduction zones of the plates, driving water downward into the mantle to help lubricant the process, that is all that is required. 100 meters or 10,000 meters of water will do the same job here.</p>
<p>Water is essential to life at all stages of development, and at least as far as simulations are concerned, it seems to be nearly that case for the planet itself to maintain active geology of the type life would fine necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oceans are not necessary for tectonic activity, a fluid mantle is, though. An oceanic planet could have tectonic plate activity, though the correlation between a surface of liquid water and a fluid mantle is probably incidental.
The question of whether a fluid mantle relates with a planet core's generation of a magnetic field is an interesting one. A planet's magnetic field very probably influences its atmosphere and surface chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
