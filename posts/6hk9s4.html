<p>Of course there is nothing in principle stopping some laws (e.g. involving the speed of light or gravitational constant) from varying in time (or space) in one universe</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several multiverse theories, but in all of them I am aware of,  physical constants could vary. </p>
<p>The catch is that you can only exist to observe them in a very select subset of those variations, so from your point of view as an observing agent, the laws of physics would be constrained to those which support existance as an observer.</p>
<p>This has been proposed as the mechanism which provides a sense of constraint and continuity in an otherwise extremely diverse and  chaotic multiverse. </p>
<p>This also may be the reason that we perceive time as having a vector in the &quot;direction&quot; of entropy instead of as a &quot;static&quot; dimension such as space..... Human observation is dependent upon entropic processes like electrical and chemical processes. </p>
<p>This question might be more at home in r/askphilosophy lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the comments already written mostly get at what you are asking, but I think use some extra jargon. </p>
<p>The idea of the multiverse (not the many worlds hypothesis) is that we can only observe a patch of the universe. It is entirely possible that something like the charge of an electron, or the mass of the Higgs boson, or any other bunch of constants, varies in space. The catch is it happens so slowly that in our patch, it is either constant, or almost perfectly constant. </p>
<p>In this sense different patches define different universes, because they are too far away to contact one another they are said to be causally disconnected. </p>
<p>This all might sound a bit hokey, but the motivation (as far as I understand) is two fold. </p>
<p>First our understanding of particle physics suggests there is a Higgs field, which is vary analogous to a magnetic field. In the early universe there was a hot plasma, and this defines a temperature. In a magnet, at high temperatures the magnetic field is zero, while at some critical temperature (the Currie temperature) magnetic fields begin to appear. The Higgs field does something similar, at early times it is zero, and then it begins to aquire a finite value (finite value == particles have mass). We know in a magnet that patches of the magnet develop different magnetic fields, and so in this analogy it is reasonable to expect the Higgs to have different values in different places. </p>
<p>While that's all cool, it seems useless if we can't observe outside our patch, but this idea is important in the context of the anthropic principle. One problem with the Higgs mass is that it seems &quot;fine tuned&quot;. Traditional solutions to this problem involve supposing there is new physics that does the fine tuning for you, but as more and more searches keep not finding any of this new physics, some people have turned to the anthropic principle, which basically says &quot;Well if it wasn't fine tuned we wouldn't be alive to think about it&quot;. This seems hokey until you suppose that there are an infinite number of Higgs-patches and then the idea that one has the special value needed for life becomes rather plausible. </p>
<p>tldr; Standard multiverse assumes Higg's is different in each patch, in principle other constants could vary too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Martin Rees
Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape The Universe
ISBN-13: 978-0465036738
ISBN-10: 0465036732</p>
<p>In it he outlines the six key variables which define the physics of a universe...gravity, electromagnetic, etc  An infinite combination of these variables are possible, however only a certain few generate a tenable universe that persists long enough for life to emerge.  Most universes in the multiverse are illegitimate with unstable physics, thus blinking in and out of existence.  Our universe therefore be a &quot;valid&quot; combination, that has provided a long enough duration timespace for us to have evolved and be sitting here thinking about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
