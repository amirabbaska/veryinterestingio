		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't. What really is bad for you is being still for long periods of time. The human body was designed to be moving almost constantly. There are very few movements or positions that are actually harmful to you, but being stationary for too long strains muscles and tissues and that's what develops into painful injuries or ailments. Sitting on your butt and slouching all day makes use of some muscles but neglects other and that develops into an imbalance. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slouching tends to shift your weight off of your muscles and on to your skeleton and skin. It feels more comfortable because because you aren't doing anything active to stay sitting up. But it may ache later if your weight was on a joint, pulling your skin, cutting off circulation, or causing blood to pool in a particular area. As the physiotherapist said, this won't normally cause damage, but it can exacerbate an existing problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're relying on things in your spine that aren't intended for load-bearing and which don't repair themselves well for extended periods of time to support your weight instead of muscles, which do repair themselves but take effort to use. It's bad but feels good because you're not expending energy but it's bad because that energy would be protecting your spine</p>
<p>Edit: analogy</p>
<p>Imagine your back is held together by rubber bands. When you're upright, those rubber bands are under the least tension. When you bend over, the rubber bands are stretched and their tension keeps your back from breaking. </p>
<p>Do you think the rubber bands will wear out faster with you upright most of the time or bending over most of the time? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you use more energy when you have proper posture.</p>
<p>You relax more muscles when you slouch, so it feels more comfortable. This is why laying down feels the most comfortable; you get to relax all of your muscles completely.</p>
<p>When you sit or stand with proper posture, you are using more muscles to hold yourself in a supported position.</p>
<p>It's worth it though; good posture has your whole body work together to hold you upright. Bad posture like slouching has just one part of your body (your back) do most of the work all by itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
