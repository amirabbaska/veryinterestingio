		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best answer anybody can give is that some gene (or most likely genes) on chromosome 21 is responsible.  We don't have a specific answer to the question yet.</p>
<p>One known factor, however, that almost certainly plays a role is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452080" target="_blank">overexpression of a gene associated with collagen.</a>  Collagen plays a major role in the development of many different structures in the body such as bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage.  Needless to say, anything that affects these is going to have a drastic affect on one's appearance.  It's also likely that this is responsible for many of the other issues associated with Down's such as muscular deficiency, weak joints, and cardiovascular problems.  There are many more factors involved but to my knowledge, this seems to be the one that's most responsible for many of Down's most identifiable traits.</p>
<p>It's also worth looking at the genetics behind the disorder.  First off, there is very little variation across typical humans: roughly 99.5% of genes will be the same when comparing one person to another.  Down's syndrome, however, is the addition of an entire chromosome.  Humans have 46 chromosomes so an additional chromosome equates to roughly a 2% difference from the norm.  This means somebody with Down's is effectively 4x more different from you or me than we are from each other.  Furthermore, since 99.5% of genetic material will be the same, virtually all of the differences due to Down's syndrome that are present in one person will also be present in the next.  In short, instead of just having a few random individual variations from person to person you have a large set of common variations from a normal person to a person with Down's.  Of course, this is a gross simplification but it illustrates the principles at hand.</p>
<p>As you can see, it's really 3 different questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What mechanisms are responsible for the typical Down's morphology?
(We're not entirely sure but differences in collagen probably play a major role)</li>
<li>Why do we see a similar morphology across different cases of Down's?
(Because it's a common set of genes that are affected)</li>
<li>Why do these differences stand out more than the typical differences across normal humans even when looking at diverse populations?
(The variation associated with Down's is much larger than the typical variation from one person to another)</li>
</ol>
<p>That's the best I can do to explain it, hopefully it tells you what you wanted to know.  And of course, please correct me if I'm wrong on anything or add on if you see something important is missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facial dysmorphologies are quite common among syndromes that affect the body globally (as opposed to only affecting one organ or body part). Sometimes these are highly recognizable but often they are quite subtle - deep set eyes or thin lips or a broad nasal bridge or low ears or other things that are within the range of normal, yet are typical of the condition. Clinical geneticists have a picture book (presumably online now but a book when I saw it) of photos that guide them towards possible diagnoses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers address the ways in which the face is changed by the genetic differences of Down syndrome, but you are asking why they are all similar in appearance, not just why they are different from those with two copies of chromosome 21.</p>
<p>The fact is that people with Down syndrome have quite different-looking faces from each other, too. Search google images for the syndrome and you'll find a bunch of faces and, while they all have to a greater or lesser extent those characteristic features, they are clearly discernibly different. It doesn't erase racial differences in facial structure either - there's an Asian kid on the first page who's obviously Asian (and who obviously has Down's) for instance.</p>
<p>Probably what's going in is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_effect" target="_blank">cross-race effect</a> which is the name of the phenomenon whereby it's harder to tell the difference between faces of people whose race you're less familiar with. (Hence the well-known racist remark, &quot;black people all look the same&quot; - an offensive exaggeration of a real effect.)</p>
<p>The faces of those with Down syndrome amount to a kind of &quot;race&quot; in that they share certain typical features which are atypical in the &quot;race&quot; you're most familiar with (i.e. those of your own race who don't have Down's, most likely.) So your brain is able to use things like subtle differences in the angle of a person's eyes, the protrusion of their nose, etc., to discern most people, those parameters are so different in those with Down's that they're off the charts as far as your brain's face-recognition is concerned. That makes them seem more similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won't bore you with the specifics regarding aetiology, but essentially Down's is due to a an extra chromosome leading to significant neural and physical defects, one of which is their 'similar' appearance as you term it.</p>
<p>Those with Down's appear to have a significant degree of deficiency in midfacial area, mandibular area, and endocranial area1, perhaps due to muscular atrophy caused by the disease.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why they look similar is down to human conditioning. In simple terms, we are very adept at noticing facial differences in our own race, however often, we look at other races, black, asian etc. and cannot differentiate as well between the faces2. This is what occurs with those with Down's syndrome; we see a similar trait and assume they all 'look the same'. This is obviously not the case as those with Down's syndrome often have very different features, but we can't see past this human trait of recognising those similar to us, far better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
