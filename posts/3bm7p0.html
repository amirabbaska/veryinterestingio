Does anyone else think that seems insane? For that matter, who was the first guy to look at an artichoke and think &quot;Yep. That's going in my mouth.&quot;?</p>
<p>Edit: Holy crap! Front page for this?! Wow! Thanks for all the answers, folks! Now we just have to figure out what was going on with the guy who first dug a potato out of the ground and thought &quot;This dirt clod looks tasty!&quot;.</p></div></div>

<p>The dangerous part contains a chemical which is so fast acting that you can feel its effects on you within seconds after touching it to your tongue. So it's not that hard to figure out which part contains the poison. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But it made me wonder... Who was the first person to eat one and how did they think it would be a good thing. The amount of effort to make it edible is ridiculous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
