		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am surprised at the number of comments that focus on the alpha dog model of behavior which is pretty debunked now.</p>
<p>To answer the OP's question, dogs have a lot of non-verbal cues leading up to the actual contact. The rules one learns about approaching dogs (don't approach head-on, don't make forced sustained eye contact, etc.) apply to dog-to-dog interactions too. For example, my friend's dog charges in to meet new dogs rather than first stopping a little bit away so the dogs can observe each other, so she makes other dogs nervous this way. This is why people talk about socializing dogs, so their pets can learn social cues and get along with others.</p>
<p>Similar to how dogs that have anxiety or poor impulse control display aggressive behaviors to humans, dogs that are nervous or impulsive can appear aggressive. Dogs can also reflect the energy they get from other dogs, so one anxious dog that is snapping will make another dog anxious and aggro too.</p>
<p>Basically, a dog is communicating with another dog long before they actually make contact, so what to you is a 2 second interaction is already a five minute convo and that's enough to establish how you feel about someone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people seem to believe the pack theory of dominance,  but I believe this has been debunked and <a href="https://apdt.com/pet-owners/choosing-a-trainer/dominance/" target="_blank">isn't believed by most experts who study dogs and wolves</a>. I linked one source, but it is easy to find multiple other sources on this online. I think this is illustrated very well in the fact that the best trained dogs are not beat or hit when they do wrong (negative conditioning) but are instead rewarded when they do right (positive condition) because there isn't any need to establish &quot;dominance&quot;. </p>
<p>Dog &quot;introductions&quot; really come down to territory, protection, social skills, and personality. If a dog feels their territory is being invaded, they may show aggression. If they feel in danger or that their friend (owner) is in danger, they may show aggression. If they have poor socialization amongst other dogs, like not meeting any before, they may show aggression. A dog's personality usually comes down to experience and training. If they have been trained to be aggressive, it is more likely they will be aggressive to others. </p>
<p>I also think the &quot;little dog syndrome&quot; has a bit of truth in it. Little dogs probably feel threatened more when near a big dog while the big dog doesn't feel threatened at all. To compensate, little dogs act batshit crazy. This has been my experience with little dogs at least.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I just want to say that if two dogs are friendly, that does not mean that they are &quot;friends&quot; now and won't ever fight. This is a really bad concept to perpetuate because it leads to people who already own a dog getting a shelter dog, then not supervising them properly. I used to volunteer at a rescue and we had so many damn people adopt a dog, only to leave the new dog unsupervised with their current dog after a few hours because &quot;it seemed like they were getting along so well!&quot; but the dogs got into a fight.  We told them many times that they need to slowly acclimate the dogs, over at least a week's time, with a ton of supervision, but so many people have the &quot;awww the doggies are best friends!!&quot; idea in their head. Then they freak out and give the dog back to the shelter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite people referencing dominance theroy as an answer, please know that dominance theroy is disproven and not based on science. Dogs do NOT operate on a alpha or submissive scale. Some dogs are dog selective in who the like and body language and play style are the most important roles when a dog is deciding who they like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about body language. Dogs don't really become friends or enemies but they do establish an order when they meet. Who is the leader of the pack when they meet. Some dogs will fight to be the leader, some will roll over on their backs immediately with every dog they meet as a sign of submission. Most dogs fall between and check each dog out. </p>
<p>Two dogs that haven't figured their order out tend to cover each others pee, one will hump the other, or put their head over the neck of the other. These are all signs of establishing dominance. They'll tend to become more and more aggressive with the signs until the one they're trying to dominate submits or has had enough and they fight. </p>
<p>My husky used to be really dominant aggressive before I got him fixed. I had to learn his signs and jump in to get him to back off before a fight. He still sends dominant messages when he walks in a park but doesn't fight unless he gets bitten first. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
