	<title>ELI5: I've always heard that multivitamins aren't very beneficial because your body can't absorb all the vitamins at once and the excess is excreted. Could your body absorb more of the vitamins if you cut the multivitamin into pieces and ate it throughout the day, instead of all at once?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physician here, multivitamins have never been shown to be beneficial and have actually been shown to increase mortality in people taking them.  There's honestly no very hard evidence that you can look at to be 100% sure in explaining WHY this is, but based on what we know about the individual components in a multivitamin we can take an educated guess.</p>
<p>First off, chances are simply that you are NOT deficient in most vitamins.  Our food is specially fortified in the developed world, that's why milk has Vitamin A+D added to it, and a ridiculous number of products have Vitamin C spiked into it.  Add in the other foods you eat and most of us get most of the vitamins we need with the exception of Vitamin D, because normally a lot of this is generated via sun exposure (though there is some literature that argues that you can still be deficient despite lots of sunlight mostly in dermatology literature arguing against telling people to get more sunlight due to fears of skin cancer) and many of us don't get intense enough sunlight in the northern hemisphere due to the weather as well as the fact that we wear clothing and aren't running around naked with all our skin exposed to the sun.</p>
<p>Not being deficient in most vitamins, taking additional vitamins really doesn't actually do you any good.</p>
<p>Now as for why there is possible HARM from vitamins, well a lot of vitamins are used by your cells to grow.  And the normal amount of vitamins we eat are plenty for our cells to grow and heal normally.  The one exception is that cancer cells like to keep growing and growing, so they're the only cells that are really limited by the normal dietary supply of many of the vitamins (in particular, B vitamins and folic acid).  So now if you have a few cancerous cells in your body and you start taking tons of extra vitamins, the only cells that actually need more than the vitamins you get in a regular diet are the cancer cells, so you're basically stimulating the growth of cancers.</p>
<p>On top of this, there is some evidence that many of the components that are popular in regular multivitamins aren't that great for you.  For example, there are studies showing that folic acid in the specific form found in vitamins seems to increase cancer risk while folic acid found in vegetables actually decreases the risk of cancers-in particular breast cancer in women who drink alcohol. The EXCEPTION to this is that if you are pregnant, taking the pill version DOES reduce neural tube defects in your child so if you're pregnant or expecting to become pregnant shortly it is beneficial to take a folic acid supplement via a prenatal vitamin, it's just not beneficial to continue supplementing folic acid after you're no longer pregnant.  But eating a diet heavy in fresh folic acid (via leafy greens such as spinach) is beneficial either way.</p>
<p>Then on top of the fact that some of the components may not be beneficial or may not come in the version of the vitamin that occurs naturally, you have the fact that VITAMINS CAN INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAN IN A TEST TUBE WHEN PUT INTO YOUR BODY.  There are tons of enzymes as well as breakdown products of food in your digestive tract and in your bloodstream that interact with the vitamins to change their state and sometimes vitamins that may not have bad interactions with each other in a test tube may be changed by enzymes, or random lipids in your diet, or stomach acid, etc. into something that will interact with another vitamin to form chemicals that may not be beneficial to you.  And when you take a multivitamin you're basically taking dozens of vitamins all at once, and there's very little data about what interacts with what, you basically have to go look up research on every single pairing, and specifically research about it in the environments of the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine.  Basically we have no idea what the exact interactions are between all these vitamins in an in vivo setting when you add all the extra variable of the specific foods you're eating.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  There's no good evidence that you should take a multivitamin unless there is a specific illness your physician has asked you to take one for.  Other specific supplements may be beneficial if you are deficient (i.e. Vitamin D) and some supplements may be beneficial in only specific situations (i.e. take folic acid in prenatal vitamins if you're getting pregnant or are pregnant) but may not be helpful at other times.  There's tons of vitamins in the food you eat too, so there's only a few things that really need supplementing.  Eat your vegetables instead of a multivitamin, because eating 7+ servings of vegetables has one of the tightest associations with better long term health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always assume many of us on reddit (myself included) know very little about what's being discussed but it's never been more obvious to me than in this thread. If I could down vote the top comment more than once I would, not because I care about multivitamins but because he's presenting as shitty an argument as the people that are trying to sell you multivitamins. </p>
<p>&quot;The latest thinking is...&quot; This guys got the consensus of all scientists studying the vitamins A and C and cancer. GTFO. </p>
<p>He doesn't cite actual science but an article with a salacious headline discussing it. The article cites a &quot;vitamin e&quot; this was such a poorly designed study that one of the main researchers could not defend the findings at a GOED conference. Initially the headlines from the select study had something to do with omega-3s having some correlation to the rise in cancer. </p>
<p>I don't know why I'm all up and arms. I better see myself out.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To briefly answer your question, no. Taking bites of that multivitamin throughout the day will not make them absorb better (maybe a little more but not to a significant degree)</p>
<p>And to understand why, it may help to explain basic vitamins. </p>
<p>Vitamins A,D,E&amp;K are all fat soluble and all the other vitamins are water soluble (ie B12, folate)
So, taking excess A,D,E, or K can be toxic because they get absorbed in your fat.
Excess of the water soluble will come just make you have expensive pee. </p>
<p>The good news is you can get most of these vitamins through a healthy diet, but if you are like me and most other unhealthy Americans it may be a good idea to take a multivitamin to make sure you have enough!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is so much junk in this thread I don't know where to start.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that taking any vitamins unless you have a diagnosed disease has any benefit to you at all. I don't know why people are obsessed with stuffing more things into themselves, but there are very, very few things that make healthy people healthier. </p>
<p>There are many claims of benefit based on theoretical benefits (anti-oxidants are good because they prevent ROS from causing DNA damage and cancer!) but turn out to be completely wrong in the real world (anti-oxidants don't actually do anything to prevent cancer.) Our knowledge of physiology is extremely incomplete, and guessing about a benefit based on a single pathway is an interesting way to come up with ideas for study, but it does not actually predict the actual effect things have on your body. Any time someone points you towards some sciency sounding explanation, ask to see the clinical trial. If there's no clinical trial, what they are telling you is <em>at best</em> a half-educated shot in the dark; the more likely explanation is that they have no clue what they're talking about but really want you to buy a product. </p>
<p>The area of nutrition are dominated by salespeople selling you things that are not proven to help you live a longer, healthier, or happier life. Trust well conducted, <strong>prospective, randomized, blinded</strong> trials, otherwise it's all guesswork. Spend your money making yourself happier, not on snake oil. If you're seriously concerned about your diet, make an appointment with a dietician. If you want the short version: Eat plenty of plants and don't get fat. </p>
<p>To bring this around to your original question, multivitamins don't help you if you eat a good diet because you probably don't need more vitamins. Vitamin deficiency causes disease; there's no reason to think you need more of any of that stuff than you get from eating good food, so unless you've been diagnosed with a deficiency just stop shoving things into your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
