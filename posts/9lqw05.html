You walk into a hole in the rock and wow, you're in a cave. But when is a hole in the ground not only a hole but considered a cave by science?</p>
<p>Bonus: Are there fast growing caves that form in a for humans observable timeframe or is it always some Million years of water carving through stone? What about caves formed by earthquakes?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the answers so far. This has gotten more interesting than I expected. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no official way to define a cave. </p>
<p>“‘A natural home in the ground, large enough for human entry’ is probably the most useful definition. This covers the enormous variety of caves that do occur but eliminates the many artificial tunnels and galleries incorrectly named caves. The size criterion is arbitrary and subjective, but practical, as it eliminates narrow openings irrelevant to explorers but very significant hydrologically, that may be better referred to as proto-caves, sub-conduits or fissures. A cave may be a single, short length of accessible passage, or an extensive and complex network of tunnels as long as the hundreds of kilometers in the Flint Mammoth Cave System. Most caves are formed by dissolution in limestone but sandstone caves, lava caves, glacier caves and
tectonic caves also occur. Marginal
candidates for use of the name cave
include riverbank undercuts and rock
shelters of various origins. In some
countries a cave is regarded as being a
horizontal opening, as opposed to a
pothole, which is a vertical opening. This
usage is common in England but is not
ubiquitous[9]. 2. A natural opening
formed in the rocks below the surface of
the ground large enough for a man to
enter. It may consist of a single
connected opening or a series of small or
large chambers connected by galleries[20].</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A karst is a relatively fast growing cave in comparison to other geologic features. They form when a rock like limestone begins dissolving from groundwater. I suppose if the water was acidic enough and the flow strong enough that a human would be able to see a difference in the rock surface, but I don’t think an entire cave can form in a humans lifetime. Unless there was a underground karst that wasn’t visible by surface dwelling humans until a sinkhole formed which then opened up into an adjacent cave. I guess you can say that cave formed then, but then again not really because it would have been dissolving and eroding for tens or hundreds of thousands/million of years prior.</p>
<p>Also, I only took geology in undergrad some years ago so I may be wrong about every single thing I just said.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a stab at your bonus question.</p>
<p>Sudden rock collapses can create caves. A rockfall or rockslide from the base of a cliff could leave an overhang with space underneath. Likewise, there are sometimes caves under large boulders in talus fields, which could be deposited in a single rockslide.</p>
<p>Your more classic limestone caves form slowly through dissolution of  carbonate minerals as water flows through the formation and this is not really something that happens on a human timescale. There are other minerals that dissolve more quickly like salt or gypsum, so for example sudden flow of water through a salt formation could quickly form voids, but it's more likely these would collapse as quickly as they formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
