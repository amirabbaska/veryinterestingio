		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so...</p>
<p>Sunburn isn't like a burn from, say, grabbing a hot piece of metal--it's an ionizing radiation burn, caused by ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>Like other forms of ionizing radiation, UV radiation doesn't directly stimulate or damage pain nerves like heat does.  As one other commenter stated, it damages RNA, which later causes inflammation.  It's the inflammation that eventually causes the pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is your answer:
UV rays pierce through skin, like an ultrasound or a really really thin needle but like a lot of them.
It destroys the squiggles (rna) from making things that make your parts up (proteins) and then blood surges to the area.
If it is bad, it will form a blister or shed skin, which is the body responding to physical damage by replacing skin from beneath really really fast.
Pro tip: unlike surface burns (1st degree) or horrible through the skin muscle/bone burns (3rd degree), sunburns are 2nd degree, which means they go past the surface layer but not like, a whole lot.
Bye!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ultraviolet B (UVB) wavelength of light damages skin cells' RNA molecules, new research finds. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is part of the genetic machinery of the cell, encoding information to turn genetic instructions in DNA into proteins.</p>
<p>The RNA damaged by UVB light is of a sort that doesn't code for proteins, researchers reported online July 8 in the journal Nature Medicine. But when sun-damaged cells release this damaged non-coding micro-RNA, it provokes neighboring cells to flood the skin with inflammatory molecules, creating a chain reaction that ends with sunburn.</p>
<p>I’ll add I have no idea what most of this means, but it’d be cool if someone dumbed this down, as I think it answers your question haha. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens in a sun burn is that the radiation has causes so much damaged to your outer skin cells that it has compromised them in some way but hasn't actually killed them yet. This kind of damage is often what leads to to skin cancer (your DNA in the cells get damaged, but I digress). When your skin cells get sufficiently damaged, they essentially commit suicide to stop from turning into cancer. This process takes a long time because the little guys have to detect that they've got messed up. It's like in those movies when a comrade gets badly injured and realizes they'll end up getting their group killed, so he sacrifices himself for the group.  The skin you see peeling off is your little skin cells who sacrificed their lives to keep you alive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
