<p>In the first part of the decay a neutron is fired into a nucleus the decays and produces 2 daughter nuclei and some other emitted neutrons.
We include these in the binding energy calculations. </p>
<p>After this the two daughter nuclei decay via beta emission.  Producing emitted electrons.
We don't include these in the calculations</p>
<p>When I say calculations mean using binding energies and mass difference.</p>
<p>In both cases the particles are emitted and not part of a nucleus.
Is it because the neutrons have nuclear forces between the quarks inside them?</p>
<p>Is it because the neutrons were initially a part of the nucleus? But then what about neutrons that are fired into the nucleus?</p>
<p>Do they count as being a part of the nucleus too?</p></div></div>

<p>We <strong>do</strong> include the beta particle masses in calculating beta decay Q-values. The convention in nuclear physics to use <em>atomic</em> masses (meaning the mass of the nucleus, plus masses of all electrons, minus the very small electronic binding energy). If you work out beta decay Q-values in terms of atomic masses, you find that actually the beta particle mass cancels in the beta^(-) Q-value, because the atomic mass of the daughter includes an extra electron. In the case of beta^(+), the effect is opposite, and you find that there's actually a threshold for beta^(+) decay of 2m<em><em>e</em></em>c^(2) because not only do you have to produce a positron, but the atomic mass of the daughter is short one electron.</p>
<p>Electronic binding energies are very small on nuclear physics scales, so they're often neglected when they show up explicitly in calculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're doing nuclear binding energies, the mass of the electron and the binding energy of the electron are insignificant. An electron has a mass of about 500 keV while the binding energy is on the order of eV. Meanwhile, nuclear binding energies are on the order of MeV to 100 MeV and nucleon masses are on the order of 900 MeV.</p>
<p>Now, often the masses and binding energies may cancel out enough for the electron masses to matter, but the electron binding energy will almost never matter to these calculations. But, if your calculations use atomic masses instead of nuclear masses, then the electron mass and electron binding energy has already been taken into account.</p>
<p>Also, in the specific problem you're talking about, it seems like the beta emission is secondary to the reaction you're calculating, so you don't have to worry about it anyway. You do the calculations with the emitted neutrons and don't worry about what those neutrons do later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
