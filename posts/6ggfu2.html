I feel like I am constantly in search of something new and exciting. What is it about dogs' brains that allows them to have practically endless joy?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the replies, and a special shoutout to /u/kouhoutek -- that was a great answer!  </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans tend to anthropomorphize their pets, and attribute human like emotions to their actions.  That makes it easier to forget that they are animals and experience the world very differently than humans.  What appears to be &quot;joy&quot; could be, and often is, something very different.</p>
<p>In the case of fetch, dogs have a hunting instinct that makes they chase prey and bring it back to the pack.  Throwing a stick triggers this instinct, and their brains rewards them for following through.  This &quot;joy&quot; is similar to what a human would experience when following the instinct to drink something cold when they are hot and thirsty, and would explain both humans and dog continue to feel a sense of enjoyment even after doing it thousands of times year after year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if someone has said this already, but during the domestication process, dogs suffered a process called [neoteny] (<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/neoteny.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/neoteny.htm</a>) . This means that during the domestication of the gray wolf, individuals were selected for juvenile features, physical (larger snout, broader head, smaller teeth) and behavioral (puppy like behavior, like playing a lot, not very aggressive, etc) and the physical and behavioral traits are often connected.  </p>
<p>This basically means most modern dog breeds were selected to look and behave like a giant puppy. That's also why if you take a grey wolf or wild fox puppy and raise it to adulthood, it won't be a completely domestic animal, it will have strong instincts and often times will try to run away for mating etc. </p>
<p>This is kind of my field of study (dog genetics) so if you have more questions feel free to ask </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't an exact example of a failure of the law of diminishing returns. A better example would be throwing two balls at once. Twice as fun? How about four? A hundred?</p>
<p>The increased enjoyment per ball would decrease as the number goes up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans also have a lot more to be stressed about, which affects the brain's reward centers. Ever been on a really awesome vacation? Notice that food tastes better, music sounds better, and you're generally more interested in human activities? Dogs with good owners are perpetually on holiday.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
