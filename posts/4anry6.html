		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>when a light beam reflects off a surface, does it lose energy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. This is due to a transfer of momentum from the photon to the surface. It is not really the same as say a ball losing energy when it bounces, there are several contributing factors to why a ball loses energy and only one for light.</p>
<p>If a photon has p = E/c when it reflects it has -p (same magnitude, opposite direction). As a result there is a deficit of 2p which is transferred to the reflective surface, this increases the mirrors kinetic energy and as such must decrease the energy of the reflecting photon.</p>
<p>The fractional change in energy is very small due to the fact that the mirrors mass is much larger than the energy of the photon. I can do the math if you wish but it is roughly a factor of E/mc^2 .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, loss of energy would result in a decrease in speed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, light always travels at the same speed. The loss of energy actually amounts to a drop in frequency. Since a photon's energy and frequency are intimately related (E=h*f) then a reduction in energy means a reduction in frequency.</p>
<p>You might have heard of this as &quot;red-shift&quot; since the frequency is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum when a photon loses energy.</p>
<p>So yes photons lose energy when they hit a (stationary) mirror, this loss results in a redshift of that photon's frequency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has already been answered, but for general purpose a massless particle (photons, gluons) <strong>never</strong> loses speed. A massless particle must travel at <em>c</em> (the speed of light).</p>
<p>To answer the obvious follow-up about the speed of photons in material other than vacuum, the slowing down in speed can be explained by the photons gaining an imaginary rest mass while traveling in the medium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens most of the time when light is reflected from a surface is that some of it STICKS to the surface- is absorbed by it, more properly- and thus you get fewer photons bouncing off. </p>
<p>The best mirror I've ever seen in person was a piece of polished aluminum for a optical instrument. It was something like 96% reflective, which means 4 out of every 100 photons got absorbed. So there's no change in speed for the photons, just a reduction in the amount of them. </p>
<p>I have no idea why the rest of these folks are talking about moving mirrors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. All matter absorbs energy carried by light, like air getting hotter on a sunny day. There are likely no exceptions to this. Even mirrors absorb minute amounts of light. You can actually show this quite easily by placing one mirror in front of the other. Not only will the continuum of endless mirror reflections eventually get darker from loss of energy, but there will be a greenish tint, revealing that mirrors are slightly green.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Interesting tidbit: it's been proposed that by harnessing light energy either from a stellar source or powerful directed laser arrays we can realistically build spacecraft that can travel at relativistic speeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
