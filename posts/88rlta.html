To give an example, if two people phoned each other on speaker in the same room, the voices/sounds would echo through each other and slowly turn into an unrecognisable sound. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feedback is when a system captures its output as input, amplifies it, and outputs it again.</p>
<p>Most microphones that are designed to capture the human voice tend to favor higher frequencies, also higher frequency sounds tend to be reproduced better in computer sound systems. These differences in a normal scenario are subtle but when you create a feedback loop, any slight advantage one set of frequencies has over another will quickly become apparent as the loop cycles very very quickly.</p>
<p>So it's not that the pitch increases per se, but rather the signal gets more and more refined until only the high frequency parts of it remain. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feedback loops can be positive or negative. Negative feedback will cancel out, positive feedback will add up. This is determined by the phase relationship of the input and output signals. Due to fixed-time delays involved, the phase difference from being received at the microphone once to being received at the same microphone once again increases with frequency. With every cycle through the loop, the signal gets amplified, but only when the two are close to being in phase. Where they are 180° out of phase, they cancel out, and for other phases it is somewhere in-between. That means with every cycle, you get more resonance at particular frequencies, hence it eventually degenerating into a screech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the pitch is caused by a standing wave who's form is defined by the distance between the mic and the speaker. It gets louder because the amplification is getting compounded onto itself. So the pitch is the stable frequency between the mic and the speaker. if you move the mic closer it gets higher, you move it away it gets lower. Interestingly this setup is essentially a phase locked loop since the system self corrects the signal phase as the mic moves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that any given microphone or speaker will reproduce some given frequency most efficiently. Some common frequency between a mic and speaker will feed back first, along with some harmonics, and secondary feedback frequencies are only manifested when the primary has been EQ’ed out. At least that’s the premise I’ve been laboring under for the last 20 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tendency to increase in frequency is actually due to clipping, not the frequency response of the system.</p>
<p>When operating normally, every part of a sound system is linear in that it can only output a frequency if it is there in the input. Microphones, amplifiers and speakers can all have different frequency response curves (ie. favour a frequency over another) but they will not &quot;invent&quot; a new frequency to output.</p>
<p>When the system saturates it clips and this is a non-linear effect. Non-linear systems CAN introduce new frequencies. There are many ways to think about this, but the most intuitive for me is to consider this square wave visualisation.</p>
<p>When the clipping occurs, you take a nice signal and you cut the top of it similar to the square wave and it has the same effect as that gif: introducing harmonics (at the frequency of the system clipping). The harmonics are always at a higher frequency than the signal being clipped.</p>
<p>These harmonics are what drive the perceived pitch up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
