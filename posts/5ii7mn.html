		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This used to frustrate me when i had my house. I didn't like it but, i guess they could always claim i didn't hear them knock.... BUT Now I live in apartment complex with a 24/7 package concierge and a fulling running leasing office 9a-6p... The driver just flat out lies... It happens over and over again. I once just sat outside one morning with my doggy to see if the driver would show up... sure enough.. no show as i get the text notification that the delivery attempt failed.  How can a company do business like this and get away with practices like this with no real repercussions. </p>
<p>Update: 11:49pm - I am going to change the flair on this to economics, mostly because maybe i am realizing a bigger questions for me is, as there are less and less companies and choices out there and as we lose more and more power as consumers, whats to keep all companies from just not caring. Our power as the consumer public used to come from the &quot;i'll take my business elsewhere&quot; but more and more thats becoming difficult to do&quot; </p></div></div>

I <em>always</em> write back a complaint when the issue happens, and if I'm the shipper I ask for a refund.<br />
As for those saying &quot;don't do business with companies that use UPS&quot;, you're not wrong... But it's not easy. UPS is everywhere, and it's not always possible to know how they're shipping it. Like Amazon, I don't know <em>who</em> they're going to give it to: it could be LaserShip, UPS, FedEx, USPS, or their own private drivers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked for UPS for 10 years, so I'll take a stab at this question, but it is more complicated than you may realize.</p>
<p>First of all, you should realize technically speaking the drivers are not allowed to do that. It is against policy, and it wastes everyone's time. Yours, the driver's, and the company's. They usually have to attempt it again the next day (which increases the volume of packages on their car) so it is in their best interest to deliver it now. There are reasons why they might do that though. Not good ones, and I am not defending it. You'll see how nobody is a winner here.</p>
<p>As for how they get away with it, this is the tricky part. When they are seen doing this, which isn't always, the rule is loosely enforced - as for why, let me first explain that management at UPS, like many companies, is a top-down pyramid structure not unlike a feudal structure. Your driver's supervisor has a manager which has a boss which answers to yet another boss and so on. That top guy wants their numbers reached. Everything at UPS is about the &quot;numbers&quot; - or profit squeezed out from absolute efficiency, which typically means staffing as little as possible and getting the work done as quickly as possible so less profit is lost to payroll. This is an almost impossible task without cutting corners, and it is an unspoken rule that cutting corners is necessary to do it. This instruction from a person incredibly far removed from the realities of the job inevitably trickles down to your driver's supervisor which ends up having your driver's car loaded with an excessive number of packages because they don't want more drivers to soak up more payroll. Your driver has X amount of &quot;stops&quot; (addresses which receive one or more deliveries a day) and only Y amount of hours to do it. Because of the absolute efficiency edict delivered from a guy far removed from the situation, this means your driver has to work more quickly, which means quickly assessing whether or not somebody is home to take the package without really checking. If they can &quot;driver release&quot; (leave it on your doorstep without a signature) they will, otherwise they'll pass the problem on to the next day. If they are caught, their supervisor might lightly admonish them, but not as harshly as they would if their numbers were very poor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to some of the information already in this thread: With all of the major parcel carriers including the US Postal service, you as the purchaser of some item that is being shipped to your house are not the customer. The person who sent the package is the customer.</p>
<p>UPS, FedEx, etc. technically do not give a toss about you or when your package arrives, or if it arrives at all. The only time they will ever hear about it and care is when the shipper complains about a delivery attempt which was a blatant lie, and this happens very rarely. UPS/FedEx/USPS does not care if you take your business elsewhere -- it wasn't yours. It was the shipper, not the recipient's.</p>
<p>If you ever are in a situation where a package was left at your doorstep and stolen (or lost, or whatever) you will be stonewalled by the parcel carriers similarly. They do not want to hear from you, they want to hear from the shipper who is their true customer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
