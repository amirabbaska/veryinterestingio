		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The green is the colour of the solder mask, which is a layer on top of the yellowish fiberglass base and the copper traces. Green is a nice contrasting colour with the traditional white of the silkscreen, which makes text easy to read. Solder mask without many or any pigments added will look a little greenish because of the fiberglass beneath it, it's cheapest to not add any pigments. Other colours are used only for aesthetics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>trav1s</strong> dug into the original patent and found that they did list 3g of dye in the recipe, however they don't specify an particular dye as required.</p>
<p><strong>Tut</strong> found an article that suggests that the original combination of resin and hardener formed a unpleasant brown color, and adding yellow and blue to this formed an acceptable green color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Work at a defense company -- for production we typically use green but I've seen various colors on custom designed boards.  Also for internal projects (not allowed for sale) we use red boards to prevent any mix-ups in testing and quality sign off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The colored part you see is the &quot;soldermask&quot; and no, it usually does not matter what color it is. Sometimes you might want it to be a certain color to easily distinguish it from other boards. A company I worked at made boards with controlled impedance and we decided that green would be 100 ohms, blue was 75 ohms, etc just to make it really easy.</p>
<p>We also had some products that had two boards (a top and a bottom) so for a product like this the top board might be red and the bottom might be blue just to make it easier on the assembly line to tell a worker that red goes on top and blue goes on bottom. This made life easier for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
