		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes through natural rhythms of more being sleepy and more alert. When you are asleep, you go from deep to light to dream sleep and back again. Same for when you are awake. If you wake up during deep sleep, you will be more sleepy. </p>
<p>You can see this rhyme in lots of places. It explains the post lunch coma, even if you didn't eat a big lunch. If you try to pull an all-nighter, you'll notice some parts of the night when you get super sleepy and others when you are ok. People have different cycles leading to morning larks (morning people) and night owls (people who are more alert at night). Babies have shorter cycles which is why they nap more.</p>
<p>The cycle is somewhat regulated by daylight and involves a bunch of hormones in your body like melatonin. Artificial light like phones and TV can disrupt it which is why they advise people not to use phones or watch TV near bedtime. If you put someone in a room with no windows, they daily cycle will eventually stretch to 36 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Could be how you sleep, constricted blood flow.</p>

<p>Hard to say without knowing more about your day.</p>
<p>I'm like this too. Drag through the day and come alive as the sun sets...if I don't pass out first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel wide awake in the evening for the exact same reason that most people feel wide awake in the morning: that's the time that your body thinks it's appropriate to make you feel awake.</p>
<p>It think so because it's like a clock that's simply set to a different time than most clocks. When your friends' body clock says 12am, yours says 12pm. You can force your clock to change, with some effort. But, like a clock that's off, it'll shift over time.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm just guessing at the why, nobody could diagnose you from a sentence. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder" target="_blank">delayed sleep phase disorder</a> is well known and affects a large number of people, so it's a good bet that you're describing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was tried a lot of stuff to help optimize my rest and energy levels, a big trick is light.</p>
<p>Try to avoid looking at screens in the evening, switch to reading a book by indirect lamp light, and try to sleep somewhere where you get sunlight in the morning.</p>
<p>Your brain unconsciously reassesses what time it is based on light cues, less light in the evenings will tell your brain it's time to sleep, more light in the mornings will tell it it's time to wake up. The effect is more significant than you might think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
