		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with quantum tunneling. In quantum mechanics, the state of the particle is described by a <em>wavefunction</em>, it's not a solid ball, it's not a point, it's a continuous function defined in every point of space. The square of magnitude of wavefunction shows you what's the <em>probability density</em> of finding a particle at a given point in space. All you can do is ask a question: &quot;What's the probability of finding a particle in this volume?&quot;.</p>
<p>It turns out, that if a particle is trapped inside a pit, there's a probability of finding a particle <em>outside</em> of the pit. Like on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QzESMwy.png" target="_blank">this picture</a>. So if you come to the pit and try looking for a particle just near the walls, you might find it there! Of course, energy conservation rule applies, so you can't <em>create</em> energy from quantum tunneling, you can just find the system in a state that's inaccessible if you think about the system in a classical way. So quantum tunneling allows particles to &quot;apparently&quot; skip energy barriers.</p>
<p>Now, how does this help thermonuclear fusion? I'm going to explain a single step of fusion that happens on the Sun: fusion of two Hydrogen(^(1)H) nuclei into Diproton(^(2)He) and light (gamma photon).</p>
<p>Nuclei are held together with so-called <em>strong force</em>.  The strength of the <em>strong force</em> falls off faster than <em>electromagnetic force</em>, so it's weaker on long distances, but it's <strong>much</strong> stronger on very short distances.  In order for two Hydrogen nuclei (or protons) to interact <em>strongly</em>, they need to get close enough for <em>strong force</em> to overcome <em>electromagnetic force</em> that pushes them apart. Once two protons get close enough for strong force to overcome electromagnetic force, they may form a Diproton(^(2)He) and emit light. If you plot the potential energy (think in terms of height of the hill) of two protons as the function of distance between them it will look <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TUFrtuj.png" target="_blank">something like this</a>. So, in order to get the proton &quot;over the hill&quot;, it has to have more than &quot;critical energy&quot;. </p>
<p>Here's how quantum tunneling comes into play: even if the proton has <em>less</em> energy than &quot;critical energy&quot;, you can still &quot;find&quot; the proton behind the hill of potential energy! <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DY7peOW.png" target="_blank">Like this</a></p>
<p>Where does this &quot;energy&quot; come from? It's <em>kinetic energy</em> (or movement) of nuclei, which is directly related to the <em>temperature</em> of Hydrogen. So, quantum tunneling allows Hydrogen-Hydrogen (or proton-proton) reaction to happen at <em>lower temperatures</em>. Of course, these temperatures are still <strong>extreme</strong> by our everyday standards (millions of degrees).</p>
<p>Please note, I'm simplifying every step quite a lot, and there's a lot of <em>very</em> complex math everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though it is really really hot, the electrostatic potential that needs to be overcome is enormous. That is, because two protons coming together are both positively charged, they will feel a repulsive force until they get very close to each other (of order a proton diameter in distance), at which point the strong force will take over and then hold the two protons together. However, it turns out that even with such a high temperature/high kinetic energy/high speed, overcoming that barrier is really difficult. Instead, the dominant way they can get through the barrier is to tunnel. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/imgnuc/alpdec.gif" target="_blank">This picture</a> discusses the decay of a helium nucleus but the idea is the same (in reverse, the energy scale is slightly different). There is some probability for a proton to make it across the barrier and into the potential well on the left-hand side (small separations), at which point getting out becomes really difficult because you're stuck in the well.</p>
<p>EDIT: Correction thanks to /u/Greebo24 on the strong force distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>Quantum tunneling predicts that two ^(1)H (protons) can form an unstable <em>diproton</em> atom. Classical mechanics would not allow them to cross the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_barrier" target="_blank">Coulomb barrier</a> even at solar core temperatures</li>
<li>That <em>diproton</em> atom can, with <em>very</em> low probability (once in 10^9 years), <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission" target="_blank">beta-plus  decay</a> into stable deuterium.<br />
Normally <em>diproton</em> disassociates right back into two ^(1)H (protons)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia's <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction#History_of_the_theory" target="_blank">Proton-Proton chain reaction</a> has the details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The theory that proton–proton reactions are the basic principle by which the Sun and other stars burn was advocated by Arthur Eddington in the <strong>1920s. At the time, the temperature of the Sun was considered too low to overcome the Coulomb barrier.</strong> After the development of <strong>quantum mechanics, it was discovered that tunneling of the wavefunctions of the protons through the repulsive barrier allows for fusion at a lower temperature</strong> than the classical prediction.</p>
<p>Even so, it was unclear how proton–proton fusion might proceed, because the most obvious product, helium-2 (diproton), is unstable and immediately dissociates back into two protons. In 1939, Hans Bethe proposed that one of the protons could <strong>beta decay into a neutron via the weak interaction during the brief moment of fusion,</strong> making deuterium the initial product in the chain. This idea was part of the body of work in stellar nucleosynthesis for which Bethe won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This first step [, fusion of two ^(1)H nuclei (protons) into deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino as one proton changes into a neutron,] is extremely slow because the beta-plus decay of the diproton to deuterium has a negative Q value and so is extremely rare (the vast majority of the time, the diproton decays back into hydrogen-1 through proton emission). <strong>The half-life of a proton in the core of the Sun before it is involved in a successful p-p fusion is estimated to be a billion years, even at the extreme pressure and temperatures found there.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protons need to get really close in order for the attractive atomic force to exceed the repelling electric force. This can be regarded a barrier which demands extreme pressure and/or temperature to overcome. Quantum tunneling allows protons to 'jump' the last small distance of the barrier, reducing the required pressure and/or temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
