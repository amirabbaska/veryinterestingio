		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be a mix of all of the above.</p>
<p>The immune system is split into the innate and active/adaptive systems.  The innate are, to use a video game analogy, all the non-specific &quot;passive&quot; defenses of the body.  For example, inflammation, skin, and enzymes designed to digest viral-specific dsRNA are all innate portions of the immune system.  Like passive systems in video games, the innate system is designed to slow down pathogens until the active system comes into play.</p>
<p>The active system is the hunter-killer of the immune system.  Immune cells are basically split into 3 important types: killer T cells, helper T cells, and B cells.  Killer T cells recognize cells that are infected with viruses and destroy them.  Helper T cells bind to &quot;trash collector&quot; cells that go aroud digesting cellular debris.  B cells are recruited by helper T cells to produce antibodies that bind to the recognized pathogens and act as &quot;kill me now&quot; flags.</p>
<p>The one flaw of the active system is that since each killer and helper T cells are specific to only one pathogen, it can take a very long time for a specific T cell to be able to detect and recognize the pathogen and create an immune response.</p>
<p>People with stronger immune systems may have more immune cells, systems able to better move immune cells around, or may be just lucky (since the protein on T cells that recognize pathogens is randomly generated).</p>
<p>This is a ridiculouslu simplified version.  There are dozens of other nuances and steps in the immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here are giving vague overviews because immunology is complicated, so I'll just add a concrete example of something that is measurable that can result in better or worse immunity. And this is the MHC repertoire that you have, which is genetically encoded. MHCs are the molecules that present fragments of proteins (for example, from viruses infecting your cells) from cells in your body to immune cells for recognition. These vary widely from human to human, and you can have up to 6 different types for MHC class I, for example. Having a more diverse set of MHC molecules allows for presentation of a wider range of peptide fragments and therefore better immunity. This has been studied fairly extensively and is termed the &quot;MHC heterozygote advantage.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, this answer is stupid complex, and can go on for days. There are whole semesters devoted to the understanding of the human immune system, and disciplines in how it works, and those disciplines have sub specialties. This is a deep deep DEEP rabbit hole one can fall down, but also awesomely fascinating. My background. A year of microbiology and bacteriology, and a year of anatomy and physiology, and I am a nursing student.  My understanding of it scratches the surface, but I hope it can help answer your question. To quote Carl Sagan, &quot; If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.&quot; </p>
<p>The name of the game in immunology is for the body to fight off infection before it gets out of control. The bad stuff out there is bad because of many different reasons, bad stuff like HIV, Ebola, Plague, TB, Smallpox, C.Diff just to name a few all kill us, some fast, some slow, and are difficult to treat, or cure, or prevent, for more reasons than I can even tell you.</p>
<p>On the basic level, we have two main branches of our immune system: Innate and Adaptive. Calling them branches is doing a disservice, it's more like the top of a cascade web. Part of the team is the innate, the other part is the adaptive, and they work together for the bad stuff. </p>
<p>The innate, or basic immune system is just that, not descriptive, and works right away when exposed. This system is HUGE! So many parts to it, I will try and touch on a few. </p>
<p>We'll use dendritic cells, they are commonly found in your skin layers deeper than the outer layer of skin, the water repelling one. When they see a pathogen, they will commonly take it up, put it into a sac, and put lysing agents into it to break down the cell, these can be many things, but it's not important what they are, just that they break down the cell. These cells are special, they have a part called an &quot;Antigen Presenting Complex&quot;, or APC (Sometimes APC is also used for antigen presenting cell, but its essentially the same thing). The APC is important, because it is a special Major histocompatibility complex or MHC. Every cell in your entire body has a MHC class 1 cell, or MHC-1 (except for red blood cells, its why RBC can be infused easily, but a kidney cant just be tossed in anyone without compatibility). Those special cells with the APC have MHC-2. You can think of MHC as flag holders. MHC hold your own cells. Your identifier. MHC-2 is like holding a flag and saying &quot;These guys are invaders, let's kill them!&quot;</p>
<p>Ok, so we have the difference between, MHC 1 and 2. This is very important. With your innate immune systems, it sees bacteria easily as foreign invaders and can easily keep up with a lot of infections, and eats them as they go. Your main eating cell, a neutrophil eats everything as they go, but do not have an APC. They are also the main makeup of pus for instance. </p>
<p>Well let's say the infection is a bit faster than the innate immune system in its killing. So that same dendritic cell, still working like it does, takes a part of the bacteria it just took in, and puts its in its MHC 2 spot. It then ventures to the lymphatic vessels, looking for help. Now the MHC-2 is very specific. When you are young, your immune system is still building, making a ton of different cells, with slight variabilities. Flags was a bit too generous they are more like keys. So your dendritic cell in essence is taking its key and trying to unlock every lock it sees, until eureka, it finds one. This lock is typically a helper T cell. The helper T cell is activated by a chemical signaling released when it pairs with that APC, no pairing, no chemical signaling. </p>
<p>Once activated the helper T cells whip into action. They start coding cytotoxic or &quot;killer&quot; T cells for their activated antigen. (For this I will write them as Tc-cells, and helper T cells as Th-cells). So with Tc-Cells being activated, Th-Cells also start dividing and activating B-Cells. </p>
<p>B-Cells turn into plasma cells and start releasing different antibodies to help the innate immune system do its job. On the basic level your adaptive immune system is activated. This system is not fast though, at all. On first exposure to a new pathogen it can take on average 10-14 days to activate. On secondary exposures it can activate faster because while those Th-Cells divide to make new Th-Cells to activate more stuff, they also make T-memory cells. Essentially putting more locks out there to be unlocked by a key, and takes anywhere from 12-72 hours to hit its peak. </p>
<p>So what does this adaptive immune system do? Well to understand that fully, you need to understand a few things first about MHC 1. Ok so like I said, nearly every cell in your body has MHC 1. What is it? Its like a flag, but a barcode. That barcode is essentially a piece of your DNA, that says &quot;I am self, do not kill&quot; when read. If the cell is infected with a virus, it instead puts a piece of this virus in that MHC 1 complex, and when it is read, is flagged to be killed. You can feel this happening for instance, when you have a sore throat from the flu, its the cell death. </p>
<p>Ok, so what next? So I kinda scratched the surface of innate immunity. There are lots of ways this is done, but on a basic basic basic level, innate immune system destroys invading pathogens by either eating them or causing them by way of something called the &quot;Complement system&quot; that involves many proteins that bind together and punch holes in the cell and destroy it. Plasma cells assist in this, a lot, making the innate systems job easier. Plasma cells are like mortar fire in war, they don't directly kill things, but release antibodies known as immunoglobulins, there are many kinds, but they break down to major types. IgG, IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgD. Each plasma cell releases antibodies specific to its coding for that pathogen. For the most part, they are Y shaped, or combinations of Y shapes. They two top tips of Y are specific binding, the single tale usually is not. So what do these antibodies do? Well a lot of things. They congregate pathogens so phagocytic cells can take a &quot;bigger bite&quot; IE work efficiently. Those non specific also are markers to make it easier for phagocytic cells to &quot;see&quot;. They also can activate the complement pathway. </p>
<hr />
<p>OKAY! So we have set the universe up on a basic basic basic level. So maybe I can kind of answer your question. Based on what you have said, all those are theories, and possibilities. Genetic diversity is wildly large. We can look to other creatures for some insite. Alligators for instance have amazingly strong innate immune systems. Think about it, they live in a swamp filled with all kinds of pathogens, and haven't died out from their own plague, getting scrapes, cuts, and all kinds of things that compromise their barriers. They also have other parts of their innate immune system that makes it work better. Penicillin is from a fungus that produces a beta-lactam ring that comprises bacterial cell wall synthesis. Descendants of black plague survivors have an immunity to HIV, because of a mutation where HIV binds to. Sickle cell disease offers resistance to malaria, if you know anyone with it, when they get sick they can have a sickle cell crisis from it. Ebola is so dangerous because it spreads fast because it suppresses part of our immune system in synthesis, its not ebola that kills you, its your immune system trying to keep up that kills you. Hepatitis B, your immune system is responsible for the liver damage. Autoimmune diseases can come after an infection that had a pathogen present similar to some of your cells. Newborns don't have many of the specific immunities form the T cell pathway, due to not having an immune system, and thus get their antibodies from a mother's breast milk, who was likely exposed to the pathogen as well and is fighting it off unnoticed. </p>
<p>Good lord that got long, and I hoped I answered your question somewhat. It is wildly complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's true that people have different efficiencies in their immune systems, but when people talk about this stuff, it probably more accurately reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the immune system works. When I hear this kind of thing, what I hear are comments like &quot;I got sick 6 times this year, therefore I must have a weak immune system.&quot;</p>
<p>In reality, this person got sick 6 times because they were EXPOSED 6 times to 6 different strains of a virus. Their immune system works just fine so they recovered normally each time. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think that laypeople expect their immune system to destroy every virus they are exposed to before it causes symptoms, but that's just not how it works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an example of a &quot;bad&quot; immune system that I have personal experience with.  </p>
<p>My wife unfortunately has Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID).  She is deficiency in all three major types of immumoglobulins: immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) while others have a shortage of just IgG and IgA. The diagnosis is made by finding that functional antibodies are very low or absent.</p>
<p>Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID) is a type of primary immunodeficiency, which is defined as an immune system dysfunction typically caused by a mutation in a gene or genes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes more than 180 primary immunodeficiencies ranging from relatively common to quite rare.</p>
<p>CVID is one of the most prevalent of the symptomatic primary immunodeficiencies and manifests a wide variability of symptoms and range of severity. It is considered a diverse group of diseases of unknown cause (etiology) as many different immune system defects have been found to lead this syndrome. CVID is characterized by a low level of specific proteins (antibodies, also called immunoglobulins) in the fluid portion of the blood which results in a decreased ability to fight invading microorganisms, toxins, or other foreign substances. These immunoglobulins are produced by specialized white blood cells (B cells) as they mature into plasma cells.</p>
<p>The cause of CVID is unknown in at least 90% of cases, and a genetic cause has been identified in less than 10%. Sporadic cases, with no apparent history of the disorder in their family is the commonest form and may be caused by a complex interaction of environmental and genetic components (multifactorial inheritance), but genes that are involved in the development and function of B cells are believed to be the primary cause.</p>
<p>Due to my wife's inability to make he own anti-bodies she has to be infused monthly with all three major types of immumoglobulins: immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM).  </p>
