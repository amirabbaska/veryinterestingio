<p>It's their job, in a way. What that guy recently did is completely in line with how America currently regulates and prioritizes its healthcare industry, so it is as simple as &quot;The CEO had an opportunity to lawfully make more money, and he chose to do so.&quot; If it causes enough legitimate outrage from society, we are free to change the rules in order to make our moral outrage into regulation... otherwise, the CEO is doing what we, as a society, have said, &quot;Sure, that's okay!&quot;</p>

<p>There are various ways to gain a monopoly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret" target="_blank">Trade Secrets</a> provide a potentially unlimited monopoly (so long as no one lawfully figures out the secret) on a technology/product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patents provide a government-granted monopoly for about a decade (depending on the item/product) in exchange for the inventor sharing how to create the product, which then becomes public property when the patent expires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly" target="_blank">Natural Monopolies</a> occur when, for various reasons, the market favors a single source of production/offering of a product and, as a result, it isn't worth it to competitors to try to overcome the barriers of entry to the market to compete.</p>
</li>
<li>Supply Chain dominance can also lead to a monopoly. A good example of this is <a href="http://www.insightsquared.com/2012/03/great-moments-in-business-intelligence-liquid-soap/" target="_blank">liquid soap</a>. In short, the creator of liquid soap in dispensers realized there was no way to prevent competitors from copying its new product (which it, rightfully, recognized to be extremely valuable). So to guard against competitors, before going live with the product, the company bought up the world's supply of plastic pump dispensers. Then, when the company brought liquid soap to market and sales went through the roof, competitors were prevented from competing simply because there were no plastic pump dispensers for purchase, which required competitors to either (a) spend the money to create their own factories/supply lines for plastic pump dispensers or, (b) buy out the company. They opted for the latter.</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue falls somewhat in the &quot;natural monopoly&quot; world combined with &quot;supply chain dominance.&quot;</p>
<p>Here, the market had essentially allowed a single company to create this drug for a while and, for whatever reasons, the price of the drug reached a reasonable price that the market was cool with and no competitor could see value in competing with. Then that drug was purchased by another company who raised the price considerably. </p>
<p>This would, as you pointed out, generally create an incentive for competitors -- except the new company controls the supply line to create the drug, which makes any possible competition face a lot of costly barriers (creation of new supply lines, in addition to the usual expenses of clearing a drug with the FDA).</p>
<p>Because of those barriers, the company has no reason to reduce the cost of its drug (legally, at least). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generic companies only have an advantage if the brand name drug is expensive and has a big number of users. Then they can swoop in at a lower price and take away some of those users.</p>
<p>The drugs currently in the news are already cheap and have a small number of users. The conditions they treat are rare. Therefore, no company has wanted to compete with them. </p>
<p>A company might be interested now that the price is $700+, but they have to invest time and money into building production lines and gaining FDA approval. And it's not like they can come in at $500 - they already know the brand name company can sell for $10 if it wanted to.</p>
<p>So they have to decide if it's worth making a generic that isn't very profitable.  </p>

ETA: Some specifics on Daraprim, based on questions below: According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-21/clinton-s-tweet-on-high-drug-prices-sends-biotech-stocks-down" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Daraprim has only about 2000 American users. It cost about $1 most of its life, rose to $13.50 in 2010, and recently jumped to $750. That <em>big</em> jump is what's causing the recent interest. The CEO says he'll use the additional profit to invest in more effective treatment research. Daraprim also uses a <a href="http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/monica-v-golik-mahoney-pharmd-bcps-aq-id/2015/07/new-pyrimethamine-dispensing-program-what-pharmacists-should-know" target="_blank">strict</a> distribution, making it hard for competing companies to get samples of it and complete FDA approval.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're referring to the current news. The reason is because it's an orphaned drug. Companies cannot produce a generic without filing an ANDA to show bioequivalence. This is very expensive and is a financial loss to generics companies (who require a large market of users, of which this drug is not).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government is actually the cause of a lot of generic drugs prices sky rocketing.  Many drugs that have been used for decades were never approved by the FDA, they were just &quot;grandfathered in&quot;.  Having been used for so long, they are already known to be safe and effective.  As a bonus, they are usually also very inexpensive.  Well, the FDA under Obama has decided to force these legacy drugs to go thru the FDA approval process.  The result is a drug that was previously safe, effective, and cheap suddenly becomes ruinessly expensive.  Pilocarpine, for instance, used to be $4 a bottle.  Now it's $200 a bottle.  Phenylephrine has also gone from $8 a bottle to $180 a bottle.</p>
<p>This is a great deal for the drug companies.  Usually, putting a drug thru the FDA approval process is pretty risky.  But now they have a whole catalog of drugs that they already know are safe and effective.  They can get these drugs approved by the FDA and then be granted the exclusive right to produce them and then jack the price up 1000%!  All this without having to spend a penny on R&amp;D!</p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason to make drugs already known to be safe and effective get an FDA approval.  It screws consumers, increases healthcare costs, and adds nothing to the body of scientific knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine worked for a generic pharma company that started developing genereic drugs for various conditions for felines and canines.  </p>
<p>At first the company had success selling the cheaper drugs to veteriarians and then they started to approach large distribution companies.</p>
<p>When the large distribution companies tried to buy the generic drugs, the brand drug companies came back and said if you buy these two or three generic drugs, then we'll cancel our contracts with you for all the other drugs you sell from our brand.</p>
<p>In the end, the veterinarians and distribution companies wanted to buy the cheaper generic brand drugs, but because the generic companies could not offer the huge lot of drugs the larger brand name drug companies could, the veterinarians and distributors had to refuse the sale...and had to remain with the brand name drug providers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
