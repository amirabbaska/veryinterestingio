		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That question is kinda hard to answer, hereâ€™s my attempt as a plant ecologist. Grasslands today exist where grasses can outcompete pretty much everything else, or that are too inhospitable for other vascular plants. Without competition from grasses, shrublands and woodlands would likely have been able to establish in many of these places, other places that were too harsh likely would have been barren except for a covering of moss, lichen, or cryptogamic crust. Marshes, wetlands, meadows etc that are dominated by grasses and grasslike plants either would have instead been dominated by mosses, ferns, and horsetails or trees and shrubs that can tolerate wet feet, or just open water, maybe with aquatic plants/green algae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae" target="_blank">Grasses evolved about 60-120 million years ago</a> and this estimate is under constant revision in the face of new fossil evidence.</p>
<p>But many plants which could casually be called &quot;grass&quot; are not actually grass, yet occupy many of the same ecological niches.</p>
<p>Sedges, for example. I could not quickly find a source of estimates on the earliest sedges, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poales" target="_blank">the phylogenetic tree in this wikipedia article</a> suggests that sedges (Cyperaceae) are more basal than grasses (Poaceae). So I would imagine them to have been around earlier. Emphasis on the word &quot;suggesting&quot;.</p>
<p>A solid answer may not be available due to lack of good fossil evidence. Even though there are fossils of both families, and these can be dated, how do you know if you have found the oldest fossils of both? You can only start to be confident after a great deal of effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the best suited to give an in-depth explanation, but I would note that angiosperms as a whole are relatively recent in the evolutionary timeline of plants, which have been around for about 480 million years.</p>
<p>The first flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms about 200-250 mya, and angiosperms became widespread about 120 mya (so about the last quarter of the entire existence of the plant kingdom).</p>
<p>Poaceae (the family that contains grasses) was originally thought to be around 55 million years old, but older fossil evidence keeps turning up. Plant structures associated with grasses have been found in fossilized dinosuar feces dating back to 66 mya, and revised dating of the rice tribe and fossil evidence of mammals with apparent grass-feeding adaptations have pushed the origins of Poaceae back to around 100-120 mya, about the same time that flowering plants became widespread.</p>
<p>As far as the make-up and distribution of plant communities prior to the emergence of grasses/grasslands/angiosperms in general I really don't know. Nor do I know much about erosion and soil formation at the time plants first began to colonize land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll give my two cents with the two examples I know, the African savanna and the Australian outback, they have similar stories. </p>
<p>The savanna/outback used to be home to jungle/rainforest. The thing about rainforest is that it is a self-perpetuating cycle. There is a huge amount of evaporation, called transpiration, that comes from the leaves of the plants in a rainforest, this causes a lot of water vapour to form above the rainforest, which makes it rain, which feeds the plants which move the water to the leaves which transpirates. </p>
<p>Most of the African and Australian continent used to be rainforest but became grassland over thousands of years due to 2 factors. The first is mechanical destruction. The african rainforest was destroyed by elephants. Less rainforest means less rain which means the rainforest will not grow back. Grass grew back after being trampled because it didn't rely on such delicate conditions. Then the grass caught fire. Natural grass fires burn grasslands down to stubs, but grasses have evolved for this to be as painless as possible and grow back quickly. They also burn all the trees that were competing with the grass. Evolution can be really smart sometimes. So you get savanna. In Australia the source was a bit different. Natural fires helped but what was possibly the biggest source of rainforest loss was the indigenous people burning the forests to hunt animals. Nowadays there are some trees that must be burned to reproduce.</p>
<p>Tl:dr: Thick rainforest and jungle, at least in Africa and Australia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that ferns likely occupied the niches that grasses do in modern times. Grazing dinosaurs ate ferns which were harder to digest than grasses are for modern grazers. Not sure what hypothetical consequences came from that.
