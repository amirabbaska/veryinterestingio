		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a multi-part question, I suppose. First time posting here and asking you guys about something. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever it is that spiders are grown and ready to set up shop, spin a web and wait for dinner (the species that do hunt this way), how does it choose the location? How does it know where the ideal place is to collect food?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How far do they travel to seek out such a place, if they do &quot;seek&quot; out certain places. Do they just drop a web whenever and wherever they are hungry? Move on when they get bored to a new place?</p>
</li>
<li>Going through some things in the bottom of the closet, stuff that gets moved on occasion, a couple times a month maybe. Inside a shoebox (and similar places) there are usually some tiny, tiny spiders with their homes set up. Is there really a steady food supply in there, tucked away, door shut? Obviously I know there is tiny food for them galore, but really, in my closet?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an almost impossible question to answer due to the vast amount of species of spiders; some spiders spin traps on the ground to alert it and catch the prey: trapdoor spider; Other tall grass faring spiders turn their webs towards the wind hoping for insects to get blown in; Some spiders build their webs over the water to eat insects flying up after they are hatched or down to drink water; Some even make webs underwater so they can trap bubbles down with them and live off plants re-oxygenating it and small fish and underwater insects. Basically, where they think there is food.</p>
<p>Traveling, some spiders travel by flying with web when they are born like a dandelion keeping them in the mile to two mile range and will generally only travel in a half mile zone from there, most web spinning spiders don't even move a half mile from their landing point though; hunting spiders are the only group that tend towards a bit of traveling but still abide in their territory.</p>
<p>If those spiders are cellar spiders they can go a long time without eating over 6 months, so a little food is enough to sustain them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a tough question to answer because spiders &amp; tarantulas and arachnids in general are so diverse in hunting and web building.</p>
<p>I probably am wrong here but in developed cities i'm sure it's to do with dust. Spiders are such apex hunters and dust generally attracts insects <del>and harbors dust mites which would be an ideal food source</del> in developed cities. plus dust leads to dirt which brings in more insects for spiders to hunt. and it can help them blend into the environment. Female spiders depending on the species generally build webs where as the males will scout and hunt. Depending on species though they all harbor different hunting techniques.</p>
<p>A species of spiders in Brazil work in communes to build massive webs together to maximize the catch of prey. Most other species are single serving free-for-all loners. Some tarantulas can burrow webs under water. Some build funnel traps in dirt and sand and other tarantulas can and will fight and eat snakes and birds and similar sized foes. I guess it depends on species and location. I notice most house hold spiders build webs in dusty corners and every nook 'n cranny. Garden spiders build big webs between plants because they can be brightly colored and if they sit in the center they blend in with the plants to another insect.</p>
<p>I'm recalling this knowledge from all the spidey books I read as a kid when I had a huge fascination with Arachnids. I am most likely wrong and would like a real spider master to correct me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Q:  ceiling spider in my bathtub; stays in 'open side' of the bathtub curtain.  If we move the curtain to the right, the spider will migrate to the left.  If we change curtain sides, spider does so again.  We can repeat this on demand - as if a critical role of his existence is to stay out in the open.  Why is he doing this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
