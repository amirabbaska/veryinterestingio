		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no law against monopolies. There are laws against <em>abusing</em> a monopoly position.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to compete with your business model <em>because you are the best</em>, that is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to compete with your business model <em>because you actively try to penalize and hinder your competitors</em>, that is illegal.</p>
<p>For example, the infamous EU case against Microsoft over bundling Internet Explorer with Windows  was not because they had a monopoly on the OS market.</p>
<p>It was because the used their monopoly on the OS market to push an unrelated product, giving that product an unfair advantage: the created a situation in which people used Internet Explorer not because it was the best browser, but because, they were Windows users, and so IE as practically forced on them.</p>
<p>The case against Intel was not because Intel dominated the CPU market. It was because they used their dominance to actively keep out competitors like AMD: they created contracts with customers saying things like &quot;we'll give you a discount, as long as you don't buy <em>any</em> AMD products at all*&quot;. For customers who might normally buy 90% Intel anyway, that's a tempting offer. Just switch the last 10% of your purchases over to Intel as well, and you get a fat discount. In other words, they used their monopoly position to create an artificial barrier for AMD. That is illegal.</p>
<p>But simply having a monopoly because you make the best product at the lowest price is not illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being in an uncompetitive field is not a monopoly per se.
Owning all of the competition is. There was a recent one involving BAA and its ownership of gatwick, stanstead and heathrow airports.  (This of you who don't know - those are the 3 largest airports serving London). They were forced to sell gatwick and Stansted so that they couldn't control the market and Jack up prices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the USA, certain businesses are allowed to be monopolies at times.  AT&amp;T used to be but is not now.  Formerly, trucking companies had exclusive rights to certain long distance routes. When technology changes, frequently that is when a monopoly business loses its market power. Often monopolies have their prices controlled by government agencies. ..... example, electricity providers.  When something altogether new comes along, say Google Search or Microsoft Windows (back in the day), the company grows to be effectively a monopoly.  At some point, customers will complain about anti-competitive behavior from the monopoly company.                                                                    The US Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission will investigate. The Justice Department successfully argued before a judge that Microsoft was using &quot;anti-competitive practices&quot; by forcing PC manufacturers to bundle their browser software with their operating system. As a result, Microsoft was forced to uncouple the two products.  Right now, Google Search has monopoly power, but the US government  (unlike the Europeans,) will be slow to investigate or penalize them since they created something that is a global smash success.  That means it provides employment and tax revenue which delights the government.  If another powerful company (like Amazon, for example,) complained that Google was listing search results in a way that favored Google over Amazon, the Justice Department might launch an investigation of Google's business practices. A hundred years ago, monopolies were commonly organized as an entity inside of another legal entity called a &quot;trust.&quot;  Thus, laws against monopolies are called &quot;anti-trust&quot; laws.  Two examples of these laws are the Clayton Antitrust ACT and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government deals with monopolies either by breaking them up into smaller companies (Verizon and AT&amp;T used to be part of the same company) or they can have additional regulations that a non monopoly wouldn't have (they do this for example with water companies, since it isn't feasible to set up plumbing in such a way that people can choose water companies).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having a monopoly is not illegal. Creating a monopoly on the other hand is illegal and the government will try to prevent them if they think it will cause problems. Thats why you often hear of government needing to confirm large business mergers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
