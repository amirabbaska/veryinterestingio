		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>fish is pale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most fish is &quot;white meat&quot; (even salmon, which is pink because of fish diet, not because it's made of &quot;dark meat&quot;).  This is because these muscles are used for occasional movements and not for constant swimming.  The most common exception is some tuna meat, since tuna are very active swimmers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and flakes apart </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flakes you see are <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b162a317e5b89562d8074cae3c56493f" target="_blank">myomeres</a>, bands of muscle tissue in the body that allow the fish to swim with a fishy wiggling motion.  Most of the meat you eat from land animals comes from the limb muscles, and isn't segmented like this.  You can see the remnants of such segmentation on the body (eg, ab muscles) but even there it's not set up in the same way and doesn't provide the flake.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regards to colour, mammals have red muscles because of the presence of myoglobin. This protein is absent in the majority of the muscles found in most fish. Myoglobin is an oxygen binding protein that is found in muscles (Similar to hemoglobin in blood).</p>
<p>In fish the majority of the muscles (white muscles) are used for bursts of speed and are anaerobic (do not require oxygen). Due to not needing oxygen, an oxygen binding protein is not needed.</p>
<p>The grey flesh of the fish near the skin, is the muscles it uses to swim constantly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons for the difference, the main being the difference in lifestyle. The muscles of a fish are adapted for swimming, whereas muscles of mammals are adapted for moving on land. This means animals need larger, thicker muscles to combat gravity to walk around on land, instead of having natural buoyancy from the ocean. Therefore the muscles are flakier and less dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned gravity in these answers. Fish have a much finer skeleton and different muscle mass mainly because they are supported by the water against the effects of gravity whereas land animals have to fight gravity using their muscles to support themselves in an upright position. Fish muscles are therefore used in a different way. This is why pound for pound, farmed fish add mass far quicker than farmed land animals</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
