How would tides have been different? Would they have been bigger? Ocean currents, how would they have been affected with all that open ocean? What about storms like hurricanes? Would they have been super huge? I know that’s a lot of separate questions.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The formation of supercontinents has several direct and indirect impacts on the global climate. </p>
<p>Geometry of the huge global Panthalassa ocean basin and high sea level would favor tidal strength of less than half of its present-day value (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16307518" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL076695" target="_blank">2</a>). The distinctive equatorial configuration of Pangea and its comparable hemispheric distribution of land-masses are thought to have given rise to an intense seasonal reversal of winds, termed the 'Pangean mega-monsoon' (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018210001434" target="_blank">3</a>). </p>
<p>Construction of Pangea also had a profound impact on the deep carbon cycle because it played a dominant role in determining volcanic fluxes (CO2 source) and weatherability (CO2 sink), which is why a greenhouse climate much hotter than today ensued after the peak of supercontinent formation. The high-latitudes in particular were up to 40°C hotter and ice-free - something current generation climate models are unable to convincingly replicate. A vigorous ocean heat transport was invoked to explain the polar amplification of warming (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013PA002535" target="_blank">4</a>), however, physical arguments suggest that ocean circulation should be more sluggish during ice-free hothouse states. </p>
<p>On the other hand, elevated greenhouse gases are known to shift storm tracks of tropical cyclones poleward (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13278" target="_blank">5</a>) and there is geologic evidence that cyclone strength was amplified during greenhouse climates (<a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/29/1/87/191983/temporal-variation-in-the-wavelength-of-hummocky?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">6</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X15003532" target="_blank">7</a>). It has therefore been suggested that turbulent upper ocean mixing and polar cloudiness by stronger cyclonal activity represent a major driver of global climate during the Mesozoic and help explain the structural differences in climate between today and past warm intervals (<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/2007JCLI1659.1" target="_blank">8</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to Panthalassa (the ocean surrounding Pangea) not having any surface to break its momentum in the parts far from land, massive waves would form. Air in wet climates, especially oceans, is obviously humid, so the regions of Panthalassa that recieve more sunlight would be very warm, with the regions that recieve less being, of course, colder. This large area of differing temperatures would result in powerful winds, creating even larger waves, and the warmer regions would suffer powerful tropical storms. This would result in life that had existed in the oceans staying close to the bottom, just like marine life today does during hurricanes and tsunamis.</p>
<p>Regarding Pangea, the coastline would be very active, but the tides would dissipate due to the resistance from the rising ground near the shore. It’s possible the large tides are the reason as to why life had evolved to live on land, they were forced to. In the same way monkeys evolved to climb trees to escape predators, Tiktaalik had also likely evolved to survive longer after being beached.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
