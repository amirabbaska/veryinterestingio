		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was tested when there was no such thing as workplace safety regulations.</p>
<p>The first parachute jump of note is made by André-Jacques Garnerin from a hydrogen balloon 3,200 feet above Paris.</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci conceived the idea of the parachute in his writings, and the Frenchman Louis-Sebastien Lenormand fashioned a kind of parachute out of two umbrellas and jumped from a tree in 1783, but André-Jacques Garnerin was the first to design and test parachutes capable of slowing a man’s fall from a high altitude.</p>
<p>Garnerin first conceived of the possibility of using air resistance to slow an individual’s fall from a high altitude while a prisoner during the French Revolution. Although he never employed a parachute to escape from the high ramparts of the Hungarian prison where he spent three years, Garnerin never lost interest in the concept of the parachute. In 1797, he completed his first parachute, a canopy 23 feet in diameter and attached to a basket with suspension lines.</p>
<p>On October 22, 1797, Garnerin attached the parachute to a hydrogen balloon and ascended to an altitude of 3,200 feet. He then clambered into the basket and severed the parachute from the balloon. As he failed to include an air vent at the top of the prototype, Garnerin oscillated wildly in his descent, but he landed shaken but unhurt half a mile from the balloon’s takeoff site. In 1799, Garnerin’s wife, Jeanne-Genevieve, became the first female parachutist. In 1802, Garnerin made a spectacular jump from 8,000 feet during an exhibition in England. He died in a balloon accident in 1823 while preparing to test a new parachute.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early pioneers of the modern parachute tested it on themselves in demonstrations, with theoretical principles being their assurance.</p>
<p>Louis-Sébastien Lenormand made the first recorded public jump in 1783. This one was successful and he survived, and the concept moved forward towards improvement. That is not to say that other pioneers didn't fail in demonstrating their designs - though I can't find any information on that.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Blanchard conducted tests with a dog in 1785, descending from a hot air balloon. He tested his design on himself in 1793.</p>
<p>André Garnerin made the first &quot;frameless&quot; parachute jump in 1797, again testing the design on himself. This one was made of folded silk rather than its predecessors that were made from linen stretched over a wooden frame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related: according to this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC300808/" target="_blank">admittedly tongue-in-cheek article</a>, there have never been any double-blind placebo trials to test the efficacy of parachutes in preventing death. Of course, they mean it as a critique in over-applying the standard of evidence-based practice, not as a serious call for actually conducting the research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The early parachutes did not work like modern parachutes - they had rigid frames and therefore did not need to be deployed by pulling ripcord. The most logical thing to do would be to use a weight such as a sand bag or a sack of rocks/potatoes/whatever to test and then move on to human tests from a small height with a human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
