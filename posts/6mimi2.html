<p>Why do young infants eat anything from carrots to prunes to peas but when they become toddlers, they'll only eat chicken nuggets and french fries? Not only that, but as they get older, they start to have a more sophisticated palate. I'm still learning to like new foods all the time myself, and I'm in my mid-twenties. Why?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infants are naturally curious. They often make faces that adults perceive as disgust when trying new foods, but it can just be a reaction to something they've never had before. It's new! There is a repeated exposures principle that suggests an infant or child should be exposed to a food 5-20 times before concluding that they do not like it. As kids get older they often become neophobic (afraid of new foods) and parents often pressure the kids to eat. Someone else mentioned that toddlers are at the stage where they are learning to exercise free will and will often rebel against eating the food the parent is pressuring them to eat. Often times parents will get exasperated and default to kid friendly foods like Mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, and French fries. </p>
<p>If you'd really like to know more about child and infant feeding check out the <a href="https://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org" target="_blank">Ellyn Satter Institute</a> especially the <a href="http://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org/dor/divisionofresponsibilityinfeeding.php" target="_blank">Division of Responsibilities in Feeding</a></p>
<p>Edit: someone also mentioned that kids don't like bitter foods. This can be true and some people actually have a genetic variant that amplifies the taste of bitter foods making it more challenging for them to accept vegetables. I still think acceptance greatly depends how the vegetable is prepared.  <a href="http://www.prevention.com/food/healthy-eating-tips/new-gene-variant-identified-makes-vegetables-taste-bitter" target="_blank">Do you have the gene that makes you hate broccoli</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything you're giving them is a flavor explosion they have yet to experience, outside of breast milk or formula. As you feed them more things, they discover that &quot;Hey, this thing is my favorite so far&quot; and since they're babies...they don't want the mashed broccoli anymore, they only want the apple strawberry sauce. Food, especially less sweet ones, take multiple time for the palette to acquire a favorable taste, which expand as we grow.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, small children are biologically designed to not like bitter foods because bitter=poisonous.  So it's quite natural for them to have to learn to like some things.  Most of us outgrow that as we get older.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is just a power struggle, plain and simple.  The little one figures out that if they refuse what they are offered, they will get what they want.  I've even heard of kiddos being so hungry that they would cry all night from refusing to eat what was offered.  That is too much for most parents when the solution is simply giving in.</p>
<p>I was a pretty picky eater when I was young.  I just found something I liked and that's what I always wanted.  It wasn't the same thing all day every day, but the lunch I carried to school was the very same thing 5 days a week, for 5 years.  I don't remember not wanting other things, and my mom offered to make me other stuff, but I had my favorite and it was simple.  I was in my late 20s before I started to try &quot;new&quot; things.  My sister was shocked the first time I mentioned having Thai food.  I hadn't even tried rice until I was nearly 30!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They have no choice and can't express themselves. The parents are just shoveling food into their faces and the baby can't do anything about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when they become toddlers, they'll only eat chicken nuggets and french fries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point they know they like these things and the parents aren't really offering great alternatives. Do you think it is chicken nuggets vs buttered crab? Nope, it is nuggets vs mangled steamed vegetables. It is normal to not really prefer the things parents wish their children would choke down, and this is usually the tiny bit of self-determination they can try to obtain at this age. Everything else in their life is out of their control but they can close their mouths!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but as they get older, they start to have a more sophisticated palate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presentation is another point here. If you want to try octopus it can be a fun discovery, but if I sat you down and said you had to eat every sucker before you could leave the table and go to your room for bed (no, you can't stay up past 8 pm) you probably would feel differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that should be kept in mind too is that every child is different. My son (now 4) has always been a picky eater. He refuses to eat fruits and vegetables. This is partly due to his father's side of the family saying &quot;ew fruit/veggies are uky!&quot; And then refusing to serve them in my absence when they babysit while I'm at work. (Incase you were wondering yes his family is very overweight and yes I work with my son constantly to change his mind.) My daughter (now 2)eats anything and everything you give her without complaint. Carrots and broccoli? Yes. Bananas and grapes? Yes. Mom's dinner behind her back while she's taking care of big brother? Definitely yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
