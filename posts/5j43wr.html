		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heavy metal output of supernovae doesn't tell us much about the mass of the first stars, because the lifetime of the highest mass stars is only around 3-10 million years. Thus, there have been thousands of generations of stars since the Big Bang. We would need to observe extremely old stars to detect the influence of the very first stars- scientists are trying to do this, but don't get your hopes up.</p>
<p>The big difference between the first stars and later stars is that the first stars don't have any elements larger than Hydrogen and Helium in them, which makes them relatively transparent to light. (Edit: this means that the star is less (but still very) opaque not that it is actually invisible.)</p>
<p>In order for light to interact strongly with Hydrogen and Helium it needs to have the same frequency as one of its electron transitions (or ionizations), which is unlikely. Adding heavier elements greatly increases the probability that the light will be absorbed. As a result, the radiation pressure has a much stronger effect on modern stars, which limits their maximum mass and makes a collapsing cloud more likely to fragment  to make small stars. </p>
<p>We think that the first stars may have all had masses above 100 solar masses, so they would have died quickly by going supernova. But we're not sure - the first stars might also have had small masses due to other effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well we know that in the very early universe the first element to form was hydrogen, the simplest of all elements. So first stars were generated from this element. Mass, we speculate, had a large variation. Some were very massive, some were very very small. </p>
<p>Now all these stars begin to burn their hydrogen fuel, turning it into helium through various path ways. This is due to extremely high pressure from gravity. Then helium goes to carbon, iron etc... </p>
<p>But within these normal process there is no physical pathways that will form the heavier elements. So we know that heavier elements can't happen during a normal stars lifetime. However we are able to measure the current amount of these elements that exist in the universe by measuring the chemical composition of stars alive today. To make these elements we need much much more energy. This energy is only found in supernovae explosions. </p>
<p>During surveys of the amount of supernovae explosions, we can roughly determine how many supernovae happen over time. Using this and the current density of heavy elements we can determine how many elements are created in these explosions. </p>
<p>There are other less statistical methods. Using spectroscopic surveys of supernovae remnants like the crab nebulae we can also determine the amount of elements produced in these explosions. </p>
<p>Also low mass stars have extremely long lifetimes. Some first generations stars exist today, so we can survey them and determine everything about them from their chemical composition, radius, mass etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I don't see a conclusive answer yet, so let me put forward <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-stars-in-the-un/" target="_blank">this article.</a></p>
<p>In the article, Dr. Bromm suggests that the first stars could've reached anywhere between 300 or up to even 1000 solar masses, making them gargantuan even by stellar metrics. The reasoning behind this is that the first stars would've had absolutely no metals in them, and their simple compositions would've made traditional heat transfer methods more difficult. This would allow more mass buildup before the proto-star blows away it's cloud. </p>
<p>I can't tell you everything we know about first stars, but I can say this: with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, we are going to learn a lot more about the first stars. The JWST's unmatched infrared resolution will allow us to see redshifted visible light from the very edge of the luminous universe, and will thus help us answer many questions about the earliest universe. </p>
<p>Sources: I have worked under Dr. Bromm. He's a great professor. I have also been part of NASA outreach for JWST</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a physics student getting my bachelor's, so take this with more than a grain of salt. I learned about Bose-Einstein condensates this year, which is a state of matter that only exists at extremely low temperatures and large particle density. By lowering temperature far enough, each particles waveform begins to 'flatten' in a way. This can simulate the behavior of particles under extremely high temperature and pressure, similar to conditions immediately after the big bang. MIT (?) I believe has a fantastic video on the topic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
