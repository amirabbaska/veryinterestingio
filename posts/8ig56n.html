		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food was rare back in the days which meant that throwing it away could have terrible consequences as long as it was still somewhat edible. Cooking possibly couldve happened by someone accidentally dropping food into a fire and because they wouldnt want to throw it away they ate it. Wine was probably similsr by forgetting about some grapes and they started fermenting. A lot of things happened most likely by accident because food was scarce and hard to come by...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For example, in the days before deep understanding of chemistry and proteins, how did anyone figure that mixing salt with soy beans and wheat and letting it ferment for a few weeks - then eating the resulting smelly product (soy paste/soy sauce) would actually taste good/not kill you?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cooking is something that may have caused humans to evolve differently from other animals. We are tens of thousands of years removed from our primative ancestors. While this may seem like a long time nowadays based on technology progress, it is actually a very short time scale for evolution to happen.</p>
<p>Therefore, our bodies have not changed much from our ancient ancestors. Our bodies are not well-designed for raw foods. In contrast to other animals, humans have very small jaws compared to head size. We cannot chew as much as other plant eating animals. Many plant eating animals spend a great deal of their day chewing up their food to aid in digesting it. Since humans are omnivores, we also eat meat. But our small jaws doesnt allow for large muscles to tear and rip apart raw meat. Have you ever tried to eat too-raw meat? It ends up extremely fiber-y and tough to chew.</p>
<p>So how have we managed to survive while still powering our extremely energy-draining large brains? Cooking. Cooking breaks down food so that it is easier to eat. Easier to eat means less time spent eating and more calories that can be digested from the meal. It's not that humans discovered cooking but cooking is what allowed us to evolve into humans. Therefore it is hard to pinpoint how exactly we discovered how to cook.</p>
<p>Fermentation is a form of cooking but using bacteria, yeast, and/or mold to break down foods before we eat it. Fermentation was necessary because there really wasn't many ways to store food, especially in regions where food rots easily. Fermenting foods use a &quot;good&quot; edible rot that prevents &quot;bad&quot; or poisonous rot from living on the food. This way, fermented food can keep longer and we also get the benefit that it is partially digested (more nutritious) and free from poisonous rot. </p>
<p>How did we discover it? Foods pick up the spores of these microbes from the air. Sometimes we are lucky to have good rot taking over the food. Someone may have decided to try older stored food only to realize it was edible and may have tasted better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
