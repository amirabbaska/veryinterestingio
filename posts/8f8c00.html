		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons -</p>
<p>1 - It was horrendously expensive.  Like... really expensive.  The Americas are a long long way from England and the passage was not easy.  Shipping any amount of troops would be a serious feat of logistics.</p>
<p>2 - It was not their highest priority.  We Americans like to think that our Revolution was a big deal.  We forget that while we were doing our thing England was battling France, Spain and everybody else off and on.  If England focused all of its might on quashing the Americans then perhaps France would snipe out other colonies or even attack England directly!</p>
<p>3 - It wouldn't have fixed the problem.  They did take Boston, and Philadelphia, AND New York.  That didn't stop the Americans.  We just kept fighting in (as we put it) a good old fashioned &quot;Indian war&quot;.  The British had to quash American resistance completely, taking major cities didn't do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston" target="_blank">did <del>siege</del> capture Boston during the war</a> and did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_campaign" target="_blank">capture Philadelphia as well</a>.  So, they did both those things, they were just defeated in the long run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The British took all three of those cities. The problem was, the revolution was not in these cities. I mean, yes, the main players got together every once in a while to write and plan and talk, but they lived all over the place.</p>
<p>Whatsmore, they organized the revolutionaries in a way similar to what the French Underground did during WWII. The really invested people set up cells in their various towns and districts. Some in each cell kept in touch with other cells nearby while others organized or ran activities within the local cell. Others were not in the day-to-day, but would jump in to do something when manpower was needed. They had message carriers who could run information, including some very sophisticated cipher systems, and ways to conceal the fact that the carrier even had paper on them. One cell is taken down, five more remained standing; and whatsmore, the people in one cell likely didn't always know who all was in another. It's hard to tattle on someone you can't identify.</p>
<p>The same was true with battles. Once the fighting had started, there WAS a small standing army, but each area also had small militias that would show up and haze the British whenever/wherever they were. Hide in hedges and woods and take pot shots. Blockade ports and major roads to prevent ship and supply movement. Sabotage. Get servants serving British command and governor posts to talk about what they overheard on the daily. That sort of thing.</p>
<p>This sort of uprising is very difficult to suppress with military force-- in fact, it is part of the reason American forces are still in Afghanistan over a decade later. It is part of why the Vietnam war was such a boondoggle. And it is why the American upstarts were able to hold on long enough to interest the French in joining the war.</p>
<p>[The things the others said are important factors as well, but I won't repeat them redundantly here.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Awesome question. I can add a little tidbit as to why moving on major cities wouldn't have done anything.</p>
<p>I once lived in a small PA town near the Delaware River. The post office was an old mill. The old mill was a front...for a foundry where cannon balls were made. They were then taken by canoe down the creek to the Delaware River were they were given to General Washington and his troops. This town is as rural as you can get in PA.</p>
<p>Another small town that I once lived in near that same place that made cannon balls, once hid the Liberty Bell. Washington himself supposedly stayed in the town for a brief time. </p>
<p>The American Revolution was unstoppable. The British were never going to stop it, just like law enforcement was never going to stop prohibition (alcohol or any other drug for that matter.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
