		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so first thing to note is that light is an electromagnetic wave, the photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force. When we're talking about optical effects, we are talking about electromagnetism, which means there are only three (mostly two) particles we have to consider: Electrons, Protons, and Photons.</p>
<p>Electrons and Protons both respond to the electromagnetic force, but Protons are almost always shielded by an atom's electron shell, so they almost never interact with light. Electrons inhabit orbitals, which are basically imaginary shells that surround the nucleus of an atom. They can move from one orbital to another by gaining or losing energy, but they have to gain or lose enough energy to move a while number of orbitals. For example, an electron could jump 2 or 3 orbitals, but not 1.5 orbitals. </p>
<p>When a photon approaches an atom, if the photon can excite an electron into a higher orbital, that photon is absorbed, then the electron jumps back down to its original state (electrons always want to be in the lowest available orbital) and releases a photon of slightly lower energy as the atom recoils, having absorbed some of the photon's momentum as heat (heat is just kinetic energy at tiny scales). If a photon doesn't have the right energy to excite an electron, it passes right on by, if it hits an atom directly, it is deflected rather than absorbed, which lengthens the path the light takes through the material, which is what causes the speed of light to appear to change in different materials. This is why glass is transparent to visible light.</p>
<p>A reflective surface has a lot of free electrons, which are not in orbitals and thus don't have to absorb specific photons to be excited (though they will have trouble with very high energy photons because they just knock electrons right out of the metal, or fly right through them via quantum tunneling), so they take all comers and and reflect them according to the same rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Light is a wave (or a particle, or both, but we'll stick to wave) of electromagnetic radiation which travels through a variety of media (air, vacuum, water etc.).  Visible light is made up of several different wavelengths which we see as colours.  The important thing here is that, as a wave, it is carrying energy.</p>
<p>When light hits an object, it can be pass through, be absorbed, reflect or scatter, or any combination of these.</p>
<p>When the light wave hits the mirror, the energy from the lightwave is absorbed by the atoms.  This pushes electrons into higher energy states.  This isn't a stable condition, and so the electrons release the energy.  In a perfectly reflective surface, all of the absorbed energy is spat back out, perfectly mirroring the incoming energy.</p>
<p>Across the entire surface of the mirror, this leads to the light being absorbed and then spat back out in a way that produces a &quot;good&quot; reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone else has said is correct; photons (light) being absorbed by electrons (subatomic particles) will excite them, and then they emit their own photon of equal wavelength. You can see <a href="http://s298.photobucket.com/user/msimmond/media/Absorption-1.gif.html" target="_blank">this</a> diagram for a visual aid. What this doesn't explain is why <em>metals</em> (which are basically mirrors without glass in front) are so good at reflecting light.</p>
<p>I would like to go into the Chemistry aspect of this, though, if it's not too late -- since that is the study of atoms, after all. Note: it may help to have a periodic table open in another tab. &quot;Free electrons&quot; is a term I saw in another answer. This basically means that the atom has a lot of electrons not strongly attracted to the parent atom. Can you guess which atoms have the most free electrons?</p>
<p>The answer is metals! Check out a periodic table, and the whole middle section will be the transition metals. If you think about some of the characteristics of metals, they can be explained by their electron structure. First, they're good conductors of electricity, something that directly deals with electron exchange, and second, they're shiny, which relates to what we're talking about. They're also strong at oxidizing, which is part of why batteries work the way they do. Hell, their electron structure is the reason that when you breathe, oxygen gets transported around your body the way it does.</p>
<p>This is where the Chemistry begins. Again, I recommend a <a href="http://www.ptable.com/Images/periodic%20table.png" target="_blank">periodic table</a> if you're reading this. I'm going to try and put this into ELI5. I'd be happy to explain if I don't do it justice.</p>
<p>Basically, around every atom, there are electrons. These are separated into orbitals, named <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>f</em> orbitals (don't worry about <em>f</em>, that's some Nuclear Chemistry shit). Only the outermost orbital contains electrons usable in reactions, and these are known as valence electrons located in a valence shell; the other ones are tucked away for the most part. Obviously, as the orbitals grow and grow in diameter, they get further and further from the nucleus of the atom, and are less attracted to it. This is what that &quot;free electron&quot; reference meant; these really far-out electrons are only barely associated with the nucleus and are pretty much free to do whatever they want. Metals have valence electrons in the <em>d</em> orbital (which is the middle chunk of the periodic table), and so have plenty of free electrons when compared to an atom with valence electrons in the <em>p</em> orbital or <em>s</em> orbital.</p>
<p>Metals are, to conclude, what makes mirrors shiny. As long as the surface is very, very flat, metals will reflect light very well. I hope I have explained why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visible light is on the order of nanometers (nm; 10^-9 meters), and a silver atom is on the order of picometers (pm; 10^-12 meters). You could guess that the light is much larger than a single atom. This is why we cannot see individual atoms or molecules with regular optical microscopes - the light wave just goes around the atom. <strong>But</strong> if you pile up those atoms by length, width, and depth, eventually the large area will be big enough to intercept the light wave and bounce it back. I couldn't tell you though if a single atom is responsible for bouncing it back by chance or if multiple atoms can bounce light back, that's out of my jurisdiction</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons are not particles.
Photons do not exist.
Not before the radiation is emitted, not during emission, not after during transmission and not during radiation absorption.
They are a convenience of explanation of a quantum physics process.
Energy exists, matter exists.
Energy can act as if it were a particle when interacting with matter that collapses the wave function.
It has the effect of a particle but it never is one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
