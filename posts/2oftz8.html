		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep ocean water is generally pretty cold, so let's assume it's near 0 degrees C. Based on the phase diagram of ice:</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png</a></p>
<p>Water will turn to ice at just under 10 kBar of pressure. One bar is equal to about one atmosphere of pressure, so we're looking at nearly 10,000 atmospheres of pressure. Water pressure increases by about 1 bar for every 33 feet of water. So, 33*10,000 is 333,000 feet, or just over 50 miles. By comparison, the deepest known ocean trench is the Mariana trench, which is about 6.8 miles deep at its lowest point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>At earth gravity that would mean approximately 100 to 1000 km deep - which is 10 to 100 times deeper than the Mariana trench, the deepest part of earth's ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what kind of question you're actually asking here. Are you asking about water that would freeze and remain at the bottom of the ocean? Because that is impossible. As soon as water freezes it becomes mostly freshwater, because water freezes slowly enough that is will not trap the salt inside of the crystaline structure of water. As soon as this water freezes it becomes much MUCH less dense than  the saltwater around it. This will cause it to begin floating towards the surface, there the pressure goes down, and the temperature will go up, melting the ice again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably will get buried, but oh well.  Your best bet would to look at a phase diagram for water. Most people don't know this, but waters phase is dependent on temperature as well as pressure and density. The consequence of this is that you can have solid H2O at room temperature if the pressure is high enough. But, I wouldn't exactly want to be there under those conditions, as the pressure is likely to be much greater than atmospheric pressure. There is also a point in a phase diagram, called the triple point, where any increase or decrease in temperature, pressure or density will change phase to solid, liquid, or gas depending on the direction of change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
