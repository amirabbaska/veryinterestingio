		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even while not in a deficit, fat is your primary avenue of energy consumption. Different intensities of exercise determine where energy is converted from. Easiest example I will use is track and field. </p>
<p>(anaerobic)100-200 meter sprint= ATP-PC (adenosine tri phosphate/ phosphocreatine)</p>
<p>(glycolytic)400-800 meter sprint= carbohydrates</p>
<p>(oxidative)1600 meter+ = fat (which is why distance runners are always super lean)</p>
<p>Now each of these metabolic pathways do have over lap. You will never burn purely one energy source at a time.</p>
<p>During a normal sedentary day, you are burning primarily fat but not very much. Same with while you are sleeping.  Now on a low carb day, once your body uses up all its carbs (glycogen/ carbs that have been stored in the muscle) it will then resort to only breaking down muscle into to glucose. Lastly, breaking down fat will occur since it is the most abundant source of energy. In addition the process of gluconeogenesis occurs when there are non carb sources left which is the body's way of &quot;creating sugar from sciency components such as lactate or glycerol because sugar in a more readily available form such as a carbohydrate does not exist&quot; But I will need a bio chemist/ exercise physiologist to confirm that process because that is still foreign to me.</p>
<p>The average person can walk 500 miles on the fat energy stores alone. It is the primary source for energy, but the hardest to convert, which is why losing weight is so difficult. </p>
<p>Having a lot of fat is ideal for survival, so while it is the largest source of energy, it is the hardest to convert.</p>
<p>SOURCE- Kinesiology graduate</p>
<p>EDIT: hey neat, GOLD! Judging by comments and corrections, take this information as general explanation, all the reddit biochemists/med students are tearing me up! My degree has prepared me for &quot;this is how you can lose weight&quot; more so than &quot;physiologically, this is HOW you lose weight&quot; so I apologize for some misinformation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make an analogy: imagine your body is a cabin in the woods with food in the cabinet, food on the table, and the rest of the food in winter stores in the cellar. </p>
<p>If you use some of the food on the table for energy (muscle energy), eventually you will put more food on the table by taking it from the cabinets (your liver). One the cabinets start getting low you either buy groceries (eat food), or you open up the winter stores (fat reserves) and prepare some food for the cabinets and table (replenish the liver and muscle stores). </p>
<p>Your question is akin to 'if I eat all the food on the table, do I use up food in the cellar? and the answer is not immediately,  but without replenishing the food from an outside source eventually you got to get it from somewhere and that's the long term food storage (fat) </p>
<p>Your body has a few buffers in place to prevent you from suddenly having critically low levels of energy available. You store some fuel in muscles, ready for very fast and rapid energy like running away. You store more in your liver in the form of glycogen and fatty acids. When you fast for a few days it's your liver that is providing most of that energy. One the liver is tapped out you will find a sudden drop in energy and you will feel very lethargic and weak. Over the next few days the body ramps up it's fat burning metabolism and you will come to a stable state with better energy but you can deplete it quickly with prolonged activity. </p>
<p>Now imagine that you ate at any point in that, your body would use some of that for immediate energy, but it would use the rest to try to replenish the energy stores consumed already. If you burned more than you ate, you have a net loss of calories from your energy stores and you lose weight. </p>
<p>A deficit of 3500 calories is 1lb of fat. </p>
<p>The general answer to your question is no. Your body doesn't take energy from fat when you skip a meal or two, but longer term it may have to burn fat to replenish your liver and muscle stores. You could say that if you burn energy and don't replenish it, that eventually it results in fat loss. If you are not eating enough calories for a long enough period of time your body goes into a ketone metabolism where the body switches from running on fats, proteins, and sugars, to mostly running on ketone bodies produced from metabolizing your fat stores. Once you begin a ketogenic metabolism from lack of calories, then the body gets faster and more efficient at using up your fat stores so eventually yes you are burning more fat with less of a buffer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
