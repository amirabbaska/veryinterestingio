My understanding is that it’s used to make obscure the lines and aero features of a new car, but my question is how, considering that it’s relatively easy to distinguish a car’s body features regardless of detailing, and why the camouflage looks the way it does. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a modern usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage" target="_blank">Dazzle camouflage</a> which was originally used to help obscure what class of ship it was along with making it hard to tell its distance and speed.</p>
<p>Car camo doesn't usually hide what model of car it is, the reporters can generally tell that, but it does mask any specific curves or indents in body panels.</p>
<p>Camo isn't meant to be perfect, that's impossible, its just meant to make it more difficult to discern the details of the car and hopefully keep certain details under wraps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By having that unique camouflage it prevents other car makers from very accurately seeing what the curves and lines of a competitors car actually are.  You can get a general sense but with aerodynamics even tiny changes play a big part and there’s also the whole “how the car looks and appeals” to people. </p>
<p>You may not think it’s a big deal but car companies spend millions developing concept cars and even a slight edge over the competition can make or break a company. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other answers saying how the dazzle style camouflage disguises the shape of the car.. here’s the important bit: the camo makes photos of the car much less interesting to people who read car magazines.</p>
<p>They’re not secret agents trying to pretend it’s not a car, they just don’t want leaks - to the public - of what it exactly looks like. If you see it un-camouflaged just with your eyes, eh whatever. If you take a photo and share it with Car And Driver etc and everyone sees the new design, that’s a big problem for their launch plans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The intent is to keep the &quot;look&quot; from aging before the car is released. If pictures of a fully-painted car get out sooner, the company loses some number of months on its &quot;newness&quot;. The camo makes pictures less useful by making the car harder to visually analyze as a prospective customer - so you don't intuitively think &quot;That's an older model&quot; when it's released.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need something to keep people anxious and waiting for the new car to come out... It looks really ugly covered in wraps and vinyl, so when it comes out and you see it in a beautiful Soul Red with nice wheels it will still look like a new design</p>

<p>Tangent thought: Would this pose any challenges for an autonomous car's image analysis?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
