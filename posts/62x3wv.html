<p>Without underwater cables it would take weeks or months to have a decent international conversation so given the importance of a telegraph link, and the fact that the technology existed (The first telegraph was about 100 years earlier, and the first transatlantic ship was about 300 years before that), the rest was a question of will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They'd already mastered telegraph lines on land, so what they needed for underwater cables was a way to waterproof them. Unlike today, when we have all kinds of artificial substances, they could only use natural ingredients. So one of the vitally important substances that allowed them to do this was gutta percha, which allowed them to waterproof the cables. It comes from a tropical tree. Once they learned this waterproofing technique, they used existing tech to lay the cables. It was dicey at first and there was a lot of trial and error. </p>
<p>By the way, if you want to read about this in depth, Neal Stephenson wrote about the history of trans-oceanic cables in his book of essays, <em>Some Remarks</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They basically did it the same way we do it today -- send out a ship with a huge amount of cable on a spool, and let it gradually play out and sink to the bottom.</p>
<p>The main advantage we have today is the use of submarines so that maintenance can be carried out if necessary, but by-and-large once a cable's resting on the ocean floor nothing is going to disturb it anyway, so even without submarines they were able to run underwater cabling quite successfully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was very difficult but possible with the level of technology available in the 19th century.  However, the potential payoff of linking continents by near instant communication was huge, big enough to prompt people to do it multiple times.  </p>
<p>The cables were similar to what is used today, a very thick armored sheath covering a few wires (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Piece_of_first_transatlantic_telegraph_cable_at_the_Rupriikki_Media_Museum.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Piece_of_first_transatlantic_telegraph_cable_at_the_Rupriikki_Media_Museum.jpg</a>) (nowadays, fiber optic lines have replaced the signal lines).  Massive reels of this cable were loaded on the biggest available ships and slowly laid down (an early steam powered cable laying vessel: <a href="http://home.bt.com/images/ss-great-eastern-beached-136399284792903901-150716153822.jpg" target="_blank">http://home.bt.com/images/ss-great-eastern-beached-136399284792903901-150716153822.jpg</a>, and an illustration of one of the giant cable reels: <a href="http://atlantic-cable.com/Cables/1857-58Atlantic/Coiling-Cable.jpg" target="_blank">http://atlantic-cable.com/Cables/1857-58Atlantic/Coiling-Cable.jpg</a>).  Cable breaks happened (as they do today).  The earliest ocean cables were laid by sailing ships, but steam powered ships became common not long after.  The break could be roughly located using the electrical &quot;echo&quot; that occurs when sending a signal down a long wire.  A repair ship would sail out and dredge up the cable, where it would be repaired.  </p>
<p>The technology didn't come out of the blue.  Long distance land telegraph lines were already common.  There were some early underwater lines which ran for much shorter distances (like between England and France).  This helped establish the basic technology before ocean crossings were attempted.  </p>
<p>There was  no in-line repeater/amplifier technology at the beginning, so the extremely powerful signal sent on one end of the cable was extremely weak on the other end.  There was no widespread electrical grid.  The telegraph would be powered by large lead acid batteries.  Because of the extremely long distance weak signal, non-standard equipment was used.  A &quot;mirror galvinometer&quot; used a small mirror and magnet hanging from a string, which could be deflected by the tiny signal that made it through the cable to &quot;read&quot; the signal.  Non-standard signals were used as well for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Morse code was not yet the universal standard it became</li>
<li>Many cables linked to non-english speaking countries which didn't use Morse code anyway</li>
<li>The poor signal quality over the extremely long cables made other signal systems more attractive.  </li>
</ol>
<p>The earliest cables could send only one signal at a time.  Each end would have a schedule and would swap &quot;sending&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; rolls at prearranged intervals.  The code had to be sent slowly as well, since the signal was very weak.  Given the very limited bandwidth, sending a trans-oceanic message was extremely expensive, writing a letter and sending it by ship was much more economical but far slower.  Most signals would have been business or government messages as opposed to personal.  </p>
<p>Technological improvements gradually increased the capability of the trans-oceanic cables:</p>
<ol>
<li>The invention of electrical amplifiers improved signal quality and the speed at which messages could be sent on a cable.</li>
<li>The invention of multiplex technology allowed one cable to send and receive at the same time instead of switching rolls.</li>
<li>Cable design improvements reduced breakages and allowed for more than one wire per cable.  </li>
<li>Human operators initially did all sending and receiving.  Eventually, mechanical punch card reader/writers replaced direct human signalmen and allowed for signal speed increases.  </li>
