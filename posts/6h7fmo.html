		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be able to tell the difference, by sight, that something is a disc rather than a dot, your eye needs to be able to detect the difference in angle between light leaving (say) the right and left edges of the disc.  Planets and stars are so far away that our eye can't resolve this angle.  It all just looks to our eye like it's coming from one place.  </p>
<p>Whether it's a huge sun at an extreme distance or a small planet at an extreme distance, either way our eye can't detect anything more than that there is light come from a particular spot.  Our eye doesn't have the resolution to be able to detect that the light from the right and left edges of the body is coming from different places.</p>
<p>Think about it this way; imagine you are looking at a really pixelated picture of a small very bright light against a pitch black background.  All you can see in the photo to represent the light is a single big white pixel.  Now imagine you are looking at a picture of a much smaller very bright light against a pitch black background.  It will <em>still</em> look to you in the photo like a single white pixel.  There isn't enough resolution to tell the difference </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of the concept of angular resolution. Basically, any given aperture has a smallest possible angle that it can resolve, with the size of the angle being directly related to the size of the aperture. In our case the aperture is our eye, and it can see things of approximately an arcsecond or larger. Anything smaller than that, i.e. Stars, planets, etc. appears to be that size, regardless of how small it actually is because our eye simply can't bring it into focus on our retina at the true size. The light is blurred out to this minimum resolution, and thus most stars look the same size. </p>
<p>Edit: The bigger the aperture, the smaller the size it can resolve as well. This is why we build telescopes with huge mirrors. On earth they are also limited by what is called seeing, but in space, telescopes can be made bigger and bigger and the image will become clearer and clearer. (In theory)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The size of the detected subject = the true size convolves with the resolution of the detection system.</p>
<p>When the size is much smaller than the resolution of the system, the detected size = the resolution.</p>
<p>Our eyes have a limited resolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even the most perfect eyes have something called a &quot;point spread function&quot; (PSF) that describes the quality of the image, and it makes point sources into extended blobs. It has to do with the wave nature of light.  Anything smaller than the PSF looks to be about the same size.  You might find the pictures in this wiki interesting:</p>
