Also why doesn’t it help when I turn the AC off but still have the fan blowing air from outside at the window? Shouldn’t that equalize it?? </p>
<p>Edit: RIP my inbox. Thank you for so many answers. Please do not share more Mark Rober links there are like 5 in the comments already! If you want more of an in-depth answer there are several recommendations down there to look him up so do it! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of air as a sponge. However the temperature of the air determines the size of that sponge and how much liquid it can hold. The colder it is, the less water the sponge can hold. The air always has some amount of water in it, this is air humidity. When the air touches the cold windshield, the &quot;sponge&quot; shrinks and suddenly can't hold all the water it was holding. This extra water is dropped off and left on the windshield. This is fog.  </p>
<p>In order to defog the windshield you need to remove the moisture. The best way to do this is to use a big dry sponge, (warm, dry air). Generally the humidity inside the car is higher than outside so ideally, you want to use warm air that is coming from outside with the AC on.  </p>
<p>Part of what the Air Conditioning does is reducing the humidity. So when you turn the AC off and just blow outside at the windshield, this will eventually work, but is left efficient. An important note, AC doesn't always refer to cold air. The AC can be on while hot air is coming out too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moisture fogging the inside of a windshield is caused by warm air filled with water vapor hitting the colder glass of the windshield. This is much like liquid collecting on the glass  of a iced drink on a hot and humid day. The warm water vapor comes from you and the other living beings inside the car.</p>
<p>Thus, the defogging has to address both causes: the difference in temperature and the moisture. Air from outside is less humid than inside and can cools the air to the windshield temperature. AC with warm air heats up the glass to reduce the temperature difference and AC dries out the air. The choice comes down to if you want it hotter or colder in the cabin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air holds more water when warm.  When cooled, it will drop the water.  So if the air in your car is warm and has enough moisture in it, when it touches your cold windshield it will drop the water and fog up your window.  To stop this, you can -  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn on your defroster and set it as hot as possible.  It will blow hot air on any moisture there, evaporating it, and it will heat up your windshield so it won't be colder than the air in your car any more.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn on your defroster and set it to middle temperature (i.e. the same as outside).  Eventually the air in your car will be the same temperature as the outside air and it won't condense when it hits your windshield.  Note that you'd get the same effect faster if you just rolled down your windows while driving.  </p>
</li>
<li>Turn on your defroster and set it to as cold as possible.  It will probably fog up really badly at first, but then it will clear up, especially as your run the wipers.  Your AC acts to remove moisture from the air in your car.  Then, with the windshield <em>colder</em> than the outside, the outside air will condense water on the outside of your windshield where your wipers can conveniently wipe it away.  </li>
</ol>
<p>All three work, but the first is by far the fastest (and convenient on cold days when you want heat in the car anyway).  The third works fine if you don't want hot air blasting in your car (such as on a hot, muggy day) and can live with your wipers on to continuously clear the fog forming on the outside.  The second is really really slow unless you just roll down your windows, and then you have to live with whatever the climate is outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on exactly what kind of problem you’re experiencing.</p>
<p>The key concept you need to internalize is that <strong>fog/frost occurs whenever humid air meets a relatively cool surface.</strong> This is true whether it’s your car or your house or a glass of soda pop.</p>
<p>If there is fog on the <em>inside</em> of your windshield, that means that the air <em>inside</em> your car is humid and the windshield is relatively cool. You can either fix the former problem by running the A/C (which is—first and foremost—a dehumidifier), or fix the latter problem by heating up the windshield (by blowing warm air on it). For maximum effect, turn on the A/C, blast the heat, and set the airflow to blow at the windshield. In most cars this is possible, even though it may seem like a contradiction. You also might want to try buying auto glass cleaning wipes that are specifically designed for the inside of the windshield.</p>
<p>If there is fog on the <em>outside</em> of your windshield, that means that the air <em>outside</em> your car is humid and the windshield is relatively cool. You can’t control the air outside your car, so just focus on heating up the windshield. Most likely, all you need to do is ease up on the cooling. Maybe open a window. If you live in the south and the heat is unbearable, point the airflow at your feet for a while. Running the wipers may help—if it doesn’t, buy new wipers and use a better cleaning solution.</p>
<p>If there is <em>frost</em> in the outside of your windshield, it means the air outside your car is humid and the windshield is relatively cool. Same problem, really, just a different season. Heat the windshield. And bust out the scraper.</p>
<p>If there is frost on the <em>inside</em> of your windshield, buy a new car. Or move.</p>
<p>Edit: notice that all of these solutions involve heating the windshield. A warm windshield is a dry windshield. That’s why the rear windshield has those lines on it—they are just little electric heating strips. Land Rovers used to have them on the front windshield too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
