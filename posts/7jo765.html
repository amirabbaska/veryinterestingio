		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually this is due to ischemia- lack of blood. When you're sitting in a position too long your body tells you to move, whether or not you realize it, to get the blood flowing back. If blood is robbed from an area of your body for too long, the tissue dies.</p>
<p>If you don't move, you get something called a pressure ulcer. Pressure ulcers have four stages and a last stage called unstageable. They are not pretty sights (do a google search). People get these because they cannot move when their body tells them to. Thus, the blood flow stops and the tissue in the area dies. In the hospital, we have turn schedules for our paralyzed patients to turn them every hour or two so their flesh doesn't die. </p>
<p>When you're sleeping, your body is unconsciously moving to keep that blood flowing all while you rest peacefully. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try to remember the last thing you were thinking about right before you decided your current position was uncomfortable. You’ll often notice that an anxious thought can trigger your sympathetic nervous system into gear, releasing cortisol and causing alertness.  Your first reaction to this new state is “I must be uncomfortable” and you adjust.  If you are constantly tossing and turning throughout the night it could be because of a number of physical or mental stressors in your life. Poor diet, stressful work day, lack of exercise, too much exercise, eating too late at night, financial or relationship issues, scary or intense movies right before bed, too much caffeine, consuming alcohol, not keeping a regular sleep/wake schedule, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
