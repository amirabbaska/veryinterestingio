		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Planet habitability is an active area of research, so there is a lot to say about it. But since your question specifically asks about planet atmospheres, I'm going to focus on that.</p>
<p>An important factor to consider is the planet's escape velocity (how fast a particle of gas has to be moving to escape the planet's gravitational influence). Less massive objects (like the Moon and Mars) have lower escape velocities, so it is difficult for them to retain atmospheres. It's also important to remember that a strong magnetic field would only help prevent some forms of atmospheric escape (such as that involving solar winds). However, since there are multiple mechanisms by which a planet can lose it's atmosphere, the existence of a magnetic field is not always sufficient for atmospheric retention.</p>
<p>So we know that planets with low masses have trouble retaining atmospheres, but what about planets with higher masses? It turns out that exoplanets with masses a few times greater than Earth's tend to have gaseous envelopes (sort of like a mini-Neptune). This is because the planet's gravitational force is so large that it can accrete a lot of gas when it's forming, and its escape velocity is so large that it's hard for the gas to escape. In these situations, the surface pressure of the planet would be too great for us to live on it (but who knows, maybe there are some aliens that can).</p>
<p>The last thing to consider for habitability is atmospheric composition. Just because a planet has an atmosphere doesn't mean it's habitable (like Venus). To find out if a planet is truly Earth-like, we need to measure the composition of its atmosphere.</p>
<p>So, in general, there are four things we need to determine to find out if a planet is habitable: its orbital period (to determine if it's in the habitable zone), its mass (to find out if it's massive enough to retain at atmosphere), its size (to find out if it has a thick gaseous envelope), and its atmospheric composition (to determine if it has an Earth-like atmosphere). Luckily, we can make all of these measurements today on both Solar System bodies and exoplanets, and our precision is only getting better with time.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention one thing. Knowing the properties of the host star is also important when determining each of these properties. Specifically, we need to know the luminosity of the star to determine how far away its habitable zone is, we need to know the size of the star to determine the size of the planet, and we need to know the mass of the star to estimate the mass of the planet. Also, since the compositions of exoplanet atmosphere are determined by studying the light from the star that passes through or reflects off of the planet's atmosphere, it's important to characterize the star's spectrum.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're correct that the habitable zone is a flimsy concept, largely because there's such a wide variance in terms of converging conditions that have to be present to allow life (as we understand it) to form. Although, bear in mind that as we discuss this, we're understanding life <em>from an Earthlike perspective</em> (i.e. a carbon-based, homeostatic organism that can employ metabolic processes and reproduce), and since we're trying to draw a line with a single point, we're inevitably going to be hamstrung by that.</p>
<p>/u/creamulum already has an excellent response breaking down the most important factors, but I'll try to focus on a few areas that are also (as we know) critical for the sustenance of those factors. These ones are particularly critical for Earth in particular, and we have reason to believe the same for other planets.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Geologic/geochemical activity.</strong> A planet being able to grab an atmosphere is all well and good (in fact, it seems to be quite common, given that all planets in our solar system have them to one degree or another), but a planet being able to keep a stable atmospheric composition of elements that are conducive to is just as important for life to thrive. Atmospheric gases are (relatively) easy for a planet to get, whether by asteroid impacts or just simple gravity, but even if the planet has a magnetosphere to protect the gases from being blown away by the solar winds, the gases will eventually dissipate or condense or be ionized and vanish from the planet. <strong>To keep those atmospheric gases</strong>, one excellent way we know of is to have the planet be geologically active. Shifts in the planet's crust and heavy volcanism can release large amounts of gases (called &quot;outgassing&quot;) into the planet's atmosphere, since the heavy pressure and temperatures in the mantle of the planet can break down, liquify and evaporate the solidified elements that originally formed the planet. Plate tectonics also plays a role by constantly moving around the surface of the planet, sucking volatile or toxic compounds back into the mantle and bringing up fresh rock (this is called &quot;crustal recycling&quot;). These compounds can be anything (on Earth: water vapour, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, potassium, and especially nitrogen), but it's important to have them around <em>constantly</em> and <em>for long periods of time</em> to prompt life to arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Atmospheric patterns</strong>. Another reason why the habitable zone is a flimsy concept is because even if a planet can keep an atmosphere composed of biogenic elements, that's no guarantee that it will be able to sustain a life-friendly climate (see: Venus and Mars). However, atmospheric weather patterns can help with this, because what kinds of patterns a planet has can make or break its potential for life, because the atmosphere can both redistribute cool or warm gases around a planet to make it a more stable temperature, or keep gases in one place for the same purpose. This is <strong>very</strong> complicated and I respect the shit out of planetary meteorologists who can wrap their minds around it, and there are many factors that influence this. Just one of them is planetary rotation: a planet spinning too slowly may not have enough motion in its atmosphere to properly distribute gases around the planet, but one spinning too fast may have significant storms or not maintain consistent-enough temperatures for life to for or thrive. Another factor is temperature: since hotter gases move faster and rise while cooler ones move slower and sink, planets that are too hot or cold (or who become as such due to an asteroid impact or catastrophic event) may have their atmospheres either—functionally—evaporate into space or literally freeze due to the extreme temperatures.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Stellar activity</strong>. Another major factor we have to look at is what sort of star(s) the planet is orbiting around. Most of the exoplanets we've found so far orbit around red dwarfs: small, dim and relatively cool stars that make up more than 70% of the stars in the universe. However, red dwarves don't just have the problem of life-possessing planets needing to be so close to them that they'd be tidally locked (i.e. only one side faces the star at all times, due to gravitational tides), they're also extremely temperamental little stars. Red dwarfs regularly throw out solar flares that could ionize most of a nearby planet's atmosphere, and because they're so small, they can be covered in sunspots that hugely dim their radiation output, potentially freezing nearby planets as well. Conversely, any planets around high-mass stars would face similar troubles, and likely wouldn't be around long because high-mass stars generally live under one billion years before exploding as supernovae. Compare this to our Sun, for example: a G2-class star of medium size (that's still bigger than 90% of the stars in the universe) and middle-age, that only rarely undergoes significant solar events like sunspots, flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). </li>
</ol>
<p>I could easily go into more factors (e.g. whether a planet is in a system with a lot of gravitational chaos that may cause it to be kicked out of its stellar orbit; a planet's neighbours that may ward off or increase the likelihood of suffering comet and asteroid impacts, etc.), but point being that there's a lot of them. We're building better telescopes all the time to investigate these factors though (especially atmospheric composition), and I suggest you check out the <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">James Webb Space Telescope</a>—set to launch next year—which will be specifically designed for that purpose if you're interested.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well one way astronomers can see if a planet is habitable is by looking at its atmosphere.  This is done by looking at the spectrum of light that passes through the planets atmosphere from its sun as it passes between its sun and the telescope.  Lots water in the atmosphere is considered very important for life to form.  I'm sure people will comment below with more, but if you have the time here is a good video series on the topic:<br />
