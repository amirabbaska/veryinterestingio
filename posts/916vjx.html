		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, a series of tunnels were dug from below where the new dam would be, going upstream through the rock - four tunnels, each 50 feet in diameter.  The entrances were cleared LAST, of course, so they wouldn't flood, and were protected by cofferdams, which are temporary dams around a riverbank that are basically just walls stuck into the bottom of the river.  When the tunnels were ready, the cofferdams were literally blown up.</p>
<p>Once the tunnels were built and the water diverted, NEW cofferdams were built across the river at the tunnels to protect the Hoover Dam construction site and keep it dry.  Then build the dam, close the diversion tunnels, and let the river fill up the space behind the dam.  The cofferdams protecting the Hoover Dam construction site didn't actually have to be taken out, because, remember, Lake Mead is deep but the river was not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great video from Modern Marvels on Hoover Dam construction. Four tunnels were created out of solid rock to channel the river around the dam site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK5Rq8gViA" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK5Rq8gViA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK5Rq8gViA</a></a></p>
<p>Skip to 16:49 to see how the Colorado River was diverted around the dam site.</p>
<p>Edit:  skip to 13:53 for animation of the construction process showing the tunnels and coffer dams.</p>
<p>Life was cheap during construction, 112 men died.  The first to die and last to die were father and son,  J. G. Tierney and Patrick Tierney.</p>
<p>If you visit Hoover Dam, take a tour, you get to go inside the dam and walk along one of the inspection tunnels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you create a diversion channel that goes around the site of the dam. Depending on the location of the dam, this can be a tunnel through rock, or just digging a temporary riverbed around the site. Next, you install a cofferdam upstream and downstream of the location of the dam. This forces the water into the diversion channel(s) and leaves a dry area for the dam to be built. Once the dam is finished, you collapse the cofferdams and the diversion channels and the river flow returns to normal, just with the dam restricting flow causing a reservoir to build up behind it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They started off building two tunnels going around the site of the dam. These tunnels were built above the waterline. They then dumped truckloads of rock and dirt into the river blocking it and creating a small temporary dam. The water level behind this dam rose until it came up to the tunnels which were built and diverted the water away from the construction site. This allowed the construction workers to work on the dam on the dry river floor. The dam includes valves which allows the river to flow under the dam if needed. The diversion tunnels also have valves which allows them to be sealed. When the dam construction were done the valves were closed off and the water level were allowed to rise to the top of the dam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
