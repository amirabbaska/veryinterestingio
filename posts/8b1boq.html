		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lock has a number of tumblers, which all need to be pushed to a certain height in order for the lock to turn. Each key is unique, and the bumps on the key correspond to the heights of the tumblers within the corresponding lock.</p>
<p>Imagine keys and locks as a 6 digit password. Now imagine that your kitchen lock is only a 4 digit password - the kitchen lock only has 4 tumblers, not 6. So your keys can all open the kitchen door if they have the right 4 bumps, but you can't open each other's doors.</p>
<p>Imagine the kitchen door is 0134. Imagine your door is 013461 and your roommate's door is 013413. You and your roommate can both open the kitchen because your keys have 0134 (which is all the kitchen needs,) but you can't open each other's doors because your keys don't match the lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully, this works with Reddit formatting:</p>
<p>This is the kitchen key:</p>
<p>O=\^\^\^-&gt;</p>
<p>This is your bedroom key</p>
<p>O=\^\^\^M&gt;</p>
<p>This is your roommates bedrooms key:</p>
<p>O=\^\^\^U&gt;</p>
<p>And your other roommate:</p>
<p>O=\^\^\^S&gt;</p>
<p>You all share the first part of the key, which unlocks the kitchen, but the last part of your key is different, and that's the part that unlocks your lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical locks come in varying degrees of security. </p>
<p>Your kitchen lock uses the least secure function of the key, which are the widest bumps on your key. Your individual room locks use the exact same wide bump patterns, but the narrower teeth of the keys are all different. </p>
<p>Your kitchen lock isn't precise enough to notice the differences in the tips/ridges/bumps on the teeth of your keys, whereas your bedroom locks are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your door locks will have an extra pin, or something similar. Basically all your keys have different bumps/notches but are mostly the same. the front door lock will only care about the bit that is the same, while the bedroom locks will care about all of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other users have said, locks have multiple tumblers. If you took all your keys and held them together, you'd notice they they all have probably 3 similar features, those are the areas required to unlock the kitchen, while any other peaks and valleys are what are required for your doors to differentiate those locks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
