Do different languages have varying degrees of 'effectiveness' in communicating? Can very nuanced, subtle communication be lost in translation from one more 'complex' language to a simpler one? Particularly in regards to more common languages spoken around the world.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the replies you've gotten so far are perfect material for /r/badlinguistics.</p>
<p>In general, linguists agree that no language is more or less complex than another overall, and <em>definitely</em> agree that all natural human languages are effective at communicating. This is in part because there's no agreed upon rubric for what constitutes &quot;complexity,&quot; and because there is a very strong pressure for <em>ineffective</em> language to be selected against.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>A few thoughts: </p>
<p>(1) information can be lost in translation, yes. More often than not, it's 'flavor.' That is, social and pragmatic nuances, or how prosodic and phonological factors affect an utterance. Translated poetry, to give an obvious example, will either lose rhythmic feeling and rhyme, or be forced to fit a rhythm and rhyme at the expense of more direct or idiomatic translation. </p>
<p>(2) You would have to define complexity, before you could answer this. Every time I've seen a question like this, what the OP defines as complexity is just one way of communicating information, and the supposedly more complex language is less complex in other ways. For instance, communicating the syntactic role of a noun phrase can be achieved either through case marking, or through fixed word order. Which of these is more complex? Well, one's got structural requirements at the phrase level, another has morphological requirements at the word level. Or here's another example: think about Mandarin and English. Mandarin has fewer vowels than English. Is it therefore less complex? What about the fact that it has lexical tone that English lacks? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do different languages have varying degrees of 'effectiveness' in communicating? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. In general, you'll find that the people who argue they do (1) have not ever seriously studied linguistics, (2) tend not to know how global languages became global languages -- through colonization in the last few centuries, and (3) tend to want to support overly simplistic narratives that are based on ethnoracial or class prejudice.  They're also often really poorly thought-out. For instance, I've seen a lot of arguments in this thread that English is somehow superior for math and science, claiming that speakers of other languages have to switch to English, or borrow words from English to do math or science -- while conveniently forgetting that English borrowed most of those words from Latin and Greek. And that the speakers of other languages they're holding as examples were educated in English in former English colonies, so they were taught math and science terminology in English rather than their home languages.</p>
<p>I would link to peer reviewed papers, but this is so fundamental to the study of linguistics that I'm not even sure where to start, honestly. The claims that a given language is more complex than another, or better suited to abstract thought, or what have you have all gone the way of other racist pseudo-science,= like phrenology...which is to say, long gone from academia, but alive and well on reddit.  ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<p>EDIT: I inadvertently put my last paragraph in the middle. Fixed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
