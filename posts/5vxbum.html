Even if they did reach that speed things would appear strange thanks to relativity.  What about the opposite though?  Is there an equivalent &quot;absolute zero&quot; speed?  Would there be any weird consequences with relativity?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolute speed would have to depend on absolute space and absolute time (since speed is a relationship of distance over time).</p>
<p>So, to have an absolute speed of zero, you would need to be stationary with respect to some absolute frame of reference, against all which is moving, moves. </p>
<p>Newton precedes you in the belief in such a system, however already in his own time, this belief was not universal, and has since been disproven. </p>
<p>General relativity tells us that there is no absolute frame of reference (actually, it tells us that all frames are relative, which is close but not the same as there is no absolute frame).</p>
<p>In fact, relativity tells us that in all of this there is actually only one thing which <em>is</em> absolute. The speed of light. </p>
<p>The closest we can come to 'zero speed' is by measuring our velocity against background radiation, in other words, relative to the average velocity of matter immediately after the big bang happened.</p>
<p>But the structure of physics precludes the existence of any 'absolute' or 'true' measure of space or time. Everything depends on the frame of reference from which you measure it. Everything, that is, except the speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what Scamp is asking isn't about an absolute zero speed in terms of relative motion, but rather if there could be something that appears stationary to all reference frames, the way light appears to have the same velocity to all reference frames. My gut reaction is definitely not, but it's an interesting thought experiment to try and imagine what that would look like. I'm going to spend some time considering this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speed isn't an absolute quantity, it only has meaning relative to a reference frame.  You may think you're at rest, but relative to a train passing by at 100 km/hr you're going 100 km/hr, relative to Mars or the start Alpha Centauri, you're also in motion.  There is no such thing as &quot;absolute speed&quot;, that is what &quot;RELATIVITY&quot; in special relativity means, all (inertial) reference frames are equally valid.  You, the train and Alpha Centauri are ALL correct about your speed relative to their reference frames.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, to have a concept of absolute speed you would have to start with some point in the universe that you knew was completely still, and measure everything's speed from there. But the universe doesn't have any sort of unmoving &quot;bedrock&quot; like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, temperature is average kinetic energy, so I would think absolute zero would qualify here since it is the absence of molecular movement. Any friction would cause it to stay just over that mark so logic dictates it would have to be absolutely motionless- &quot;absolute zero motion&quot; methinks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
