		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toothbrushes mechanically helps in cleaning teeth by scrubbing off the dental pellicle layer that has been invaded with bacteria and thus preventing the formation of plaque and its accumulation, getting rid of food particles that remain on the tooth surface that might not be visible to the naked eye. Modern day brushes focus more on being less invasive towards the periodontal tissue (mainly the gums) and being more reliable in consideration to the time and amount of force that the consumer applies during their brushing sessions.  Also back then when toothbrushes were not around, people often used alternative ways to brush their teeth (see miswak or teeth cleaning twigs).</p>
<p>In relation to toothpastes and saliva they help in regulating the pH of the mouth that occurs due to by products of carbohydrates fermintation by the bacteria in the mouth, acidic pH increases the rate of demineralization of the dental enamel and limits the mineralization of the dental enamel. Also toothpastes tend to have prophylactic components that aid in the exchange of minerals between the tooth and the oral cavity and some have anti-microbial and others with periodontal-friendly components, but mainly saliva plays an important role in maintaining the oral balance and dictating its hygiene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WOOOO finally a question I can somewhat answer.</p>
<p>Brushing your teeth removes the residue material left after eating. Even without eating food, your mouth accumulates a layer of film especially around the teeth called &quot;Bio-film&quot;.</p>
<p>This &quot;Bio-film&quot; is harmless by itself but as time goes by, the bacteria begin to reproduce and different kinds of bacteria colonize the mouth. Both quantitatively and qualitatively as the bacterial colonization continues the bio-film begins to harden and this is where the toothbrush comes into play.</p>
<p>This is called &quot;Plaque&quot;. You can dislodge plaque with your toothbrush. Bacteria does not &quot;evolve&quot; in the same way that we regularly use the word &quot;Evolution&quot;. That being said , the bacteria in our mouth is different than it was 1,000 years ago as oral care has improved. This is not because the bacteria have changed but because we have changed</p>
<p>Removal of plaque and/or the bio-film only causes for the process to repeat itself. This is why we need constant care. It is Streptococcus Sanguis that initially colonizes the mouth followed by mutans and a variety of others (Lactobacillius casei, Actinomices, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3392035/" target="_blank">This article</a> has a nice compilation and summary of oral care research studies, especially the section &quot;Tooth Brushing as a Standard of Care.&quot; With regards to how brushing itself (i.e. without toothpaste) cleans your teeth and mouth, it removes plaque by mechanical methods. Toothpaste, in its usual forms, aids in the cleaning of your teeth by the addition of abrasives. This is why toothpaste feels gritty. The abrasives in the toothpaste help get rid of more plaque by acting like tiny sheets of sandpaper that the arms (bristles) of your toothbrush rub on your teeth. This makes taking off the plaque more easy and polishes your teeth at the same time, resulting in squeaky clean teeth. </p>
<p>Now, how does brushing actually affect your health? The fluoride in toothpaste makes it so that your teeth have less chance to corrode and fall out, thus making areas for bacterial populations to congregate. Brushing removes plaque. Plaque is a biofilm, which is just a big collection of bacteria swimming in their own vomit pool. Biofilms usually produce bad substances (toxins, inflammatory agents, etc.) Less plaque means less biofilm. Less biofilm means less inflammatory agents. Less inflammation means less chance for open wounds and bacterial infection. </p>
<p>I didn't really look into how it has affected bacterial evolution, but I assume that the action of brushing hasn't affected bacterial evolution. The incorporation of antibiotics such as triclosan into toothpaste has definitely produced antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. On the bright side, triclosan has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8997654" target="_blank">anti-inflammatory properties</a> and has been shown to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23518778" target="_blank">help prevent mouth diseases.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't we be using other bacteria to fight off the cavity-inducing 'bad' bacteria? Isn't an abrasive method prone to potentially (and perhaps over enough brushing, even light brushing) wearing off the protective enamel coating teeth, thus requiring <em>more</em> brushing, creating a vicious cycle?  Also it's not like toothbrushes are entirely accurate, even if you're a vigorous and careful brusher, you're still going to have areas untouched, particularly in the interdental areas.</p>
<p>Couldn't we be using aspects of nature to fight its problematic aspects? I realise then you get mutations etc. at play but surely an adaptive bacterial solution is ultimately the way to go? </p>
<p>Imagine popping a small dissolving pill on your tongue every month, or even less frequently, and not having to brush and floss like a madman bi-daily in attempt to stave off <em>inevitable</em> decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question. Why is it that when people talk about cleaning the vagina or ears people say that you should 'leave your body alone&quot; and not interfere with your bodies natural cleaning process but demand that we clean our teeth? Clearly humans didn't evolve brushing their teeth. Is brushing and cleaning our teeth a victorian silliness that will one day be looked on with impunity or did the mouth somehow not evolve like the rest of our body to take care of cleaning? If so why? What evidence is there that cleaning our teeth does any good?     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
