		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cameras distort reality. Usually in subtle ways, but people who take lots of portrait shots will tell you that posture can make a world of difference, not because it changes the way you look in person, but because it strongly affects the way you show up on camera. I think some people instinctively have good camera posture and it does a lot for them. I'm even aware of extreme cases of people who look good in pictures even through they're not particularly attractive. </p>
<p>Thing you can do include: push your head forward a bit, not sure why but i do know part of it is to decrease the neck wrinkle. Turn your shoulders so they're not square to the camera, this is easy to overdo but a little bit will decrease your apparent size in a 2D projection, and curves are not apparent when viewed straight on. On that note, try not to let your nose break the plane of your face, this one is tough as the subject of a picture, but the edge of your face draws a strong boundary, and anything that crosses it is perceived by your brain to be much larger because it stretches across multiple zones. Of course, smile. Focus your eyes at the top of the lens, not the center. Hands on your hips helps to break up the lines of your body, making a more appealing photo composition. Lighting can be significant, but it's not like people get to have a lighting team following them around to perfect this, just try to put light sources off to your sides (like 2 and 10). Finally, take multiple shots! Most of the people who look good in pictures are the type of people who clamor to see the photo after, and are likely to complain that their hair was wrong or they blinked and they need another shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mind works very hard to keep a steady, consistent image of the world around you. So when you see someone in person, you always tend to see them the same way, regardless of where the light is coming from, how far away they are, and which angle you're looking at them from. This helps you quickly recognize someone or something no matter the context. You also form a stable image of a person that stays constant despite a changing environment.</p>
<p>On a photo, these things become much more apparent, because your mind doesn't have as much information to work with as when you're seeing someone in person. You can light someone from below or from above in person, and yet recognize that the subject looks the same, but is just lit differently. On a photo, your mind won't be so good at telling apart the lighting from the person, so you might end up perceiving that the person is uglier or prettier as the light changes.</p>
<p>Our minds are good at interpreting subtle clues. Maybe you can't accurately tell how big a person's nose is, but seeing even slight movement will help you better judge it. A slight shadow might give you an even better idea, and you'll know that it's a shadow, and not just darker skin. With a photo, these clues become a bit less obvious and that's why photographers have to be very careful with lighting, makeup and angles - it has much more impact on a photo. A small change in any of these things on a photo can make you look better or worse than in real life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many photos are distorted due to the way the lens &quot;sees&quot; the world. This distortion can be deliberate in order to introduce a specific effect or accidental due to inexperience. Extremely small focal lengths tend to exaggerate features that are closer to the camera (lips, nose, forehead) and diminish receding features (chin, jaw, ears) which can make a person look like vaguely alien. Pictures taken at around 85mm tend to be closest to what the human eye perceives. Much lower than that introduces distortions that don't represent reality as our eyes see it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find some people just have what I call animated faces.  They communicate with more facial expressions than most people, they exaggerate facial movements more than most other people, we find this attractive, you can be guaranteed though that when you take their photo they have one eye shut and their chin will be lop sided.  If you ask them to pose they feel uncomfortable and unnatural and the result is forced.</p>
<p>Try just talking to them while pretending you are setting up the shot, tell them a few jokes and fire off the shots while pretending to be fiddling with the camera.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In converting a 3d image like a person into a 2d image like a photo, some features are lost.  Part of modeling is knowing which features to accentuate in order to look right on camera.  When taking a photo one might stick their chin toward the camera, it looks weird in person but it prevents the camera from making you look like you have a poorly defined chin due to the flat image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
