		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what disease you're talking about. Whether this is a muscular or joint issue or whether it's to do with your organs. And, what medicine you're taking. </p>
<p>In your case you suffer from asthma. The respiratory system slows down and depresses during sleep, as part of your metabolism. Your airways are already narrower and more prone to inflammation due to the disease. Depression of the respiratory system  during the night makes it worse. The result is that mucuous builds up during the night. You may have also possibly had a chronic lack of oxygen during the night, aka sleep apnea.</p>
<p>If it was a physical ailment, such as arthritis. That can be explained through muscular and joint theory. Healthy muscles need constant movement. Often, at night one is stationary for prolonged periods of time. The stiffness you feel in the morning is a combination of two things. The muscles tightening dependent on your posture (a light version of the Contracture seen after strokes). And also, within the joint itself the fluid that lubricates the joint, changes viscosity, becoming thicker and stiffer. Movement and warming up in the morning counteracts these effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The side effects from the medicine that I take before bed are at their worst in the morning.   I would imagine that for some people,  waking up after a night of not having your medicine and it being time to take it makes the symptoms of their illness worse.</p>
<p>Even if you don't take medicine, your body's chemicals and hormones are going to change with the activity you are doing - sleeping, being awake, being highly active.  </p>
<p>I'm cool with the idea of having my consciousness put into a robot body, no more pesky human health issues. </p>
<p>...That got weird, but I'll stand by it.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your asthma is worse in the morning because you're encountering an allergen (dust mites, pet dander, pollen in the carpet that someone brought into the house on their shoes, mold) or irritant (like smoke, perfume, fragrances from the softener sheet and detergent you used when you laundered your linens) in your bedroom. You breathe that in all night, your asthma will be worse in the morning. If this is a problem more than once per week, you might need to increase the dose of your controller medication (which won't work at all if you aren't using your spacer). You should probably get your allergies tested and see if there's a better air filter you can use, and make sure you're limiting the allergens in your life: wash your sheets on high heat weekly with fragrance free detergent and softener; no pets in your bedroom (if your allergy test shows that you're allergic to them); inspect for mold; change clothes when you come home so you don't get pollen all over your house when you sit down. If someone you live with smokes, you need to talk to them about quitting, or think about moving. In the mean time, they should stop smoking in the house, and wear a &quot;smoke coat&quot; when they smoke outside, so the smoke doesn't get in their clothes and all around the house.</p>
<p>Other problems, like heart attacks and strokes, are &quot;worse&quot; in the morning because they actually happen throughout the night and are sitting there untreated for hours because no one is awake to notice what's happening, or the fact that it's getting worse. Similarly, if your breathing has been getting worse all night, you might sleep through it. If that happened during the day, you could use albuterol and breathe easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you measured the humidity where you sleep? I used to have trouble with my own respiratory system on winter mornings. Then, I bought a hygrometer and discovered that the ambient humidity was extremely low, particularly at night. I bought a small humidifier and my symptoms literally disappeared overnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
