<p>It's the animal instincts in our brain telling us that being &quot;hidden&quot; is superior to not being hidden, and helps us feel better, even if the coverage is useless at anything but warmth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Of course anyone can see when someone is under a blanket, but it might not be so obvious for an animal for example. Its just an instinct to hide when in a dangerous situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure on the scientific research behind this, but this is the theory I have heard. </p>
<p>The idea is that it triggers the same sensation in the body as if we are being hugged. In social animals, a sense of security/safeness is primarily attained (especially in the younger years) by physical proximity to others in the pack (hugging or touching). It triggers the attachment system, which is basically our &quot;cool down&quot; system. There are different groups of 'happy' or 'pleasant' emotions. There are the stimulating ones (excitement, accomplishment, pride), which feel good but also make us feel more energetic rather than relaxed. All those &quot;uppers&quot; are the ones that motivate us to go out and <em>do</em>. And then there are the soothing ones that promote a sense of security (warmth, connection, belonging, togetherness - which are all to do with our social needs and generally promote a 'relaxed' sense of being rather than an energetic sense of being). So we rely on this affiliation system to calm down and relax - these are essentially our inbuilt &quot;downers&quot;. The reason we don't literally need other people around all the time as we grow (unlike as a young child) is because we internalise the sense that we have people behind us (as in others care about us) and use this felt sense of connection to soothe us. Therefore, simulating the sensation of being hugged triggers the 'calm down' emotions, as does hugging a pillow or a soft toy.</p>
<p>Based on this theory there have been weighted blankets created for people with depression and anxiety as the extra pressure/sensation promotes better sleep and more of a sense of security.</p>
<p>As I say, this is the theory I have heard but I am not a scientist and have no actual expertise, so if someone else knows this to be bullshit, please do let me know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I suspect it mainly has to do with our evolution from very small furry mammals that were always fearful of predators.  Small creatures like that instinctively hide in tight little holes where bigger things can't get them, and feel terribly exposed when not covered.  Those instincts are not necessarily lost simply because you evolve to be larger.</p>
<p>I read an article once about a study on people's limbic system, which is a very primitive area of your brain, wherein resides the fear emotion.  By showing images of things to people and monitoring the response of their limbic system, scientists could see what triggered the most fear.  They found humans were by and large most instinctively frightened of (1) snakes and (2) spiders.  The scientists theorized that there was a time our evolutionary ancestors were being eaten by those things, and so those creatures evolved an instinctive fear of them.  That instinctive fear remains with us, even though snakes and spiders pose very little threat to us now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
