		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a video explaining it in pretty good detail:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW39sZY1PX0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW39sZY1PX0</a></p>
<p>Basically because Cops have to work long hours, such as nightshifts, and need to be able to respond at a moment's notice. As such there's not a lot of options for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the night. They also provide a place to sit down and take a quick break (or fill out paperwork in a place that's not the front seat of your patrol car) and you can take the doughnuts with you.</p>
<p>Funny story, when I was super young we went on a field trip to the local police station. As we were walking along the mezzanine above the staff break room I saw a box of doughnuts and a coffee machine on the table. Without thinking a blurted out &quot;IT'S TRUE! THEY DO LIKE DOUGHNUTS!&quot; causing the whole building to erupt in laughter and my mom (who was the chaperone) to go completely red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because for cops working the late night shifts they didn't have many options to go get a coffee and a snack as most places were closed at the hours they worked. Meanwhile doughnut shops were open so they became a frequent stop for cops to get some food and a cup of Joe. Since more places are open at later hours now they have more options but the association with doughnuts stuck.</p>
<p>Also doughnuts are quick so they could grab something and get back to work relatively quickly compared to late diners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historically, before 24 hour convenience stores and the like, donut shops were the first places to open, since they had to get to work before everyone else, so people could get coffee and donuts before work. When officers were working the night shift, from 10pm till ~4am, nothing was open. At 4am, officers would meet up at the first place open, which was the donut shops for food and drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I worked in a convenience store in the 1980s, we were the only place that was open 24 hours in our town, so all the cops would hang out there at night.   </p>
<p>Our company liked having law enforcement hang out there at night, because it kept trouble away. So, we offered four things to uniformed police officers: pop, popcorn, coffee, and donuts.   </p>
<p>Rather than eating a big bag of popcorn all night, the cops would take us up on the free coffee and donuts. So, if you came through my town in the middle of the night and saw a cop not in their car, they were probably in our store drinking coffee and eating donuts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Police work all hours of day and night and will want to take a break and a snack from time to time, but even on break they still need to be able to respond to a call if needed. In the past pretty much the only snack places open in the middle of the night were donut shops.</p>
