		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are only a few ways to desalinate water. One way is to boil and condense the water, a process called distillation. The problem with this is that it takes a relatively enormous amount of energy to boil water so it isn't practical. If we had limitless energy available to us then it would definitely be on the table, but we can't just pull huge quantities of heat out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The other way is to force the salty water through special filters which are fine enough to filter out the molecules of salt while letting the water molecules through. This also requires a fairly large amount of energy (pushing the water through requires a lot of pressure) and it also has the added trouble of fouling up the filters which need to be cleaned regularly.</p>
<p>Overall the process of removing salt from water is very difficult and usually not cost effective, compared to the natural water cycle where the enormous fusion generator evaporates water over hundreds of thousands of miles for free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Producing water with evaporation requires too much energy, it is used only in places where you have some free heat, like in a ship due to the Diesel engine.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis used to consume a lot of energy, but way less than evaporation / boiling.</p>
<p>However new materials make it way less energy consuming compared to several years ago, in Israel it is now used to provide part of the water supply in the country.</p>
<p>So to answer your ELI5, I would say, desanilisation is in the process of becoming a cost effective solution.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because water is <strong>extremely cheap</strong>.</p>
<p>The price people are willing to pay for water is almost nothing, so an energy intensive process like desalination can't compete with the vast sources of available fresh water.  Maybe on a cruise ship or submarine it's cheaper, but everywhere else just using existing fresh water sources is cheaper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is another element that connects some of the other items together.  If you take an amount of salt, and mix it with water, it ends up in a lower entropy state.  To convert it back to separate salt and water there's a minimum amount of energy you have to have the two separated.  There's no way around it.  There's all sorts of nifty tricks to try to get as close to perfect as possible, but no matter what, it takes a fair amount of energy.</p>
<p>A way to view this is if I take a bag of blue marbles, and a bag of red marbles, and mix them up, then want them sorted again, I have to spend some kind of energy to get it sorted out.</p>

<p>it will always take 1 kWh or more of energy to desalinate a cubic meter of seawater.</p>
