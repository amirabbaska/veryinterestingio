		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, this is my observation so I guess we can address whether its true or not.</p>
<p>I understand that if you took me ~150lbs trying to overpower a larger man ~250lbs in an &quot;oklahoma drill&quot; situation, its clear that I would most likely lose.  the speed of my moving X 150lbs vs the speed of him moving X 250lbs is what were dealing with in that situation.. right? </p>
<p>However i don't know how this translates to certain exercises. in my experience lifting weights, I've found that heavier people tend to be able to push more weight from the start when it comes to the bench press. I can logically understand that their muscles are stronger due to the increased  burden of carrying around extra weight all the time, but they're also carrying that weight while exercising, so I don't fully understand how that helps.</p>
<p>TLDR; How does one's mass come into play when performing strength exercises in a stationary position?</p></div></div>

<p>This is not super hard to understand, they carry around more weight constantly so they will build a certain amount of muscle just from doing every day things like getting out of bed, getting on and off the toilet, walking. Also, a high calorie diet is great for building muscle even if it is poorly balanced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that they generally have a greater amount of the non-impressive muscles and postural muscles that can't really be worked in the gym, they <em>also</em> generally eat more, have more energy stored in cells (called glycogen), and have more cellular creatine available.  Creatine helps the muscle cell make use of the energy it produces.  However, people with less body fat typically produce more testosterone and growth hormone (which helps them build/retain muscle) and are more sensitive to insulin (which helps sugar/energy sources get into their muscle cells).</p>
<p>This phenomenon can be observed in bodybuilders.  They &quot;bulk&quot; (eat more &amp; gain weight purposefully to fuel muscle growth) in their offseason then &quot;cut&quot; (eat less to slowly lose fat) to prepare for a show.  As they eat less and lose weight, their testosterone and growth hormone production increases.  This helps them to build and retain muscle.  Think of it as a built-in way of preventing our bodies from losing muscle when food is scarce.  They also have more insulin sensitivity, meaning sugar can get into their muscle cells more effectively.  For this reason, bodybuilders may actually get <em>stronger</em> as they begin to lose weight.  However, after significant weight loss, their energy stores and creatine (which we get from food and/or supplements) become depleted.  This means that after bodybuilders lose a lot of weight, they actually begin to lose some energy, become weaker, and even lose some muscle mass.  However, their fat loss generally &quot;outweighs&quot; the muscle loss, and they end up looking... like a bodybuilder.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their bodies are larger, so they literally have more muscle and more strength potential. You don't need to work to carry muscle around, do you? Other than that, they have bones and fat like everyone else. A person can lose fat and be predominantly muscle, and a larger/taller person will have much more of it, so they will be stronger. Pretty simple. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Leverages. No doubt, it's impressive to be extremely strong at a certain weight (i.e. Pound for pound strength or wilks score) But the strongest people in powerlifting tend to be extremely fat. It's easier to squat half a ton of weight when you have basically have a mini monster truck tire around your waist for support and to push off from.
1a. I didn't know how to describe this, so I'll describe it as a subpoint of leverages. When you're fat, your lifts also tend to have less distance to travel. For example, if your chest is extremely fat, how far does the bar have to travel up, vs if your chest is extremely lean? Doing partial reps of powerlifting exercises is a frequently used method, used partially (no pun intended) because they teach you to work through sticking points while not taking a huge toll on your body (vs compared to if you did the entire range of motion). So if you're fatter, you're probably limiting your range of motion inherently.</li>
<li>Body composition. While it's possible, it's unlikely two untrained people will have the same lean body mass at different weights. The fatter guy will probably have a higher overall lean body mass because he has to lift more weight overall on a daily basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, it's unlikely you will have two people of the same overall health at different body weights. Overall health encompasses many factors. But let's isolate two: cardiovascular health and overall strength. I'm currently 200 lb @ ~15% body fat, or 170 lb lean body mass. I can run a 6 min mile, but at a heart rate of 170 bpm. That's pretty good for someone my weight, but I would no doubt be faster or have a lower bpm at the same running rate if I was lighter. But I would also lose strength. Someone of identical height who is 170 lb @ 10% body fat would be able to run a faster mile if they trained for it. Because he'd be carrying less weight. But no doubt, he would also not be as strong as me.</p>
<p>As just a small example, based on my Fitbit data in the past, going from 200 lb to 185 lb, maintaining the same LBM, my resting HR would decrease by about 10-15% (which is good). But looking at my work out logs, my strength took a hit of about the same %. </p>
<p>Ultimately, based on changing weight alone (while using similar lean body mass), overall health is dramatically affected. If you changed overall lean body mass, the effects would be even more drastic. Then there are many other factors to consider.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
