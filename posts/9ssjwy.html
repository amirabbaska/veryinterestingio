<p>We don’t know why, but we have a vague idea of how.
Like previously mentioned, migraines are caused by brain arteries increasing or decreasing in size. We don’t know why such arteries increase in size or why it usually happens in one half of the brain or why on very few people it happens on both sides of the brain.
We know how some people get visual auras (depolarization/hyperpolarization) but we don’t know why, or why some people don’t experience them.
We know some people can have migraines while sleeping (I have).</p>
<p>I think we don’t really know enough to ELI5. </p>
<p>Edit: Wow, this exploded a bit, I promise to respond to comments in the morning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just learned about this in medical school:</p>
<p>The first thing is not everyone who has a visual aura has migraine pain and vice versa</p>
<p>Migraine pain occurs from blood vessels (in the tissue layer covering the brain) getting larger. This process, called vasodilation, is involved in the release of molecules that stimulate neurons responsible for pain. This molecule is called CGRP. New migraine medication is being developed to target and block CGRP from causing pain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Visual aura occurs for a different reason. The brain during a migraine goes through different cycles of electrical signals. In this cycle there is a massive overstimulation of circuits in the brain followed by a massive understimulation in the brain.  In science, this is called depolarization followed by hyperpolarization.</p>
<p>Eventually this cycling signal of periodic overstimulation reaches the back of the brain which is responsible for visual processing causing a &quot;visual aura&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor...and I don't play one on tv.  However, I've had migraines for about 31 years.  They started when I was in my early teens.  I've had just about every scan and test imaginable...and tried any/all remedies.  As I understand it, the current belief is that there's a hormonal trigger or a seratonin drop that starts a cascade of physiological reactions. Those reactions are what cause the vessels in and around the transgeminal nerve to dilate rapidly.  The pain isn't actually being triggered by anything in your brain; but, rather, you brain is processing a pain signal when it really isn't necessary.  Now, everyone has a different experience. For me, I've worked really hard to eliminate things that trigger my migraines...but, one of my triggers is weather changes.  I have a chiari malformation, which can sometimes result in a buildup of CSF in my brain...I have to accurately figure out if I'm having a migraine or if it's a fluid buildup because the treatment routes are different.  I don't get flashing colors in an aura...rather, I get an intense feeling of de ja vu or I feel like lights are too bright.  I'll notice very, very small noises the day before a migraine hits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: If you suffer from migraines check with your dentist to see if you grind your teeth.</p>
<p>I had my first experience with an aura when I was 13 but there was no migraine pain. Shortly thereafter I started getting classical migraines with visual aura where I would go mostly blind for an hour, then it would dissipate somewhat and be followed with 8-14 hours of intense pain, nausea, and vomiting every 30 minutes like clockwork. </p>
<p>It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I got a new dentist who took one look at my mouth and said &quot;You know you grind your teeth right?&quot; I had no idea. He prescribed an NTI-type night guard that tricks the brain into thinking the incisors are touching so even when you're asleep your lizard brain knows not to clench down that hard. </p>
<p>I know there are some criticisms of NTI guards in that they can change your jaw position or your bite, but it changed my life. I went from having a migraine every 1-3 months to maybe once a year, now it's even less frequent. </p>
<p>To anyone struggling with migraines I definitely suggest ruling out bruxism (teeth grinding) as a cause. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
