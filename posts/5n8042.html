		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was talking with my buddy about CO2 emissions and got on the subject of natural sources. Volcanoes and forest fires and such. Then it proceeded in to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires" target="_blank">Kuwaiti oil fires</a>, so I googled it.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The total amount of oil burned is generally estimated at about one billion barrels. Daily global oil consumption in 2015 is about 91.4 million barrels;the oil lost to combustion would last 11 days at modern usage rates.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So I assume that this would cause a spike in the atmospheric CO2, but when I look up charts, I don't see a spike? What's the best most accurate chart? I'd assume something like the NOAA would be up there. When I look up others, like <a href="https://www.co2.earth/co2-acceleration" target="_blank">CO2.Earth</a>, there's actually a big drop in emissions around that time. </p>
<p>I'm not a data guru, maybe I'm missing or misinterpreting the data. Can someone maybe shed some light on this? </p>
<p>Update: The idea before this was answered was, with all that extra CO2 belching into the atmo with little effect, is CO2 really that bad if the Kuwait fires aren't causing a huge spike. And I didn't like this, yet if it was the case and what my conclusions drew to, then I guess I'd accept it until someone taught me better. But thanks to thanks to /u/CrustalTrudger, for cranking out some math so my brain could understand and see the big picture and 180ed the train of thought that was heading down a track that I disagreed with. Now I'm thinking, if all the oil being burned barely made a dent in overall CO2 emissions, man, we humans pollute <a href="http://thewritepractice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Alot-vs-a-lot1-600x450.png" target="_blank">alot!</a></p>
<p>THANKS EVERYONE!!! I'M HAPPY I DIDN'T GO FULL RETARD ON CLIMATE CO2 EMISSIONS:-)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You kind of answered your own question with the quote, the only thing you need to add is the duration over which the Kuwait oil fires burned. They didn't all start at once and were not all put out at once, but from the link you posted, the peak of oil fires was late February 1991 and concerted efforts to put them out started in April 1991 and the last one was put out in November 1991. Even if they only burned from February to April, you have the equivalent of 11 days of CO2 combustion spread out over 3 months (when in reality it's spread out over longer), so there's really no reason to expect to see much of a spike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the numbers others have given, it's important to note that most CO2 records are sampled at a specific location. The source you're looking at is from Mauna Loa, which is about as far away from Kuwait as possible on Earth. Even though CO2 emissions affect the entire globe, it takes months, possibly even years for a pinpoint source of CO2 to be mixed equally throughout the atmosphere of the entire earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting question and so fascinating to hear all of this!</p>
<p>If you are curious about the methods of how exactly the fires were put out, I highly suggest this <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L77BSBKvMJk" target="_blank">IMAX</a> flick called &quot;Fires of Kuwait&quot;. Countries from all over the world chipped in some tech knowhow and there's some awesome footage. The Texans explosive method and the Hungarian's &quot;Big Wind&quot; methodologies are some of the coolest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your premise includes a false assumption: You're conflating pollution from an oil fire with CO2 being released into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>This idea may be easier to understand with wood, if you have any experience with fireplaces or camping fires. When you get a good, hot fire going there is relatively little smoke and virtually nothing left of the wood. When your fire is not burning efficiently then there is relatively thick smoke (and big husks of charcoal left over that didn't get hot enough to burn). That thick smoke contains carbon from the wood and it collects elsewhere as soot. If you monitor the CO2 around a &quot;clean&quot; burning fire compared to a &quot;smoky&quot; fire you'll find the fire that appears dirty is actually producing significantly less CO2, even as your sensors would collect ash and soot from the poor combustion.</p>
<p>Which leads us to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daily global oil consumption in 2015 is about 91.4 million barrels;the oil lost to combustion would last 11 days at modern usage rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...if it were refined and very nearly 100% of it burned, leading the carbon in the oil into atmospheric CO2. That isn't even remotely what happened in those oil fires. All of that thick black smoke contained unoxidized carbon. To be clear, that is some very nasty pollution, but burning a billion barrels of oil in open fields will generate far, far less CO2 than if it were burned as fuel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question! And there <em>is</em> a spike, if you look at the data closely enough.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html" target="_blank">https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html</a>, click on the <em>Interactive Plots</em> tab and scroll down to the first chart, labelled <em>Mauna Loa Monthly Averages</em>. Zoom into the region at the beginning of 1991. If you hover your mouse over the chart, it will tell you which data point matches which month.</p>
<p>Look at the blue line, which filters out the seasonal fluctuations. Notice that little peak in April 1991. That's your spike.</p>
<p>Why isn't the spike more pronounced? There's a lot of smoothing going on. The gases will be thoroughly mixed by the time they reach Mauna Loa – that's why we measure the gases there – and the mixing is temporal as well as spatial. Not all of the CO2 release in Kuwait in early 1991 would be detected at Mauna Loa in 1991. There are lots of other places where the CO2 can go!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
