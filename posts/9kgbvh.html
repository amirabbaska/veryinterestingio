		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I made a video:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DYGcLBQoyUw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/DYGcLBQoyUw</a></p>
<p>Please forgive the crudeness, I spent 5 minutes on this so it’s not the best experiment, but it does demonstrate the concept.</p>
<p>I did not have a skateboard, but I had a platform on casters. I put an empty plastic bin and metal basket on top to give the umbrella ground clearance. The umbrella,  leaf blower,  plastic bin, and metal basket weigh less than 7 pounds combined. The casters on the bottom were locked in place so that they only rolled in one direction. The platform easily rolls back and forth with very little effort when pushed or pulled. The blower did slightly move everything forward, but it is slight. The weight of a person would be too much for any movement. It barely moved with 7 pounds of weight on the platform. It does move forward though.</p>
<p>Edit:
I made another video to demonstrate the umbrella on the wheeled base with the leaf blower not attached. I used the leaf blower in my hand to direct air into the umbrella and it had no trouble at all moving forward. </p>

<p>Edit part 2:</p>
<p>I put the leaf blower on to the wheeled platform and aimed it at my garage door. It had no trouble at all moving.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immediate &quot;obvious&quot; answer most people will give is that no, you will not move. This is obvious because the blower will experience a backwards force and when that air hits the umbrella it will experience a forwards force that cancels out. Conservation of momentum and all that.</p>
<p>What's obvious in an ideal world doesn't actually hold true in the real world. There are two problems with the above explanation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The backwards force experienced by the leafblower is not necessarily equal to the forwards force experienced by the umbrella. Fluid dynamics isn't very nice at being symmetrical, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_sprinkler" target="_blank">Feynman sprinkler</a> as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>Conservation of momentum actually states that the net force is <em>not</em> zero. The air starts stationary behind the blower, and ends up with some velocity after it hits the umbrella. Either some air gets redirected back or some air makes it past the umbrella. With a correct shape and large enough area, the situation described will actually cause the skateboarder to move forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a real life analogue of the OP's situation, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_reversal" target="_blank">reverse thrusters</a>. Those are identical to the situation described, yet they clearly cause a net force in the direction of the &quot;umbrella&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, this is a conservation of momentum problem. </p>
<p>Let’s say the blower pushes 1kg of air every second and its travelling at 10m/s. Therefore every second the blower pushes you back at 10kgm/s.</p>
<p>Now by the time the air hits the umbrella, some of the air is lost (misses the umbrella) and the remaining air slows down due to air resistance. Let’s assume 0.9kg of air hits the umbrella every second and it’s travelling at 9m/s. However, the air doesn’t just stop when it hits the umbrella, it gets redirected backwards (back towards the leaf blower). It won’t go directly back towards the blower but would rather go at a bit of an outward  angle, let’s say at 10 degrees to the umbrella handle. This means that the air is now going at 9xCOS(10) = 8.9 m/s backwards towards the blower. The air hitting the umbrella has therefore changed velocity from 9m/s forward to 8.9m/s backwards = change of 17.9 m/s total. Therefore every second the umbrella pulls you forward by 0.9x17.9 = 16.1kgm/s.</p>
<p>The net result of the blower and the umbrella means you are pushed forward by 16.1-10=6.1kgm/s every second. Alternatively, you could drop the umbrella and point the blower backwards, in which case you would be pushed forward by 10kgm/s every second. </p>
<p>I’m summary, yes you would move forward, however you would be better off getting rid of the umbrella and pointing the blower backwards instead</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little thought experiment For those of you in the “it can’t move forward” camp.</p>
<p>Remove the umbrella.
Replace with a piece of tubing over the end of the leaf blower.
Bend the tubing so it is pointing 180° back on itself.</p>
<p>Which way now?</p>
<p>What is the tubing doing that the umbrella can’t (at the correct angle and distance!)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1CXB7_gm8I0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/1CXB7_gm8I0</a></p>
<p>Now: As to the actual physics, think about flow of energy. In the initial system with leaf blower turned off, all energy is potential and is stored in the battery (or gasoline) of the leaf blower. When you turn the leaf blower on that energy is exerted to turn the motor within the leaf blower which creates a relative negative pressure behind it and positive pressure in front of it. The positive pressure region has air with some kinetic energy now in it. As that are travels fowards it exerts a force on the umbrella which now has relatively higher pressure on the leafblower side and lower pressure on the other side. The air however now cannot continue in it's original direction and is redirected sideways and backwards from the direction of the umbrella, which by Newton's third law requires the air it pushes against to exert and equal and opposite force of it and vicariously the umbrella. </p>
<p>From this we can see that the skateboarder will move forward. QED. </p>
<p>EDIT: Woah! Thanks for the gold! </p>
<p>EDIT 2: A much easier way to understand this problem intuitively is as follows. Imagine standing in your lawn with the umbrella in one hand and the leafblower in the other. If you turn on the leafblower and aim it at the umbrella what will happen? It is very easy to see that you will be &quot;pushed&quot; forward and fall on your face. Now replace that lawn with a smooth surface and a skateboard and you are suddenly moving down the road. </p>
<p>EDIT 3: Jesus Christ people.... For those who need more convincing. </p>
