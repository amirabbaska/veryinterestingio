		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fill a sink with water, hold a cup upside down and push it straight down into the water. You'll see that the water can't get into the cup because the air is in the way, and the air can't get out because the water and glass have it trapped. If you tip the glass over a little some air can escape from the raised edge and some water gets in to replace it. The air is stuck because the water is trying to push it up.</p>
<p>Water can get into your nose and ears, but you need to keep your head tilted far back or to the sides to give the air a path to get out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Air displaces water. If the air can't flow anywhere water will simply not get into the crevice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why doesn't air go in your nose?</p>
<p>Because in order for air to go up your nose, it would have to fight against gravity (because your nostrils open from the bottom) while at the same time pushing air out. The force required to do that is too much so it just doesn't go up. If you did a somersault underwater, water can get up into your nose and nasal cavities, but again, it would still need to displace the air and fight against gravity; now that you're upside down the air would have to travel up to go into your lungs.</p>
<p>Why doesn't it go in your ears?</p>
<p>Because your ears have a thin film of skin (your eardrums) which prevent water from entering. If you turn your head to the side while under water, your ear facing up will &quot;fill&quot; with water, but only up to where your eardrum is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
