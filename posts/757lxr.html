		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to think of it is by imagining the ear drum as an actual drum. The pop in the ear is the pressure inside and outside the ear normalize and is equivalent to loosening a tightened or tightening a loosened drum diaphragm. A loose drum wouldn't be able to correctly reproduce the high frequency noise while the tight one wouldn't be able to reproduce lower ones. Fixing the pressure lets both extremes go back to normal. However, because your brain has been hearing suboptimal reproductions, it increases the sensitivity of what signals it gets. So when the ear goes back to normal everything is obviously very different and optimal making the crisp clear hearing. But then over time you get used to it, brain doesn't have to strain as much and it feels like it's back to normal </p>
<p>Edit: [source] (<a href="http://www.entnet.org/content/ears-and-altitude" target="_blank">http://www.entnet.org/content/ears-and-altitude</a>) for u/Wootery similar effect except in this case the pressure differential is due to altitude</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For you to hear, your eardrum needs to move in and out. If it's too far pushed in or out, it won't be able to move properly, so you can't hear so well.</p>
<p>Your eardrum sits between your outer ear (connected to the outside world through your ear canal) and your middle ear (which exchanges air with the atmosphere through a tube that ends in your nasal cavity). That tube opens when you swallow, chew, blow your nose, etc.</p>
<p>The pop you hear is the tube opening and the eardrum being centred again. It does sound like your tube isn't working well, which is causing your middle ear to not equalise in pressure normally, which causes your eardrum to push one way or the other. It could be caused by infection, age, or just how your body is built.</p>
<p>This could indicate or cause problems, so if it is something that happened recently and hasn't gone away, I'd speak to a professional about it. I'd definitely speak to someone if I had a related sinus/nasal infection, pain in the ear, or persistent hearing loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is not normal - the pop is normal, but your hearing should be the same before and after. It sounds like something may be impeding the movement of your tympanic membrane or ossicles (hearing bones) most of the time and relived for a short time when you pop your ears. That could be wax outside the ear drum just touching it, or something deeper in the middle ear or maybe even something in your throat that is keeping your middle ear blocked (the Eustachian tube is what's responsible for equalising the pressure inside your middle ear and letting fluid drain out so that you can hear).</p>
<p>A normal audiogram doesn't mean your hearing is perfect. You may be able to hear the full range of frequencies but that doesn't mean you can hear them clearly or perfectly, or all at the same volume.</p>
<p>You could try wax removal drops like Otex or Olive oil first to see if it helps, but it's probably best to go and get a doctor to have a look inside your ear (and even throat) and decide how further to look in to this for you. I would NOT start randomly using medications like Flonase if I were you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep down in the bottom of your ear is a little drumskin. </p>
<p>On the other side of that drumskin is a little room about the size of a lima bean. </p>
<p>On the floor of that room is a little tunnel that leads to the back of your throat. That little tunnel opens occasionally to let fresh air in and flush out any moisture to the back of your throat. </p>
<p>Sometimes, when you're sick, the little tunnel swells up or gets blocked. Air can't get into that little room so a little vacuum forms. That vacuum sucks in the drumskin making it tighter than normal. When the drumskin tightens, it doesn't work the same and it makes sounds seem dull. </p>
<p>When something opens that tunnel, like when you get over your sickness or you pop your ears, air comes back to the room. The air can come back in slowly, so you barely notice, or it can rush in and make a &quot;pop&quot;. </p>
<p>The returning air relieves the drumskin and makes it easier to hear. If the problem with the tunnel isn't quite fixed, the vacuum and the &quot;pop&quot; might happen over and over until everything is fixed. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus ELI-an-adult-redditor:</strong> The eustachian tube (ET), which ventilates the middle ear space, may fail to function for a multitude of reasons. Often it's congestion of some type that temporarily blocks it or causes inflammation which impairs its function. Some individuals simply have dysfunctioning ETs and have chronic trouble equalizing middle ear pressure. In normal conditions, the ET opens frequently throughout the day before any significant pressure can build in the middle ear space. For this reason you don't really notice a change occur. When pressure has been allowed to change over time (e.g. in cases of cold or congestion) or pressure has changed suddenly (e.g. upon take-off or landing in an aircraft), a sudden opening of the ET is much more apparent and you get the classic &quot;pop&quot;. If your congestion is ongoing, you get these prolonged periods of negative middle ear pressure with only brief moments of relief. </p>
<p>Middle ear immittance is a story for a different day. The short end of it as it relates to this thread is that the negative middle ear pressure sucks in the tympanic membrane (TM; ear drum), changing its frequency response and reducing its ability to transduce acoustic energy (sound). As the ET opens, pressure within the middle ear approaches that of the surrounding atmosphere, which is typically ideal for normal transduction of sound. </p>
<p>EDIT: <strong>Source:</strong> I'm a pediatric audiologist, so I've spelled this out a few times in the past. To everyone asking for one form of advice or another...If something is impacting your daily life, it may be worth your time to have a quick exam by an ENT. Might help, might not. But you will have checked off something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pop is from a tube which runs from inside your ear to your nasal cavity.  You hear a pop when blockage is cleared and air pressure which has built up from breathing gets relieved.  It's called a eustachian tube. If you have constant mucus in there from sinus issues it can block the tube and everything will sound dull compared to normal hearing because the built up pressure prevents your ear drum from moving enough to transmit sounds. You can try to fix the sinus trouble or they make stints which hold this tube open if its a non-mucus related problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
