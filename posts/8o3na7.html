		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Andrew K. Dickerson, Peter G. Shankles, and David L. Hu of Georgia Tech among others have done a few preliminary papers taking high speed video of mosquitoes and other insects being hit by droplets of water.  </p>
<p>The basic findings are that sufficiently small raindrops will bounce off, larger ones that hit off center can rotate the insect in air, and larger ones making &quot;direct hits&quot; can cause the insect to drop, but even then quick recovery is possible.  The mosquitoes studied appear to survive the impacts well due to their &quot;strong exoskeleton and low mass... [causing] raindrops to lose little momentum upon impact and so [imparting] correspondingly low forces to the mosquitoes&quot;.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/75w44z/eli5how_do_small_animals_not_get_hurt_by_rain/do9i4x6/" target="_blank">My answer from when a similar question as asked in October 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The short answer is that rain is not really much of a problem for insects.  It's fog that is the bigger problem.</p>
<p>Here's my old comment in full:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of talk of arthropods and such, with some good references, but that's kind of missing several important factors.  It's easy to intuitively think of raindrops hitting small organisms as being equivalent to cinder blocks falling from the sky and hitting us, but that's not how it plays out.</p>
<p><a href="http://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2013/09/10/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall/" target="_blank">Raindrops are not moving very fast, nor are they heavy</a>.  For a raindrop to be considered a raindrop it has to be between roughly .5mm - 6mm (about the size of a fly at the largest).  A big raindrop has a terminal velocity of about 10 m/s (20 mph), with smaller drops down closer to 0.9 m/s (2 mph).  That's basically to say that there isn't much energy in any given raindrop to do a lot of damage with.</p>
<p>Another part is that smaller creatures are quite strong and tough as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">Square-cube Law</a>.  This is why an ant or a spider is proportionally so strong and an element of this is why a mouse generally won't fall fast enough to get seriously injured whereas a horse or an elephant will splash from a long fall.  Also why a raindrop falling on a shrew or a butterfly isn't the equivalent of a cinder-block falling on a human.</p>
<p>Raindrops can certainly hinder small organisms, but that tends to be more an issue of surface tension, heat loss, splashing and water flow, and things like that rather than the actual impact of the water droplet.</p>
<p>For many flying organisms <em>fog</em> (and, to a certain degree, drizzle) is actually  much more difficult thing to deal with as the tiny water droplets are suspended in the air and they accumulate on the surface of the flying organism, adding a lot of weight.  This is why you usually don't get mosquitoes buzzing about when it's foggy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>And before anyone says the mouse/elephant thing is taken from a youtube video, it's not.  It's from &quot;<em><a href="https://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.pdf" target="_blank">On Being the Right Size</a></em>,‚Äù by J.B.S. Haldane published in 1926.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mosquito's hate rain and wind and will not go out in either. pro tip on keeping mosquitos off of you on your porch/patio/deck, get an oscillating fan and have it blow across you and another to cove the area that the first fan misses that way they just barely over lap and the wind from each repels the mosquito's from the wind current which they struggle with and end up moving to other areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I was manipulating the entrance reducer, when I saw a bee coming back, fully loaded with pollen, get NAILED by a drop. It was hilarious- Both pollen packets went flying, and she got bounced on the bottom board. She sort of stood still for a second, then walked inside.</p>
<p>Cool story bro.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
