		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what you mean.</p>
<p>The machines that make up the Internet are all owned by independent entities.  Nobody manages the whole thing.  Each network decides on their own if they want to connect with other networks (and how), and as long as there's some route between two different hosts, they can talk to each other.</p>
<p>The protocols are largely managed by the IETF.  The protocols are the &quot;languages&quot; by which computers on the Internet can talk to each other.</p>
<p>The name system is ultimately organized by ICANN.  If you want to get or resolve a domain name, like reddit.com, you're interacting with systems ultimately governed by them.  ICANN also maintains the IP address space and a number of other components that are involved with unique identifiers on the Internet.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, there isn't really a central Internet authority or anything like it.  It's a cooperative endeavor among a lot of different groups of people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are answering the first part of your question and ignoring the second, so I'll try to tackle the &quot;How does it work&quot; part.</p>
<p>The internet is a complex beast, but at its core, it is just two computers talking to each other.  When you surf the web, as you go from one website to the next, you are just switching which computer you are talking to out there.  There is a lot of complexity that controls how you find these computers and how the routes are setup, but once you find who you are looking for, its just you and one other computer (and a bunch of routers/switches) moving your messages back and forth.</p>
<p>So, how does your computer find the other computer in this huge network of computers?  Lets compare this to something similar like mailing a letter.  Every computer/phone or other device hooked up to the internet has an IP address (ex: <a href="https://192.168.0.1" target="_blank">192.168.0.1</a>) just like every house/business has a street address.  If you want to talk to another computer, you need to know their IP address, just like if you mail a letter you need to know the street address of where you want it to go. </p>
<p>But wait, I don't know reddit's IP address, how am I talking to this website?  Something called DNS (Domain Name System) helps with that.  Basically there is a server (many actually) that is responsible for holding a database of website names correlated to an IP address.  Your computer asks them for help when looking for a website.  Think of it like looking somebody up in the phone book to find their address.</p>
<p>Okay so I have the IP address, now what?  The internet is not just a bunch of personal computers and servers, there are also things called routers on it.  You probably have one in your house.  As their name might imply, they help to route internet packets to the right location.  Think of them like your local post office.  They may see some addresses and say &quot;Oh that's a local address, put it on tomorrows mail truck&quot; or &quot;Oh this address is in a different country, send it to our central shipping hub!&quot;  In a similar way, your router (and all others on the internet) will help distribute traffic either to other local computers on the same network, or up to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) so that they (just more routers really) can send it to the appropriate location.</p>
<p>IP addresses are setup in such a way that it is easy to divvy them up.  This helps with the routing.  So for example, one ISP might own addresses from 1-500 and another might own 501-1000.  When you purchase internet service from them, they might give you address 45 to use.  If you are a business, you might get a range, like 350-400.  So if you are address 45 and you want to talk to address 547, the first ISP knows it needs to send the message to the second ISP because they own that address and they will know who they sold it to.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a gross simplification of the process, but this explains the gist of how two computers find each other on the internet and start talking to each other.  Keep in mind everything I wrote here usually happens in less than a second and current estimates suggest that over 24,000 Gigabytes of data are sent over the internet <strong>per second</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one, really.</p>
<p>The internet is just a bunch of private computer networks linked together.</p>
<p>ISP's run networks more or less specializing in connecting all the networks managed by individuals and organizations together, but they don't &quot;manage the internet&quot; in any meaningful way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot fo the Internat is made up of standards that everyone agrees to follow and be compatible with. Many of these originated from so called RFC where the public could comment on the proposals. Some organizations maintain those standards and a few organization actively manage resources associated with the internet that need to be managed centrally.</p>
<p>ICANN among other things manages domain names and IP addresses and how they are distributed to the various organizational companies who manage and distribute them.</p>
<p>The W3C maintains a number of standards associated with the Web.</p>
<p>There isn't really much management being done beyond that especially not content wise. Some countries like China have started actively trying to manage and police some small part of the internet with some success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is no one.  There isn't a CEO or president of the Internet.  The Internet is formed of multiple networks…that all conform to the  standard protocols…of the Internet known as TCPIP.…Some of these  networks are owned by private companies,…like your internet service  provider, universities,…cell phone companies and others.…But all these  different networks need to have a way…to tell one from the other.…It's  like having a bunch of airports.…Each airport is run by a different  group of people.…You need to have a way to know that…if you're going  from airport A to airport C…       </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
