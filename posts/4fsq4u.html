I think we should try to agree that the answer is quite possibly unknown, but a range of theories can be used in order to explain the belly bounce. We just can't be certain on one specific  theory </p>
<p>The mystery of the belly bounce lives on</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“The honest answer is that no one knows with absolute certainty,” said Dr. Brad Sagura, a surgeon at University of Minnesota’s Amplatz Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>“There’s a cast network of nerve connections within the body, handling messages between the spinal cord, the brain and other structures,” Sagura said.</p>
<p>When you hit the peak of a roller coaster and start dropping so quickly, things inside start to shift around.</p>
<p>“The liver and spleen are relatively secured by suspensory ligaments,” Sagura said. “But the intestines themselves are relatively mobile. While your body is secured by your seat belt, the organs are free to move about by some extent. That contributes to the free-fall floating sensation that either calls us back for more, or has us running to get sick from nausea.”</p>
<p>The movement isn’t only the movement of the organs, it is also the movement of what’s inside the organs.</p>
<p>“The intestines, the stomach, they hold liquid,” Sagura said. “The bladder; the same thing. “It’s relatively fixed, but the fluid within those structures probably plays a role in that sudden drop.”</p>
<p>Sagura said there’s no long-term danger from your organs slightly shifting around. They go back to where they started. But the movement is enough for your nerves to notice that something’s happening, he said.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're feeling weightlessness. Your body falls faster than your organs, so they &quot;rise&quot; in your body. If you were to hold a water bottle up in the air, and move it down quickly, the water inside will go to the top until it stops moving. This is what it would feel like in space all the time. When you are in zero gravity, you are technically in a constant free-fall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
