<p>The gross and net result of it is that people who spent most of their natural lives riding iron bicycles over the rocky roadsteads of this parish get their personalities mixed up with the personalities of their bicycle as a result of the interchanging of the atoms of each of them and you would be surprised at the number of people in these parts who are nearly half people and half bicycles...when a man lets things go so far that he is more than half a bicycle, you will not see him so much because he spends a lot of his time leaning with one elbow on walls or standing propped by one foot at kerbstones.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closest any atom comes to another is when they have a covalent bond. A double bond is slightly closer than a single, a triple closer than a double. </p>
<p>There are other types of bonds, like hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds, where electrons are loosely shared, but the atoms are farther apart than you'd find in a covalent bond. </p>
<p>When I poke you in the face and your cheek squishes, I'm obviously touching you, but, our atoms are not &quot;touching&quot; they are reaching a point where the force pushing them together is less than the force they exert to push apart. </p>
<p>Think of this as if you had two magnets and you're trying to push them together, the same thing is happening on a microscopic (if you've got an electronic microscope) level. </p>
<p>You generally don't bond at a molecular level to things that you touch, but let's say that you lick a pole in the middle of winter. Your tongue gets stuck to the pole right? </p>
<p>The pole is covered in a layer of crystalline water, your tongue is covered in a layer of liquid water, when the two come into contact, the water on your tongue crystallizes and binds to the ice on the pole. Your tongue gets stuck as water on your tongue that was liquid is now ice and at a microscopic level the ice is inside thousands and thousands of tiny crevices on your tongue and the tiny amount of force needed to pull away adds up quickly. </p>
<p>There's also the theory that the coefficient of static friction is due to the small scale ionic(?) binding between two surfaces when they're in contact. Like static electricity holding a balloon to the wall, that same force is why it's mathematically more difficult to start moving the wooden crate across the cement floor of your garage than it is to keep moving it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a molecular perspective, if you and the mattress are relatively dry, there is a very sharp distinction between your body (cellular) molecules and the mattress's molecules. If you could visualize it, you would see a band of relatively empty space. Think of it like the separation between oil and vinegar in a basic Italian salad dressing.</p>
<p>Now it and you are wet, things get interesting because the water molecules can form temporary bonds between some other types of molecules called hydrogen bonds, so in this case, the sharp distinction becomes somewhat blurry. Your skin cells are mostly hydrophobic, so there would still be repulsion from the hydrophobic parts, but there are proteins and enough other things that can interact with the water to make things messy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get that things never &quot;touch&quot; due to electron clouds, molecular bonds and all that jazz, but is that gap measureable?  Can we see it with a powerful enough microscope?  Id love to see the gap between 2 metal plates, sorta touching, but not really.  </p>
<p>If you take two hunks of large nucleus atom, or a large molecule, and put them together, is there a big enough gap for a hydrogen atom to slip through?  Can photons traverse this gap?  </p>
<p>Dammit, I have more questions than answers now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
