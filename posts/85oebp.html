		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though it was limited to WW1, it's too funny not to mention: earlier solutions to this problem involved reinforcing the propellers with steel deflectors to ricochet bullets in (hopefully) harmless directions, then just shooting, in the hope that most bullets would make it through.  This saw success, even though bystanders were killed by ricochets at the first demonstration of this technology.</p>
<p>Earlier even than that, pilots would snipe at each other with handguns and rifles.  I've even read of a brick being thrown.</p>
<p>Earlier even than that, to even fly was so novel that there was a collegial atmosphere in the air.  Planes were used for reconnaissance, and pilots would exchange friendly waves.</p>
<p>Earlier even than that, we hadn't invented planes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when you hold the trigger the gun doesnt fire until a little dingaling on the rotor blade shaft (inbetween two rotors in the empty space) hits a whatchamacallit, but since the blade spins so fast your dont really notice a delay. therefore if the gun is mounted on top of the aircraft at 12:00 it only fires when the rotors are at 9:00 and 3:00. </p>
<p>Thats as eli5 as it gets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was more of an unknown in WW1, actually.  The guns were synchronized with the propellers, which aren't in some random location, but in a very predictable position based on position of some shafts.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of how it works. <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/weapons/guns/fokker-synchronizer.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/weapons/guns/fokker-synchronizer.jpg</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers given below are correct. Interrupter gears were used, and if they ever failed it wasn't a big deal, the pilot could glide to a safe landing (hopefully behind their own lines). Some alternative designs had the pilot or bombardier able to stand up in their seat and fire a gun mounted to the top wing, over the propellor arc, also useful as it could slide back and fire directly upwards, so one could fly underneath an enemy and shoot upwards into the plane above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
