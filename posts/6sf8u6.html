<p>Bottom line: it's a discriminator for applicants.</p>
<p>Like someone else said, they put you in a room, ask you questions, and get you to either confess (lie about what you previously filled out, which will drop you from the hiring process) or give them an excuse not to hire you, if you stick to your story.</p>
<p>Example: you pass all the preliminary screening, the PT test, the interview, etc. now comes the poly. There's just something about you they don't like, but they can't find a tangible excuse to not hire you. So they give you the poly and then say your results came back &quot;inconclusive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look, we're not saying you lied, just the results were, 'inconclusive'.&quot;</p>
<p>This is typical at smaller depts with maybe only one opening and 15 applicants.  They may think you look too young, or too old, or too white, or too female, but they can't <em>not</em> hire you for that. The poly gives the dept an out.</p>
<p>Obligatory &quot;this blew up&quot; edit:</p>
<p>I'll try to get to everyone. I believe if you took the time to respond to me, I can take the time to respond to you. I'll do my best.</p>
<p>Just some quick answers:</p>
<p>LEO = law enforcement officer</p>
<p>Why do depts even do this and not just be &quot;straight shooters&quot; to applicants? .... I dunno, small town police depts are seeping in small town politics and probably don't want the drama. Or are saving money by avoiding a law suit... for another law suit. </p>
<p>&quot;Too white&quot; ... congratulations to the 50% of you who got the joke.</p>
<p>My experience is in Small Town, USA. A few commenters are letting me know they're outside the US. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an intimidation tactic. </p>
<p>I made it through the LAPD hiring process, but didn't accept the offer. The lie detector was a big part of it. They use it to get you to admit things you wouldn't admit. </p>
<p>&quot;You said you didn't do the thing.&quot;
&quot;I didn't&quot;
&quot;This says you did.&quot;
&quot;I did&quot;
&quot;You lied.&quot;</p>
<p>If you stick to your answers, you'll be fine. When I was going through the process, I had never, ever touched drugs, not even pot (today is a different story). They insisted I was lying about my drug use, which I knew full well I wasn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as someone who researched and built these devices for a job... simply because they are bullshit and most the only reason they &quot;work&quot; at all is that most people think they do, thereby getting anxious.   They aren't lie detectors at all, they measure acute changes in your &quot;anxiety&quot; levels.  These can easily be faked during true statements, and you can meditate or relax on false statements and it will throw the devices off.   </p>
<p>Bottom line, they are bullshit, but most people don't realize this and even if they do they aren't trained enough to evoke the same reactions (some of which are part of the autonomous nervous system, which isn't directly controllable consciously or at least with out practice) by will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work Internal Affairs and part of that deals with hiring public safety applicants.  My department won't disqualify anyone for failing the polygraph alone. </p>
<p>Generally speaking I think being told you're getting a polygraph tends to make people get a little more honest with their answers during my interview.  I don't do the polygraph myself,  that's all handled via independent contractors that have no motivation to my knowledge to even attempt to fail a person without cause. </p>
<p>My department is very understanding that people have a past, have chosen to experiment with drugs and occasionally have even been arrested and still get jobs. The key is being honest. If you're lying now,  odds are you will be lying later. </p>
<p>That lying thing continues to be a major thing during your employment.  Speaking from my experience, nothing makes internal affairs investigators more motivated to nail an employee to the wall than lying or being corrupt in general. I take it very personal when someone brings discredit to themselves and to the department I've chosen to represent. </p>
<p>Just my two cents on the matter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I saw others mention it is used as a way to get you to talk  or as way to not hire you if they don't like you. Which is possible, but there is also the fact that it is a buffer. People who are questionable might not even apply if they think skeletons from their closet might come out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
