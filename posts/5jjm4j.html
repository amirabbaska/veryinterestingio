		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting" target="_blank">evidence</a> that humans were a terrifying type of hunter known as Pursuit Predators. Basically, we picked an animal that we wanted to eat, and we followed it until it died of exhaustion. While other predators have sharp teeth or claws, or can reach much higher speeds, or can climb or whatever, humans are the top animals in regards to endurance. We simply keep going when other animals will need to rest. We find them, through tracks in the mud or hair left behind, and we tried to grab them. If they escaped, we would follow, over and over for hours or days until the creature (from a lack of food, water, rest, or overheating (humans sweat in a very efficient manner)) collapsed and either died or was bludgeoned to death with rocks.</p>
<p>This method could predate even the most basic of tools, so there's no need for a spear or a dart or a slingshot. We just simply followed an animal until it died, then we ate it. Humans are badass Terminator-type monsters, terrifying the animal kingdom with our intelligence and ability to just keep going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're equipped to track and kill food over very long distances. Our eyesight is detailed enough at range to pick out a moving target, and has binocular depth perception to assist in closing the deal at close range. Our minds are advanced enough to learn target behavior, pathfind over rough or twisting terrain, and build weaponry more capable than our natural defenses. Our bodies are configured for long range, low speed pursuit; there are several animals that can outrun us, but just about nothing can outwalk us, and our endurance is virtually unparalleled among land animals. </p>
<p>Putting it all together, a human can spot prey and begin following. The animal naturally makes a run for it, but the human knows how to identify the path the animal took. Eventually the animal's endurance starts to flag, and the human closes the distance and scores the kill, either by using a ranged weapon or a melee wepon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
