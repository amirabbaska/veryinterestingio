When a sound spreads, air itself isn't really moving in any direction, as opposed to wind, which is a displacement of an air mass. So sound is a wave of pressure variations, and air is a medium. When wind blows, the whole medium is moving, <del>waves</del> ripples can still travel through it. Think of waves on the surface of a flowing river : they can spread in any direction, regardless of the flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A breeze is very loud, just at a frequency outside of our range of hearing.  A breeze is very close to steady state (0 oscillations per second, or Hertz, Hz).  Human hearing starts somewhere around 50Hz. </p>
<p>If the breeze were gust on and off 50 times per second (50 Hz), then you would hear it as a loud low rumble.  This actually happens in some places where natural or man-made features cause the wind to resonate, but it is unlikely that a stray breeze would oscillate that rapidly.  </p>
<p>The second part is that humans are more sensitive to some frequencies than others.  Our hearing peaks in a range from 200-2000 Hz.  If you have two sounds of equal loudness but different frequencies, a person will hear them as being of different relative loudness.  </p>
<p>So even if you have a breeze oscillating at 50 Hz with lots of energy, it would not necessarily seem very loud to people nearby.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here are missing a huge point.</p>
<p>If you've ever recorded outside, you'll know wind is actually pretty loud but our PERCEPTION of it isn't. The oscillations are slow, so the pitch is very low.</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/iHpKJx" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/images/iHpKJx</a></p>
<p>This is a graph of human perception of the loudness of a frequency vs. the actual decibels of that frequency needed in order to sound the same to us. It requires soooo much more energy in that lower range to sound loud than in that middle range where human speech lives (keep in mind, every six decibels is twice as loud). Microphones have a flatter frequency response and will often go into the red from a little wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the simplest level, sound is just vibration. When we speak our vocal chords oscillate many times per second. This creates a pressure wave that propagates through the air and is received by the ear, which translates the mechanical vibration into electrical impulses sent to the brain. Wind is a bulk flow, not an oscillation. Wind does not move because of wave physics, but rather because of an air pressure difference in the local area. Instead of making your ear drum move back and forth, wind just pushes on it constantly in one direction. Simply put, wind is not a wave, thus it is not sound.</p>
<p>Hearing the wind “howl” is actually due to something else called vortex shedding. This involves turbulence created by obstacles in the wind’s path. (E.g. telephone wires)</p>
<p>Electricity Analogy: Sound is AC and wind is DC</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
