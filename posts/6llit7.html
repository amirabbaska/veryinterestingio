		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you do have a dimmer switch and it allows some amount of current through in the off position (might be defective/damaged/not quite pushed all the way off) then it could be producing the interference.  Most dimmer switches work by very rapidly flickering the power going to the light.  Current running through a wire produces a magnetic field, an amplitude fluctuated (flicking the power on and off very quickly) magnetic field is an AM (amplitude modulation) radio signal, thus when the dimmer rhythmically interrupts the current it produces a weak AM radio signal.  The reason the interference would clear up when you turn the light fully on is that the current is no longer fluctuating, the magnetic field is steady, and so it no longer interacts noticably with the radio.  Credit to <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/dimmer-switch.htm" target="_blank">http://home.howstuffworks.com/dimmer-switch.htm</a> for filling me in on dimmer switches.</p>
<p>I can imagine a defective or damaged regular switch creating the same power flickering effect in the off position, never providing enough continuous current to cause the bulb to heat up enough to glow, though I'm not sure how specifically that might happen.</p>
<p>tldr: a bad or broken dimmer switch can turn your wiring into an AM radio transmitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a long shot, since we know nearly nothing about your wiring.<br />
Every conductor carrying a voltage is an antenna.  So is the wiring in your house.<br />
The length of the antenna has to be adapted to the wave length (and therefore the frequency) of your signal.  E.g. a 100Mhz signal has a wave length of 3 meters.  ( Wavelength = speed of light / frequency ).  Antenna length like 1/2 wavelength, 1/4 wavelength also work well.<br />
.<br />
My guess is that the length of a wire in your house matches to the wavelength of your am radio. The wire is a weak antenna, but it's close to your radio, so it can distort the signal enough to create interference.<br />
As soon as you turn on the light the switch closes and increases the &quot;length&quot; of the wire, increasing the length of the antenna.  The interfering signal cannot be transmitted well be this &quot;new&quot; antenna -&gt; the interference is gone</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All wires act as antenna. When those wires pick up a signal that you want, it's a good antenna. When they pick up signals you don't want it's a bad antenna.</p>
<p>{And when wires are run near each other then they act as transformers, which is, for the purposes of this discussion a kind of antenna as well, except it picks up power.}</p>
<p>Most of the time we don't notice this antenna effect because our equipment has been designed and built with these effects taken into account. A good radio appliance will filter the power <em>and</em> the ground and do its best to isolate the receiver and amplifier circuits from the power lead effects.</p>
<p>It appears your radio... not so much on the filtering.</p>
<p>Others have mentioned crappy dimmers.</p>
<p>But in truth a wire connected at one end and not at the other is very much what most antenna are. Further long wire that is disconnected at one end, connected to ground at the other, and connected to a radio receiver right next to where it's connected to ground, is a very good antenna indeed.</p>
<p>So if the ground in your house is less than optimal, and your radio doesn't have good power lead filtering, and your light is off, and your radio and light are very close to one another electrically (like on the same trunk of the ground and maybe the same electrical breaker, which is highly likely) then when your light is on the closed and energized loop of current is a bad antenna. But when the light is off, the long lead up the ground, through the light, and back to the switch is a pretty good antenna.</p>
<p>If there are crappy things generating electrical noise in your house, like &quot;electrostatic air purifiers&quot; or old televisions, or dirty motors in old refrigerators... or if there are high energy things near your house, like weather and local industry, the effect will be amplified.</p>
<p>As an experiment I'd suggest getting a cheap surge suppressor/filter (e.g. like a computer &quot;power strip&quot;) for the radio to see if that cuts the noise.</p>
<p>There's an entire topic about &quot;transmission line effects&quot; that people make their career specialization in electronics. It's full of this sort of thing, and how to stop minimize this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The exact cause in your exact case can not be told with certainty from the information you've provided. But chances are it's just &quot;hey this long wire that doesn't go anywhere right now when the light is off is a bonus antenna that my cheap radio doesn't know how to cope with.&quot; And a cheap surge suppressor might be enough to fix it.</p>
<p>Worst case you've got a bad/corrupted/crappy ground in your house and you are far away from the neutral on the power pole, so fixing your situation would require getting an electrician to come in and wire a ground spike or three (the dryer your climate the more/longer the spikes needed) into your wiring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
