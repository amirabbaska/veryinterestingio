		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question, and for once, a neuroscience question with an answer.</p>
<p>So what you're calling the &quot;low serotonin&quot; model is usually called &quot;The monoamine theory of depression&quot;. With monoamines being the neurotransmitters Serotonin, Dopamine and noradrenaline/adrenaline.</p>
<p>What started the idea was a group of findings all being made at about the same time. The principle one was the finding that the drug Reserpine, which was being used to treat high blood pressure, cause rapid onset, severe depression [1]. Reserpine was found to basically completely deplete the brain of monoamine neurotransmitters. Importantly, soon afterwards, it was realized that by dosing people with 5-HTP and L-DOPA, compounds which help replenish the monoamine neurotransmitters, the depression induced by reserpine could be reversed [2]. People were also wondering about serotonin at the time, as LSD was still of scientific interest (and hadn't got much illicit interest yet) and it was known to interact with serotonin receptors. So the simple thought was &quot;If LSD makes you think funny and is to do with serotonin, and depression makes you think funny, could that be to do with serotonin too?&quot;[3]. So basically, the monoamine hypothesis was born.</p>
<p>Things really started to heat up for this hypothesis when the first antidepressant was discovered. Iproniazid was a drug being used to treat tuberculosis, and it was found that patients who were being treated also reported an improved mood. Researchers later found the Iproniazid blocked an enzyme called MAO, which is responsible for breaking down the monoamine neurotransmitters. People were messing about with drugs like crazy at this point, and a drug called  Imipramine , which was initially made to be an antihistamine, was then chucked at people with schizophrenia (because the first antipsychotic had been discovered). It didn't work, but it led to a doctor trying it on someone with depression, which did work. Imipramine was then declared to be the second antidepressant. Initially, this was bad news for the monoamine hypothesis, as imipramine didn't interact with any monoamine receptors, or MAO. But it was soon discovered that it blocked the uptake of noradrenaline and hence should increase the amount of noradrenaline floating around the brain.</p>
<p>So, at this point you should be thinking: this is all looking pretty good for the monoamine hypothesis, and indeed it was. But you should also note something, none of these findings are saying that depression is caused by low monoamines, just that increasing monoamines might cure depression. Antibiotics cure infections, but no one suggests that infections are caused by low antibiotics.</p>
<p>And then this paper came out [4]. What they showed was the paper claimed to show was that people with low serotonin (as measured by the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA) were more likely to die from suicide. However, their entire sample is people who ATTEMPTED suicide. Quote &quot; Two of the 20 patients in the low mode, and none of the 48 patients in the high mode died from suicide. &quot; Their whole conclusion is based on two out of 68 patients. They show no relationship between 5-HIAA and depression severity. But it didn't matter, this paper has been cited nearly 2000 times, and continues to be used as evidence for the monoamine hypothesis.</p>
<p>Why does the monoamine hypothesis continue to be used? Well, as you can see, there IS good evidence for it. Probably better evidence for it than any other hypothesis. There are real drugs that ... give or take... work. You could be cynical and say &quot;drug companies are pushing it&quot;, and there is probably some truth to that, but on the other hand, it's not like there is a great alternative theory.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a tonne of research into other neurotransmitter systems... Neurotropins, metabotropic glutamate receptors, as well as in completely other directions: neuroendocrine, gastro, genetic.</p>
<p>As a neuroscientists all I can say is we're trying out best.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The low serotinin idea comes from paradoxical outcomes of modulating other &quot;mood&quot; neurotransmitters, and the venn-diagram created by analysing the the cross-talk of the signalling of those neurotransmitters with the serotonergic system. It's also seen in SOME models of depression that the serotonin receptor is down-regulated (so not low serotonin, but low amounts of its target; there are also situations where there is excess seretonin receptor so intepret that how you will). Furthermore there are the links of depression with mutations in the serotonin receptor that effect its expression or ability to respond to seretonin (although this actually applies to a number of &quot;mood&quot; receptors); however this itself is not good evidence to target the serotinergic system in depression in this case as it implies even a drug targeting serotinin receptors, or serotinin re-uptake, is trying to activate an inefficient/broken system. All of this is a far from perfect solution, however, evidenced by equally conflicting outcomes when trying to directly alter mood by activating or inactivating serotinin receptors (rather than modulating serotinin's re-uptake, and hence ability to act at its receptors). Essentially all drugs are dirty and hit multiple things, and once you get in the brain it only gets worse. So an SSRI, for example, will often have other effects on other neurotransmitters or their receptors (despite the &quot;selective&quot; in their name), which may equally modulate mood.
To be clear though, SSRIs are not the current focus of depression targets, they are a relic of an earlier idea of anti-depressive medications (for the 1980s), which go through 10+ years of trials, followed by years in the clinic before we have a true idea of widespread effectiveness. The determination that serotinin clearly had an important role in depression led to a drive to find compounds that are more and more selective to inhibit serotonin re-uptake, however this hasn't panned out in the clinic (more selective SSRIs, don't make better depression drugs). So research is now focusing back on drugs that aren't as selective and will also involve other mood-modulating neurotransmitters and hormones.</p>
<p>TL;DR: SSRIs were the best idea (and a pretty good one compared to other early efforts) in the 1980s - hence now enjoy widespread use. However, newer efforts in the field (that haven't taken off as much, yet) don't just target the serotonin system and will also involve other mood targets (dopaminergics, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, cannabinoids, maybe GABA etc, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
