		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of shelf space allocated to products changes as seasons change.  It's hard to sell a hearty chili in the hot summer, but cold winter dinners feature it.  The store is also trying to conserve some ideas, like ketchup is next to mustard, that help shoppers find things.  Since the pattern of the shelves themselves is fixed, these two ideas are incompatible.</p>
<p>Since something has to move, the store is using A/B testing to figure out what pattern of stuff produces the greatest sales profits.  That's why it's a long walk to the milk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<p>One, venders will pay the store to have certain items placed in high traffic, high visible areas.</p>
<p>Two, availability of products. If there are certain seasonal items that sell, they will get priority where they are placed. As well as new products coming in, or older products not selling as well, so they are moved. </p>
<p>Market research. Stores have marketing people that will send them notifications that certain products will sell better if near area A or B. So the stores will relocate the product.</p>
<p>Sometimes its just a matter of space. The store will realize that they sell a lot more of this, so then they have to make room for it. And other products get bumped and shifted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a grocery store that has super low back stock, and ideally stuff would come off the truck and go onto the shelves.
It doesn’t quite work out that way but we’re constantly moving stuff around to minimize our back stock.</p>
<p>So produce is constantly shifted around to keep our back stock as low as possible, and because we specialize in seasonal produce, that section is reorganized every morning based on what we get in/what is available.</p>
<p>Our buyers also like to take advantage of deals so sometimes well get a plus out of some special one time item and so we move stuff around to accommodate these items all the time.</p>
<p>Also, we like to change our grocery end caps and register caps to reflect whatever season/holiday is coming to take advantage of those sales.</p>
<p>And all the time this stuff is moving around, we’re looking at what products we can put next to other products in a way that might yield opportunity buys that we may not get otherwise.</p>
<p>So the short answer is we’re trying to minimize back stock and keep the place updated not only to maximize sales, but for other, more practical, reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The employees are supposed to follow a schematic that only changes occasionally except for minor salrs changes.</p>
<p>The employees are undertrained, ordering products is a nightmare and the order sheet doesn't match the schematic so the consistently mis-order items. This causes gaps in the schematic. Gaps which need to be filled so that their department looks good so the employees just throw whatever product they have on hand in. </p>
<p>The prices change weekly but the store is understaffed to keep the shareholders happy. This results in a disorganized department where the prices dont match the product and the product isn't where it is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Source: was just hired from outside the industry to clean up a department as manager and these are my observations. Wish me luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
