		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A pimple is an infection. Bacterial infections begin with a bacterial pathogen and an inflammatory response to the pathogen. For pimples, anaerobic bacteria colonize a hair follicle and consume the sebum produced by sebaceous glands. This forms lipid byproducts which irritate the surrounding area. This inflammatory reaction recruits immune cells called neutrophils (a type of WBC). Neutrophils come in and dump bleach on the bacteria. As neutrophils die, they accumulate and form what we call pus or the “white stuff”. It only has one immediate way out; through the hair follicle to the skin surface. That’s why it exits that way. </p>
<p>Edit: correction about sebaceous glands (not sweat glands)</p>
<p>Edit2: I’m getting a lot of questions about the one way out. Added that exit to the skin surface is the only immediate way out. After a few days the pimple will resolve following absorption back into the body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pimples originate in hair follicles. For a normal pimple that's not inflamed (like a blackhead or painless whiteheads), it's generally a mix of keratin (from dead skin cells) and sebum (skin oil). Blackheads are open to the air, so the surface turns dark and the inside is often yellowish due to oxidation (it's not dirt). Whiteheads are covered by skin so the contents remain white. When a hair follicle becomes inflamed (red, swollen, and painful), often due to bacteria, the immune system goes to work, resulting in liquidy pus (made mostly of dead white cells). There are a couple other types of lesions that might be called pimples, such as epidermoid cysts (made of a little sac that fills itself with dead skin cells etc), pilar cysts (like epidermoid cysts but associated with a hair follicle), and steatocytomas (cysts filled mainly with oily sebum).</p>
<p>For more information, and for anyone who secretly (or not so secretly) likes watching pimples being popped, check out dermatologist Dr. Sandra Lee's YouTube channel, Dr. Pimple Popper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting post in which many of the answers here are not evidence-based. First, pimples are not an infection. The most potent approach to treating acne is oral isotretinoin, and this agent has no antimicrobial activity. Indeed, the role of bacteria (especially C. acnes) in acne is subject to some question. People posting on this site might choose to read something written recently (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29894579" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29894579" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29894579</a></a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Whereas there are some that form like on the side f your forehead and can lead to severe scarring while never forming a white head at all.
