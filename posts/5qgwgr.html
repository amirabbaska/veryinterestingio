		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason phone calls don't have perfect audio has all to do with three things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
<li>Physical medium of the delivery technology</li>
<li>The codec used</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all closely related.</p>
<p>If you think of a data connection as a water pipe, there is only so much data that can be passed down the connection, just like a water pipe can only carry so many gallons of water a second.</p>
<p>If you make the water pipe bigger, the pipe can carry more gallons a second and deliver more water faster to its source. This is broadly comparable to using better connectivity for our data connections. For example fibre optic cable can carry much more data a lot faster than the copper cables that are used to connect most of our homes.</p>
<p>To that end, when a phone conversation is initiated between two people, the sound of the voices from each party is in fact, a data connection that gets converted into an analogue frequency. Now uncompressed audio takes up a lot of space and can be slow to transfer, so to reduce it down to something more manageable, phone systems use something called a CODEC (en<em>CO</em>de/<em>DEC</em>ode) that basically analyses the audio, and throws out the bits of data that it thinks is not relevant to the clarity of the conversation. The more data it throws out, the more &quot;AM Radio&quot; the conversation sounds.</p>
<p>The standard codec used by most public telephone systems (Generally known as the &quot;PSTN&quot; to phone engineers or &quot;Public Switched Telephone Network&quot;) is something called U-LAW. Europe uses a variation of it called A-LAW. It allows 64Kbp/s of data for each way of the conversation (So 128Kbp/s total). It's been around since the 70's and is fairly embedded into most phone systems. It also closely matched and fitted the best data rate offered by twisted copper connections that where used at the time (And predominantly still are).</p>
<p>The days of the &quot;AM radio&quot; phone call are coming to an end though, if quite slowly.</p>
<p>Many new codecs have been developed alongside newer communications technology since the 70's that allow for greater clarity in a phone conversation. They do this by improved methods of packing in the audio data and more sophisticated ways of deciding what parts of the audio need to be thrown away and what needs to be kept. Some are even able to do this using a smaller transfer speed than the U-LAW codec. Most of these improved quality codecs are referred to as wideband codecs or &quot;HD audio&quot;. This has come about with the rise of a technology called VOIP or &quot;Voice Over IP&quot; which is basically a phone system that utilizes the same technology that underpins the internet (TCP/IP) to deliver an all digital phone service.</p>
<p>One of the most popular codecs used by internal phone systems of companies/organizations (Which is sometimes referred to as a PBX or Private Branch Exchange) is a codec called G722. The difference in audio quality between G722 and U-LAW is like night and day.</p>
<p>Cellular technology is also catching up on the wideband conversation game. Indeed many mobile carriers are offering wideband calls between users on the same network. This uses a codec called AMR-WB. It's generally predicted within ten years or so wideband audio for mobile phone calls will become the norm <strong>where supported</strong>.</p>
<p>I emphasise that &quot;Where supported&quot; bit because like most communication methods, a phone call has to negotiate down to the level of the lowest offering. So if a phone conversation is initiated between two phone systems, one side tries to use a wideband codec like G722 and the other side only supports U-LAW, then both phones will use U-LAW and the conversation will return to the &quot;AM Radio&quot; quality for both callers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The history of the telephone began with Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) which simply refers to the old, analog phone system we used for the first 100 or so years. Although humans (young ones anyways) can hear a range of frequencies between 20hz and 20,000hz, the vast majority of human speech is well below 4,000hz. The original designers of the POTS system designed what became known as a standard Voice Grade Channel (VGC) with practical limits due to the way electronic circuits worked so a standard VGC was typically 300hz to 3,400hz. When we switched to digital telephones they simply continued that standard by digitally sampling voice and consuming that same amount of bandwidth.  Fun fact. I worked with digital, encrypted telephones when I was in the Air Force and depending on the quality of the phone line and the bandwidth available, the encrypted phone would start at 4,000hz bandwidth and throttle to a smaller bandwidth if it couldn't maintain synchronization. At half that standard bandwidth or 2,000hz the quality of the speech reduced so you wouldn't recognize your own mom. At half again of that or 1,000hz you could barely understand it and could not recognize male from female speakers on the other end</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To save on bandwidth, many of the audio codec compresses in a lossy format to squeeze more active calls simultaneously. There are lots of phone in a given region, and there's never enough capacity to carry all the phones calling at the same time. </p>
<p>There's also the problem that if you don't have at least a bit of noise on the phone, people think it is not working, so even if you are in a quiet room calling another phone in a quiet room, you're likely to hear some white noise to help you differentiate between an active call with silence on the line vs a phone without an active call. </p>
<p>Most carriers in North America should have HD voice, which should improve voice quality. But it's definitely possible that if you make a call through a network that doesn't support it, the call falls back to the older standards. </p>
<p>In Hong Kong a couple of years ago, any calls to CMHK number would sound worse than other carriers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have <del>no</del> you not had an HD Voice (aka Wideband Audio) call? Most all carriers support it now, <del>by</del> but it's only if both parties have the same carrier and supported devices. T-Mobile even has a more advanced audio quality feature for a handful of phones.  </p>
<p>As for why normal calls are low quality, because that's what is decent enough to understand people, and improving that quality is way too expensive compared to implementing Wideband Audio which simply uses VoIP (the VoLTE setting on your phone).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also: it's got to be compatible with all phones on the network; theoretically your call might be digitised then turned analogue then digitised then turned analogue then digitised then sent analogue down a 100-year-old rusty copper line into a 50 year old handset.
