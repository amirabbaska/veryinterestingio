		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best info I've found on the subject, though there's not much in the way of citations in this one-paragraph column: ESPN Magazine (<a href="http://espn.go.com/magazine/vol4no06answerguy.html" target="_blank">http://espn.go.com/magazine/vol4no06answerguy.html</a>). The gist: there are records of awarding prizes to fighters as early as the 8th century BCE, including a two-handled cup (which sounds a lot like a modern trophy).</p>
<p>The first real &quot;modern&quot; belt appears to have been given to (or perhaps made by) John L. Sullivan (<a href="http://www.masisboxingbelts.com/johnlsullivan.htm" target="_blank">http://www.masisboxingbelts.com/johnlsullivan.htm</a>) in the 1880s when he wanted to cement his claim to being the world boxing champion. Why he went with a belt rather than a trophy isn't clear to me. The article's author speculates that the tradition of belts and boxing came from a practice of boxers wearing a belt or sash of their sponsors' colors, then taking the colors of the loser to wear as a sort of &quot;spoils of combat&quot; or something. The ornate trophy-belt would thus be the next logical step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory that the tradition of combat Sports recognising success and accomplishments with belts is based In Greek mythology, specifically the ninth labour or Hercules. For his ninth labour Eurystheus ordered Hercules to bring him the belt of Hippolyte, queen on the amozons, a tribe of warrior women. The belt had been given to Hippolyte by Ares, god of war and held her weapons. Hercules retrieved the belt after a hard won battle. And thus the taking of a belt from a vested opponent became how champions of combat Sports were honoured. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that nobody knows the origin of the belt as a prize, though itâ€™s been a thing in boxing for over 200 years. Other combat sports such as wrestling have copied the system from boxing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good luck getting that through the loops on your trousers.</p>
<p>It's a cummerbund, not a belt.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from what I've read, the cummerbund was originally a sash such as what miss world contestants wear to show their affiliation to teams etc.</p>
<p>The next step was to use the same means to show winnings and titles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
