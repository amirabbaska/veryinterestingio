		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC: Social security number was never actually intended to be a form of identification. The IRS just needed a number that could represent someone uniquely so they picked the social security number that was already there. The social security number I think was initially focused on depression era welfare and only expanded into identification territory because it was easier than tracking people by name.</p>
<p>CGP Gray has a pretty good explanation others have linked to.</p>
<p>/u/celticeejit made a comment that compares the social security number to a primary key in an relational database, which I thought was good but was criticised by someone else for being too programmer heavy.</p>
<p>Basically, when you have a lot of data about something in a list of things, you want a specific identifier to refer to that object. e.g if you have two John Smiths, how are you supposed to tell them apart? You could refer to specific unique features about John Smith, like age or hair color or what school they went to, but it's much easier to refer to both John Smith's as 1 and 2 then it is to refer to them as John Smith with the red hair or John Smith with the gray hair. Especially if one of them has a kid also named John Smith. It's generally good form not to have a bunch of little details to identify something, when you can use a single tag/key/serial code. Also you want a form of identification to remain static so that even if little details change, the object as a whole can still be understood. For instance if Greg decides he now wants to be called Marsha Brady and has surgery to reflect this, He or She would still have the same social security number no matter who they are now.</p>
<p>A primary key ensures that no matter how much info might be shared (or similar) by two objects, they can still be referred to individually in a database. E.g when you need to get your computer or phone replaced, your manufacturer could know which phone they are fixing, whose phone it is, and the warranty status based on the serial number, even if it looks like every other phone. That might not be the actual primary key in their database, but it's the serial number may be the code they use to keep track of the warranty and other details.</p>
<p>Social Security number (despite the fact that it's insecure) is basically used as a one sized fits all identifier, or &quot;primary key&quot; because there's not really any other identifier that could be universally used. Not everyone has a driver's license, and some people aren't old enough to have voting IDs, but they probably have a social security number if they're a citizen.</p>
<p>tl'dr Even though it shouldn't be, The social security number is basically a serial number for people.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a SSA provided page about how Social Security numbers are calculated.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very insecure SSN is a consequence of the US population (and politicians) resisting the efforts to create national IDs.</p>
<p>The SSN was originally intended for one purpose: tracking a workerâ€™s lifetime earnings in order to calculate retirement benefits after age 65. The SSA even added the disclaimer &quot;FOR SOCIAL SECURITY PURPOSES NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION&quot; to the card in 1946. </p>
<p>Many years ago the IRS allowed tax payer to declare how many dependents they had to earn a deductions. This was an honor system that obviously was abused. The INS then started to only accept dependents that had a SSN. </p>
<p>Parents then started to request SSN cards for children when they are born instead of when they started working (the original design). That increases the chances someone can [guess your SSN] (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/webhead/2009/07/no_you_cant_have_my_social_security_number.single.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/webhead/2009/07/no_you_cant_have_my_social_security_number.single.html</a>) based on your place and date of birth. </p>
<p>Without any other form of national ID and now with most (if not all) US citizens having a federal provided identification, SSN became the defacto standard ID. From there banks, creditors, health care providers, etc. all started tracking you by your SSN. </p>
<p>That's actually a VERY BAD thing because </p>
<p>1- The SSN card is just a piece of paper, not a proper ID
2- The system was never designed to contain so much private, financial and health data
3- By combining so many ID's, it create huge risks for everyone</p>
<p>The populace should just get over it national ID issue. This paranoia people have with the federal government tracking them is silly (people should learn about this obscure not well know agency called NSA). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Erp8IAUouus" target="_blank">CGP grey did a video on this.</a> I don't think there'll be a better ELI5 explanation. It's only 8 minutes, but I'll give you a summary anyways.</p>
<p>Basically, it's the <strong>only</strong> form of national ID we have, so nation-wide companies (such as credit companies) use it as the de-facto way of having a single way to identify citizens. Pretty much everyone that wanted a way to track US Citizens across multiple states now uses Social Security Numbers.</p>
<p>The problem is, there's absolutely <strong>zero</strong> security built into it. It was <em>never meant</em> to be a form of ID, so when it was created they didn't include any protections at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problem is: as lot of companies have really crummy security procedures. In some cases, they use the SSN like a pin or password. In other cases, they don't ask for any ID to prove you are you before taking out a loan, etc.</p>
