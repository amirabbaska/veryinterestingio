		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my knowledge, your muscles are made up of fibres (within in those fibers, myosin filaments) but when you lift something not all the fibres in one muscle contract at the same time it’s like a wave like movement- the more weight the more fibres join in. Until it gets to the point when you are at your max muscle capacity which in this point your muscle is trying to hold the weight by contracting out of place fibres (not following the wave like movement) which causes you to shake. So pretty much it’s caused by the irregular contractions of your muscle fibres because it’s too heavy.</p>
<p>Side note it’s not always the best for your muscles to reach that point </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctoral Physical Therapy Student/BS in Exercise Science:</p>
<p>Your control center (brain) sends a signal to your muscles to contract. One full contraction “cycle” (contract then relax) is microscopic. Doing something like a dumbbell curl involves MANY of these contractions. </p>
<p>When you hold your arm out to the side and keep it there (sustained contraction, no trembling) you are sending signals more quickly, and your control center has sent a new “contract” signal to those muscle fibers before they have an opportunity to “relax”. This is known as “fused tetanus”, a state in which the muscle remains at a relatively constant length. Smooth movement through any motion is the product of tetanus. </p>
<p>The “trembling” that you see when someone is lifting something heavy or has been working out for a long time is because the body is failing to move the weight. Chemical changes brought on by prolonged exercise (you’ve probably heard of “lactic acid”...slightly more complicated than that but that’s another discussion), central nervous system fatigue (your brain can’t coordinate the movement), and Peripheral Nervous System inhibition (special nerves in your muscles and tendons notice you’re lifting something heavy and send STOP signals to keep you from hurting yourself) all contribute to this failure in one way or another. When you hit that failure point, your body is unable to sustain “fused tetanus” and smooth movement through a given range of motion. Thus, you tremble! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As another poster said, your muscles contract in pulses, so when weights get heavy (relative to your normal) your muscles tremble, but this can also be caused by fatigue. If the fibers have contracted (or have been contracting) with sustained weight, when you reach a point that it can’t sustain it with that steady wave-like patterns anymore, the nerves in your muscles start firing between waves to squeeze a little bit more strength out of the muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you lift something, most people only notice the big muscles that are actually doing the work, like the quads in your thighs or the biceps in your arms. There are also a bunch of small muscles that lay alongside these big muscles that are called &quot;stabilizers&quot; they help to keep the main muscle in place so it can do all the work. If your stabilizer muscles are weak then your big working muscles have a lot harder time doing their job, causing them to wobble.</p>
<p>As an aside, stabilizer muscles are why a lot of weightlifters prefer to use barbells and dumbells for lifting. When you use a weight machine the stabilizer muscles don't get worked as well. Squats vs leg press are a good example, both work your quads and glutes, but squats force you to also use your core and stabilizer muscles, which is why people can usually put more weight on the leg press than they can squat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's studied physics, a follow on question: does the twitching have to do with impulse force? Think of trying to pull a massive object. A slow steadily increasing pressure can do it, but quick, jerking motions will impart the same impulse, nominally, over a shorter periods of time. </p>
<p>Basically, is this twitching an evolutionary mechanic to overcome fatigue?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
