<p>As an example, if a Quantum computer were asked to find the two prime factors of a number (like in decryption/encryption), how would the Quantum computer read the selection of Qubits to give the correct solution?</p>
<p>The only way I can think of this happening is to have a selection of logic gates that somehow collapse the Qubit into the correct state when observed; however, I'm not too sure how this actually would work with Qubits.</p>
<p>Any overview/condensed answers would be as much appreciated as those which go into a more atomic/chemical depth about how it would all physically function.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not entirely qualified to answer this, so please correct me if I'm wrong and I hope someone answers you more in depth.</p>
<p>You need to keep in mind that collapsing a quantum state is done with respect to a basis, but that doesn't mean that you create the  state out of nowhere, the system already is in a given state, which will be the result of whatever calculation/gates you've done, and that is the &quot;correct&quot; state, the task is solved through the interaction of quantum states, no collapsing involved! So what you need to do is read out the final state the system is at after all calculations have been done.</p>
<p>As to how that's done, it depends on the  system and what is used as qubits, there's spin qubits, qubits made of pollarized light etc.</p>
<p>Usually you just need to use the tools and measurements available to you in the experimental set-up  to try to find out information about the state of the system.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to using electrons spins as qubits,  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9701055.pdf" target="_blank">Loss &amp; Divicenzo</a> proposed getting the electrons into a quantum dot with a given set of magnetic properties so that it would be influenced by the electron spin, and then you would measure the magnetization of the whole dot. Similarly, you can measure the current that flows through the system which is usually heavily affected by the spin state of the electrons, or the charge distribution, and figure out what state the system must be in for that to happen.</p>
<p>So, generally from what I know, you don't just simply collapse the system by measuring it directly, you just create an experimental set-up where by measuring properties of the system, you can reverse engineer the quantum state it is in.</p>
<p>Again, the in depth explanation about how that's done would depend on what is being used as qubits, how the computer is designed etc, there's tons of papers that focus on understanding how different qubit states affect physical measurable properties of the systems just to help create different trustworthy read-out options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I too am not really qualified to answer, but I have some experience with atoms in optical cavities which is essentially qubits interacting which each other.</p>
<p>Reading out qubits is not really different from reading out normal bits but instad of 1 and 0, qubits contain a linear superposition a|0&gt; + b|1&gt; which essentially means, if you read out a bit with that state, you will read a &quot;0&quot; with a probability |a²| and a 1 with a probability |&quot;b²&quot;|</p>
<p>There's not more to it than that.</p>
<p>I don't know anything anything about quantum algorithms, but in general they will probably deliver a result with cubits in states that are 1|0&gt;  + 0|1&gt;  (or  0|0&gt;  + 1|1&gt; )
Which means you have a 100% probability of reading &quot;0&quot;  (or 1 for the case in brackets).</p>
<p>If for some reason a quantum algorithm results in a specific qubit superposition with specific a and b values, then to obtain those a an b values, you literally have to repeat your algorithm and use some statistics.
There are some complications with that because a and b are complex numbers. So you can know the magnitude but not the phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently, as quantum computers are now, the quantum chips in the computers are cooled down to temperatures about 0.015 Kelvin to minimize any quantum phenomenon that may happen during processing. The chip also uses Quantum entanglement to predict what certain outcomes will be despite the quantum superposition of the electrons used to process.
