		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me just start with stating that the top comment so far about stomach acidity is just blatantly incorrect. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So your body wants to get rid of some acid in order to get your blood acidity back to normal. And where's a great supply of acid? Your stomach, which is filled with hydrochloric acid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your stomach pH and your blood pH are not connected. Taking a Tums doesn't change your blood pH, so throwing up doesn't do anything for your blood acidity. Your body doesn't filter blood acidity by utilizing your stomach. Your stomach is for digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> So why are people nauseous after hard exercise? Basically, it's because your body is drawing blood away from your digestive organs. You're doing intense exercise, why do you need to be digesting dinner? Your body thinks, &quot;Hey, all this running is hard. Why are we carrying a sack of half-digested food? It's slowing us down. Let's get rid of it so we can run better.&quot; </p>
<p>All energy should be sent to helping you run, or push that weight up, etc. If you want to avoid throwing up during exercise, avoid eating a few hours before hand, or keep it light with gatorade/fluids. </p>

<p>Above is a good article about exercise induced vomitting. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> from it: &quot;Nausea and vomiting are relatively frequent GI symptoms in athletes, especially those performing endurance sport disciplines. In the majority of the cases they are particular physiological reactions to strenuous exercise and might be alleviated by proper hydration.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Another good excerpt from it:</strong> &quot;The sole accompanying symptom was nausea a few seconds before the vomiting occurred, without any other announcing signs and no following complaints. The patient reported that he consumed the last meal always at least 2 h prior to the exercise.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dislike the lactic acidosis hypothesis as vomiting won't change one's blood pH for a long time after the event therefore doesn't make sense as a way of ridding the body of acid acutely - that's what the increased ventilatory depth/rate and kidneys are for.</p>
<p>It is obviously a multifactorial thing but important aspects that haven't been mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical - running especially can throw the gut around in the abdomen a significant amount. If there is food or liquid in it the 'sloshing' makes this worse. This triggers stretch/mechanoreceptors in the gut wall which connect with the area postrema (vomit centre of the brain) causing nausea.</li>
<li>Sympathetic drive. Significant exercise of any type raises circulating catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline aka epinephrine) which can cause nausea and vomiting through receptors in the same area as described above.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about the light-headedness, weakness of muscles (can barely find the energy to sit, and would prefer to lie flat on the ground), and light-sensitivity that sometimes happens with the nausea? Is that a heart-attack or just part of the same thing as the nausea?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your Nervous system has a branch called the Autonomic Nervous System that controls a bunch of autonomic processes like blood pressure, secretions, etc. The ANS has two branches, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. These are your &quot;fight or flight&quot; and &quot;rest and digest&quot; (respectively) nervous systems. Your body runs as a balance of these two nervous systems and the balance is shifted depending on the scenario (like being chased by a bear)</p>
<p>So normally, your PNS, rest and digest, is in charge, and one of the things it controls is the digestive system. Digesting requires a lot of blood to circulate to the area and requires a lot of energy (ironically). This is something that happes while you &quot;rest and digest.&quot;</p>
<p>When you exercise your body treats it like you're being chased by a tiger, hence activating the Sympathetic nervous system  (SNS). When you're being chased by a tiger, you dont need to be spending energy digesting the burger you just ate but instead pumping those legs and thinking really hard to run away and deal with the situation. So, the SNS will override the PNS and contract certain blood vessels in the gut, stop the movements in the gut to push and churn the food (also called peristalsis), and break down fat, to spend its efforts on running away. However, the controls of the digestive system keep certain parts in their specific spaces (stomach contents in the stomach, etc). By the SNS overriding the gut control, the stomach cant contain its material. As a result, you end up letting it all out and barf. Its also why some people shit their pants. Some dont have this happen to them because the signals arent as strong in the gut, they can hold it down willingly, etc.</p>
<p>Source: TBH i dont have one but I'm a student in pharmacy school and this actually came up in our ANS lecture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
