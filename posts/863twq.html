		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time lurker but finally a question I can answer. (Source: am materials scientist who works on softness in industry).</p>
<p>Softness is a complex, multi-variable phenomena which we think involves two components: 1) the material a person touches and 2) the persons [somatosensory system] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system</a>), which is a combination of the nerves in your finger and neural system. Since the brains involved, things start to get complex. </p>
<p>Like the other commenters have mentioned, a simple reason for observing why a piece of cat hair is soft is linked to the fiber diameter. In fact, research has <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/004051756103100710" target="_blank">shown</a> that a small fiber diameter of a material class does link to a greater degree of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/app.23898" target="_blank">softness</a> . But pet your cat in one direction (toward the tail) and a different direction (away from the tail), and you might have a different experience. What this means is that by orienting the fibers in a different ways, you're body can register a difference sense of softness. </p>
<p>Taking it on step further, the micro and mezo-structures of the fiber also (things like kink, curl, or shape) play a part. Surface coatings, and blooming agents are readily sought in the synthetic fiber making world to enable softness at the fiber level. All different type of animal (and people for that matter) have different natural hairs which kink, lay straight or flat depending upon the way the hair is formed.</p>
<p>The macro structure of a fabric or group of hair matters too as there is active research ongoing to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781845691356500025" target="_blank">characterize</a> the behavior of fabrics and other composite materials like velvet. You can get into macro level properties like drape, compressive modulus, friction, and even the sound of fabric or hair, to get into a response that could be considered soft. </p>
<p>The other aspect (which I don't have good sources for other than data I've generated) is that what you put <em>behind</em> a material matters immensely. If you put your cat hair on top of brick, you are likely to not think its so soft versus against the cat's skin, since the skin bends easily. An analogy would be, take a piece of velvet and wrap it around a brick. That velvet brick will likely feel soft to the touch if you barely put pressure on the top of the fabric, but put a little more pressure, and it doesn't feel so great. </p>
<p>The reason I put &quot;we think&quot; at the top is because unfortunately the instruments used to measure softness are humans, so the variability in the data is very high. In fact, not having an &quot;anchor&quot; in a softness assessment almost always provides data that isn't repeatable from test to test (i.e. feather = 1, brick = 10). Further more, since the somatosensory system involves your brain, things like sounds, color, what you ate, how you feel that day, can skew data. We can find general trends in the data which point toward some general characteristics for softness directions (small smooth fibers, in a highly drapable and cushiony fabric), but within material groups, differences are hard to find. </p>
<p>Lastly, the aspect that really makes things difficult, and I find fascinating, is that across cultures, softness perception changes. I have seen two study groups from Japan/China and the US have completely opposite opinions of what &quot;cottony&quot; means. Even using a material that is considered soft in one culture, doesn't work in another because of how softness is defined in each.</p>
<p>TL;DR : It depends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would agree with funintheburbs comment, but add that it is not just the 'give' of the material as a whole that gives it that velvety feeling (for example, a sheet of cotton has a lot of give, but does not produce the same feeling as cat fur), but also the diameter and density of the fibers comprising the surface of that material. A material with a high density of narrow, flexible fibers will feel soft, like fur. The same material with less give would feel like toothbrush bristles. So it's really the fact that there are very many narrow and flexible fibers making contact with your skin all at once that produce a furry feeling when brushed against.</p>
<p>To go even deeper, the micro-structure of those fibers plays a role as well. If the micro-structure is rougher (nano-scale pits), the additional friction will make the material feel rougher.</p>
<p>Edit: I would actually modify my argument (per the_epic_narwhal's question regarding the smoothness of leather) to say that the most important factor is not the fibrous nature, but the surface microstructure. If the fibers are smooth, and you brush your hand against them, you are essentially pressing them into a uniform surface, so it would be similar to brush your hand against a well worn piece of leather or other material with few surface imperfections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are used to thinking of the senses in the very basic categories we learned in elementary school - sight, hearing, touch, smell, touch.  But what we experience is not raw sensory input, it is our brain’s interpretation of a variety of sources of information compiled together into a constructed perception of reality.</p>
<p>Touch is made up of a large number of individual systems and nerve types.  Mechanoreceptors respond at a basic level to pressure and stretching, and there are several types that are specialized for certain kinds of sensation (soft pressure, deep pressure, sustained pressure, vibration):  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor</a></p>
<p>Hair on our body serves to further enhance the variety of sensations we can perceive, as the mechanoreceptors attached to each respond to its complex movement.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are nerves for sensing temperature change, pain, the spatial position of our body and angles of our joints (proprioception), balance (inner ear hair cells), etc.</p>
<p><strong>So back to your question - what makes something feel soft or furry?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a sensory nerve type dedicated to furry things, or to wetness, or to the feeling of wind blowing.  Rather, these are all interpretations our brain deduces based on the compilation of sensory information (or lack thereof!) it is receiving from all of the nerve types above.  Brushing against something furry will incite a mixture of responses due to hair movement, light pressure, temperature change, etc, that fits the brain’s pattern for “fuzzy”.  Proprioception plays a role here too, as our brain uses the position of our body (the finger touching the cat) in its interpretation of the tactile senses coming from contact with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Friction. At a microscopic level, every surface looks very different. Your fingers/hands are pretty rough too. You feel something is &quot;soft&quot; when a material can slide around on your hand without tugging on it too much. Harder surfaces will give more resistance.</p>
<p>Fibers that are thicker and coarser like wool also are likely to feel rough to your hands in comparison to smaller and smoother fibers like silk.</p>
<p>Another factor is warmth. How insulating a material is can impact how it feels to you. Something made of metal will feel cold or hot to the touch depending on the temperature because heat flows readily between your hand and the surface. Something insulating like most animal hair fibers will not draw heat from you easily, making it feel warmer, which adds to your feeling of &quot;softness&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry in advance for not being good at inserting equations onto Reddit...  </p>
<p>When your hand comes into contact with something, it is slowed by the force of the object on your hand. If the collision between your hand takes more time, the amount of force applied to your hand is less. If the object has &quot;give,&quot; it will take time to deform, which increases the time of the collision between it and your hand, which decrease the amount of force it applies to you. If the object did not have as much give, the collision would take less time, which would mean a larger force acting on your hand.  </p>
<p>This can be summed up by the concept of impulse, which is also defined as the change in momentum (final momentum minus initial momentum), which is equal to the net force acting on the object multiplied by the time over which that force acts.  </p>
<p>The concept can also be approached through the common version of Newton's second law, net force equals mass times acceleration. The more rapid the acceleration of your hand during the collision with an object, the more force it will exert on your hand. Here, less give means less time, which means a greater acceleration, which means a greater net force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
