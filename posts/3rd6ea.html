	<title>ELI5: Probability and statistics. Apparently, if you test positive for a rare disease that only exists in 1 of 10,000 people, and the testing method is correct 99% of the time, you still only have a 1% chance of having the disease.</title>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was doing a readiness test for an Udacity course and I got this question that dumbfounded me. I'm an engineer and I thought I knew statistics and probability alright, but I asked a friend who did his Masters and he didn't get it either. Here's the original question: </p>
<p><em>Suppose that you're concerned you have a rare disease and you decide to get tested.</em></p>
<p><em>Suppose that the testing methods for the disease are correct 99% of the time, and that the disease is actually quite rare, occurring randomly in the general population in only one of every 10,000 people.</em></p>
<p><em>If your test results come back positive, what are the chances that you actually have the disease?
99%, 90%, 10%, 9%, 1%.</em></p>
<p>The response when you click 1%:
<em>Correct! Surprisingly the answer is less than a 1% chance that you have the disease even with a positive test.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the responses, looks like the question is referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_paradox" target="_blank">False Positive Paradox</a> </p>
<p>Edit 2: A friend and I thnk that the test is intentionally misleading to make the reader feel their knowledge of probability and statistics is worse than it really is. Conveniently, if you fail the readiness test they suggest two other courses you should take to prepare yourself for this one. Thus, the question is meant to bait you into spending more money. </p>
<p>/u/patrick_jmt posted a pretty sweet video he did on this problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2tNxIaGpR4" target="_blank">Bayes theorum</a></p></div></div>
