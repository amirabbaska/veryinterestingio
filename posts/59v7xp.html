<p>It basically states that humans developed consciousness with an intermediary step -- bicameralism.  This involved two parts of the brain communicating, one is talking to the other and telling it what to do.  The author states that this is where the concept of &quot;god&quot; came from, as early humans were literally hearing another voice giving them commands.  Over time this evolved into true consciousness with an internal dialogue.</p>
<p>Some of these themes are being addressed (via artificially-intelligent androids) in HBO's new series Westworld.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, this perspective comes from cognitive neuroscience of linguistics, so it's very speech-y. I've learned a few things about the psychology of consciousness, which I think could also be helpful, but not enough to make a point really.</p>
<p>Okay here's my best shot at this:</p>
<p>Overall, when you're producing speech or even just thinking about talking, you start very general and get more specific. First, you'll retrieve what you want to say conceptually. Then you pick the right words, then you start to attach the sounds of all the letters to those words along with tone and rhythm and syllable structure. Basically, until the later stages right before you're actually speaking, your &quot;voice&quot; doesn't have things like loudness and pitch and rhythm attached to it. So it makes sense that how you perceive these earlier stages when you actually focus on them could be variable. You don't have to engage all of the specific motor commands before when you're thinking of something to yourself. It's also worth noting that the areas of the brain involved in this process are also mildly involved in speech <em>perception</em> so maybe that would make it susceptible to influences from other speakers/dialects? That's iffy though, I'm just guessing.</p>
<p>ALSO</p>
<p>Everyone has some sort of Auditory-Verbal Short Term Memory. If someone tells you to memorize a phone number, a lot of people will sit there and say it over and over a few times. But you can also do that process without saying it out loud. When you're doing this, you create a loop in your speech production system, without actually ever telling your mouth to do anything. It just cycles through over and over so you can retrieve it when you need it. So again, this little &quot;voice&quot; is bouncing around in your head, but it maybe hasn't gotten to the levels that specify exactly <em>how</em> you're going to say something.</p>
<p>ALSO </p>
<p>In theories of speech production there's two different pathways that monitor the entire process. So basically you have two little &quot;speech quality control&quot; guys in your head. One is external. That one takes in the sound of your voice and &quot;listens&quot; to make sure everything came out right. Another is internal. Less is known about this process, but basically it's checking all the steps before anything comes out of your mouth. So when you think of a sentence to say in your head it's making sure that things are in the right place before you accidentally tell someone you have &quot;soap in your hole&quot; instead of &quot;hope in your soul.&quot;</p>
<p>The areas of the brain theoretically responsible for the internal guy also are activated when people are told to generate their own voices in their heads. Interestingly, these same areas are active when people with schizophrenia hear voices. </p>
<p>So what does this tell us? Probably that you all have schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Joking, it really just points to the idea that our internal quality control friend is a pretty active dude and works all the time. So there's a part of your brain that's continually cycling through things you could say, and maybe in people with schizophrenia this little dude is doing something wrong. </p>
