		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple reasons, some have already been mentioned in to comments, others haven't. Keep in mind that this is based on my experience working with this in Sweden. Mileage in other countries may vary. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Horses are less noisy and more approachable. People can come up and talk to the officer in a different way. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horse still offers mobility and speed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tradition and culture. In a lot of places, like Sweden (where I live) horses are fairly integrated in culture. People enjoy seeing horses out and about. Not everyone want to approach one, but that's fine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crowd control. You absolutely do not fuck with one of those horses. They're huge, and on their back you have a trained police officer. It's a force multiplier. I've seen sports events riot like situations where three mounted officers replaced 20-25 officers in riot gear. The fights stopped immediately and people scattered. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessibility. A mounted officer can move in areas where a car can technically move, but is advised not to because it could cause blockage or congestion. Such as walking streets or shop streets. </p>
</li>
<li>Visibility. A police forces primary task is to maintain law and order. This is preferably done by preemptive measure, with things as simple as visible presence being at the top of efficiency. A mounted officer can both see and be seen easier. This has a calming effect on the public as well as encourages approaching the officer. We were often approached about very minor things, which didn't warrant any kind of report or anything, but that keeps the public happy and calm to be able to let the authorities know about. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horses offer a number of benefits in city environments that make them an ideal partner in many situations. They allow a rider to sit up high for a better view of what's going on. They can turn around or maneuver in tighter spaces than a car could. Horses are great for dealing with crowds as well, because they're big animals and if they push you, you're going to move. There's also a bit of natural fear that humans have of a big animal that may trample them, so people tend to respect a horse much more than they respect a police car. Adding to that, some people won't think twice about smashing a cop car window, but it's a whole different story if you're attacking an animal. Especially if that animal can fight back.</p>
<p>It's also only my personal opinion, but I think a cop on a horse is seen as a bit more friendly and personable than a cop in a car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're usually used for crowd control purposes. Being on a horse allows the officer more visibility while also being easier to spot for those who may need them. They're also used where a car just wouldn't be practical, like a wilderness areas or a very large grassy park, ex: Central Park in New York</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to wonder about this too. Then I was caught in a football riot, and saw a mass of hundreds controlled by just a few cops on horses. The sight of those beasts coming towards you in a row, slowly and inexorably, is awe-inspiring. I can't even imagine what having them galloping at you would do to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I live in a town outside Edinburgh, and one time the crime got so bad they had police on horses patrolling certain estates all day. Was quite weird but I guess it does deter people from committing crimes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
