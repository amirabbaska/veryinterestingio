		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hannah Morris and Becca Peixotto are two of six scientists comprising the Advance Science Team on the <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/blog/rising-star-expedition/" target="_blank">Rising Star Expedition</a>, led by paleoanthropologist and National Geographic explorer-in-residence Lee Berger. This group of scientists <a href="http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09560" target="_blank">published a study</a> in the journal eLife last Thursday reporting their discovery of 1,500 fossilized bones deep in a South African cave 30 miles northwest of Johannesburg. These remains belong to a creature now known as Homo naledi, or “star” in the Sotho language. The finding could potentially rewrite Homo sapiens’ coming-of-age story and help fill in a crucial gap in the fossil record.</p>
<p>The site required a special team of experts slender enough to wriggle down a vertical, pitch-dark, seven-inch-wide passage. Morris and Peixotto fit that bill. They descended into the chamber through a narrow chute almost 100 yards from the cave entrance, and used toothpicks to dig out the ancient fossils without damaging them.</p>

<p>I grew up caving and climbing with my family in northwest Georgia, and got involved in archaeology in college. I traveled around as a “shovelbum” for a few years, hopping between Mexico and Alaska and the southeast U.S. I started working with the American Museum of Natural History on a barrier island, St. Catherine’s Island, off the coast of Georgia in 2008. I’ve excavated in some unusual and intense circumstances, keeping an eye out for moose and bear in Alaska and working in the marsh in a rising tide in Georgia. I was actually on a dig on the island when I came in from the field one day and saw the job posting on Facebook. I had a very interesting interview with Lee via Skype, and then within 2 weeks I was on a plane headed for Joburg. The project has been one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had, for so many reasons. Obviously, the science is amazing, and how we excavated the site and what we found is going to change paleoanthropology forever. In addition to the scientific impact, the Rising Star Expedition has had a huge personal impact on us all, I think. It’s very exciting to be involved with so many wonderful people, who are so dedicated to this common goal of advancing and promoting science, and it’s been really rewarding to see the public get involved and excited about this project.</p>
<p>Becca Peixotto: @beccapeixotto</p>
<p>I heard about the famous Facebook ad from a friend who forwarded it to me with a note “this sounds like you.” A small archaeologist with caving and climbing experience for a mysterious expedition in South Africa?  I sent my CV to Lee, talked with him over Skype and just a few weeks later I was arriving in Jo’burg. My previous career (with which I am still involved sometimes) was in outdoor and experiential education. I led wilderness expeditions including rock climbing and caving in mountain and desert environments for Outward Bound and other organizations (and I’ve done those activities on countless personal adventures too). Joining Rising Star was an exciting way to out my technical outdoor skills to use in my other passion of archaeology. I often find myself excavating in remote, inaccessible locations with challenging environments like the Rising Star cave or the remote interior of the Great Dismal Swamp (VA and NC- the location of my PhD research). It has been such a joy and privilege to be a part of Rising Star. The fossil discovery is mind-blowing in itself but Rising Star has also raised the bar for how paleoanthropology happens: where we look, the technology we use to record sites, who gets to excavate and analyze the fossils and how we communicate the process of doing this kind of science with the world.</p></div></div>
