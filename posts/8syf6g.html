</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the gas exchange process only requires a sufficient amount of water passing over a large surface area of the gills.  Gravity is not a significant part of the process (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546509808601326" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546509808601326</a>), although it does affect the structure of the fish and the strength of their bones. (<a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/20/3605.2" target="_blank">http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/20/3605.2</a>)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Only because you specified a bowl.  It would not really be an air bubble but the fish would push water away.  Without gravity to keep the water in the bowl it would be pushed out, and the empty space would be filled in by the surrounding air.  Eventually the fish would just be floating in the air flapping its fins uselessly, and the water would be floating all over the space station.</p>
<p>Solution: sealed container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And beyond all this, would the fish be able to even handle being in 0 gravity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They can live there, but they cannot navigate properly.  The fish swim in loops instead of straight lines because they do not have Earth's gravity to orient them vertically.</p>

<p>If water forms a bubble in space, couldn't we just trap a fish in a large water droplet and have it float around the ISS sans-tank?</p>
<p>Serious question (in theory obviously, I'm sure there are other complications from a big ass water droplet floating around a billion dollar piece of delicate machinery).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Yes.
2) Flapping around in water doesn't create pockets of not-water. Maybe it seems that way when you spash around at the surface of water and air and you mix the two, but if you had a bubble big enough to maintain cohesion, and a fish inside, it would be okay as long as it didn't leave the bubble.</p>
<p>Fish depend on gravity and bouyancy to know where up and down is, so taking that away would probably be a very confusing and bizarre situation for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-on question:  </p>
<p>I had read years ago that a fish could survive in 100% humidity air. Fish die out of water because the gills collapse, not from lack of oxygen. Air actually has a higher O2 content than water. Theoretically a fish can extract O2 from air more efficiently than we can, as long as the gills can be supported.  In zero G, that's not an issue.  </p>
<p>Has anyone else heard this? Has the experiment been done?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
