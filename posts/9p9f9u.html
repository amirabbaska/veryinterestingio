		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pneumatic tires come with several benefits. The first is cost. The materials are more expensive than the manufacture. Weight. It is incredibly fuel inefficient to get wheels that heavy - as solid rubber tires, rotating. It's even harder to get that much weight to stop. And the steel wheel would have to be thicker, the breaks larger, or we'd have to go back to drum brakes on cars, which are themselves more expensive and dissipate heat less. All that weight puts additional strain on the drivetrain and breaking system. Traction. Since the tire is solid rubber, the face can't deflect - flatten out to increase surface area contact. This reduces traction. Wear. Such large and heavy masses, rotating at high speed, I'm not sure the tire could even hold itself together. Even if it can, what do you do once you wear off the tread? Do you put new tread on top? Do you cut new tread into the existing rubber, and wear the thing down to a nub like an eraser? Do you replace the whole wheel and recycle the materials?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pneumatic tires are also part of the suspension, since they act like a spring. The whole point of the suspension is to keep the rubber on the road, and make the ride comfortable. A solid rubber wheel, you would feel every rock, every crack, every *leaf*. And pneumatic tires can deflect around small surface imperfections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Turns out - airplane tires are pumped up with more pressure than a car tire to increase its strength. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some tires are solid rubber, it depends on the needs. They can carry greater loads and resist punctures. However, they are heavier, and provide less comfort (transmit more bumps). Additionally, they heat up more significantly, and flex less, which can contribute to faster degradation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
