		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a ping pong ball, and you filled it with cool whip. Now shrink that whole thing down to the size of a fly. Now imagine you threw that tiny little shell full of goop at the wall. Even if you threw it as hard as you could, it's still soooo tiny and soooo tough and bouncy on the outside that it'll just bounce off. </p>
<p>Flies are super tiny, and have a shell just like that ping pong ball, but with little flexible, foldable wings. And just like a fly, if you use a slingshot instead of your hand (a moving car instead of a window) you might just get it to pop. </p>
<p><strong>Edit for a bit more actual explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Flies have an exoskeleton that's incredibly tough and hard in some spots, and just flexible enough to be springy and bouncy in others. Just like that ping pong ball, they've got a shell that's good at taking a bit of a hit and bouncing off instead of just squishing like a worm (which doesn't have that tough shell).</p>
<p>The fact that they're so small helps in a couple different ways as well. For one, we <em>think</em> they're flying super fast, but it's really just because they're tiny. If you look at a massive airplane, it might be moving at 500 miles per hour but still looks like it's just crawling along across the sky. Houseflies look fast, but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+fast+are+houseflies" target="_blank">I asked Google</a> and they only go about 5 miles per hour. That means a baseball pitcher can throw a fastball <strong>20 times as fast as a housefly flies</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only are they actually super slow (if you don't let the size trick you), they also weigh almost nothing. Like, it would take about 200 flies to add up to the weight of a single ping pong ball, according to some quick Googling/converting.</p>
<p>So your ping pong ball full of cool whip is actually super tough, reaaally slow, and unbelievably lightweight, meaning that dumb little fly was <em>designed</em> to fly into the window several thousand times before it finds the opening. Evolution at work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's partly low mass and their exoskeleton, but that isn't the entire reason.</p>
<p>It's because of the square - cube law. </p>
<p>This principle states that, as a shape (or creature) grows in size, its volume (and weight) grows faster than its surface area. So when the fly hits the wall, there is less weight dispersed over a larger surface area (relatively) than a larger creature.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law</a></p>
<p>This is also why children can comfortably sit on their knees,  but adults can't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short and sweet answer is that they have such a small mass and move so slowly.</p>
<p>Let's say you have an average housefly named Luke Flywalker. Luke has a mass of 12mg (0.000012kg) and has a max flying speed of 5mph (2.235 m/s). You find him resting on a delicious plate of mac &amp; cheese that you want to eat so you swat him. </p>
<p>Scared for his tiny life, he instantly engages his tiny thrusters to make the jump to flyperspace and starts flying away as fast as he can, reaching max speed after flying for 1 full second. Let's also say that the idea of being smushed has brought back haunting trash compactor memories (from a sleep-over at his dad's house a long time ago) so terrifying that he doesn't pay attention to where he's going and flies right into a glass window as soon as he hits max speed. This gives the fly an acceleration of 2.235 (m/s)/s at the time of impact.</p>
<p>Now, the Force (hehe) equals mass multiplied by acceleration (F=ma). So if this young Jedfly reached his max speed at the instant of impact, he would still only strike it with a Force of 0.00002682 Newtons (0.000012kg x 2.235m/s^2).</p>
<p>So since 1 lbf (pound-force) is equal to 4.48 Newtons, Luke Flywalker flying at max speed into a window only puts 0.00000603 lbs of force in his body and he is free to eat your food another day.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arthropods that fly have very low mass. They also have a lightweight armour made largely of chitin. This exoskeleton protects their nervous system (brain) organs and muscles. It's like a body helmet. Lastly, they have an open circulatory system that prevents them from inflammation damage, i.e., bruising.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the square-cubed law. Basically as things get smaller they get stronger proportional to their weight. The idea is that strength is mostly determined by the cross sectional area of whatever it is you are measuring, which increases with the square of the dimensions. The weight usually increases with the cube of the dimension. So if you have a rectangular bar and double its size its strength will increase four times, but it's weight will increase by eight times making it half as strong for its weight. This is also why ants can lift six times their body weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
