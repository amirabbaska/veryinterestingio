<p>Edit: This is by a large margin the most successful post I've ever made. Thank you to everyone answering! Most of the replies have answered several other questions I have had and made me think of a lot more, so keep it up because you guys are awesome! </p>
<p>Edit 2: like a hundred people have said to get to the other side. I don't think that's quite the answer I'm looking for... Everyone else has done a great job. Keep the conversation going because new stuff keeps getting brought up! </p>
<p>Edit 3: I posted this a while ago but it seems that it's been found again, and someone has been kind enough to give me gold! This is the first time I've ever recieved gold for a post and I am incredibly grateful! Thank you so much and let's keep the discussion going! </p>
<p>Edit 4: Wow! This is now the highest rated ELI5 post of all time! Holy crap this is the greatest thing that has ever happened in my life, thank you all so much! </p>
<p>Edit 5: It seems that people keep finding this post after several months, and I want to say that this is exactly the kind of community input that redditors should get some sort of award for. Keep it up, you guys are awesome!</p>
<p>Edit 6: No problem </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>corpuscle's answer is a relativistic way of looking at it. However this is not how the speed of light was originally discovered/predicted. If you apply Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism to a moving charge you see that alternating electric and magnetic fields radiate from the charge at the fastest speed possible.</p>
<p>Basically, a changing electric field creates a perpendicular magnetic field. Also, a changing magnetic field creates a perpendicular electric field. As either a magnetic or electric field is created, this counts as changing that field, and therefor a chain reaction is triggered. Light is basically like electromagnetic ripples.</p>
<p>It takes some pretty high level mathematical analysis on waves to understand why light travels at C, but it naturally follows Maxwell's laws. While studying Maxwell's work, Einstein took it to be absolutely true that nothing can travel faster than light and it became one of the few assumptions that birthed relativity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read through as much of this amazing thread as I could, and didn't see an answer to a question I still have. Apologies if it has already been addressed, but it's something I have wondered about for a while, and I am absolutely confident that someone on here can explain it so that I finally understand it. </p>
<p>So much of these explanations depend upon the perspective of an observer in order to make sense. So, from my perspective, if I sitting at my chair reading reddit, I am not moving through space to any appreciable degree, but I am moving through time, right?</p>
<p>Except, I am on a planet that is moving through space very quickly, in a solar system that is also moving through space, etc. Right? Isn't my sense that I am not moving- because my brain is not physically moving my body through space- just a problem of perception? With the proper equipment, couldn't I suddenly perceive that I am actually moving very fast through space, as fast as the plane beneath me is moving? So how does this factor into my relativistic sense of things? Isn't all motion on earth also affected by the motion of the planet, relating to other observable objects? </p>
<p>I guess I can sort of see how this doesn't matter in term of observing other things on this planet, but most of the light I use to observe this is generated off-planet. And even the light generated ON the planet would seem to be affected differently, if at all, by the planet's motion. So even though I know I can't acheive some kind of observational null-state, isn't my perception of my place in space-time relative to other objects always going to be really, really off?</p>
<p>Apologies if this doesn't make any sense. I guess I'm just really saying, how can I ever state that I am motionless relative to anything else, when I am set upon a body in motion?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Packing light has always been a savvy travel tip, because hauling less weight means you travel with more comfort and freedom.</p>
<p>But now, when you consider the baggage fees implemented by most airlines, packing light makes more sense than ever. Most airlines charge per-piece fees for your luggage as well as extra-weight fees for bags over 50 lbs. (Check your airline for the latest info.)</p>
<p>As Rick Steves, the travel guru who has written books such as Europe through the Back Door, advises, &quot;Pack light, wash frequently, buy it if you need it.&quot; He suggests limiting yourself to one bag of about 20 pounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps!  Safe --and light-- travels to you!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since this is ELI5, here is the really simple version without bringing spacetime into it.  </p>
<p>The speed of anything is basically determined by it's weight and the amount energy that is pushing it.  You can push your toy cars really fast but if you try to push a real car it's a lot harder.  That's because it weighs more.  Light weighs nothing, so it moves at full speed all the time with no push at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
