		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The English language has many homographs: words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently. Think of the bow of a ship and a bow made of ribbon; or an invalid in a wheelchair as opposed to an invalid input.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is because English spelling rules are a mess. We haven't had a proper spelling reform since the introduction of printing, but the way we speak has continued to change through the centuries. As a result, our written language is seriously out of step with our spoken language.</p>
<p>The word &quot;job&quot; appears to come from the 15th-century &quot;gobbe&quot;, meaning &quot;lump&quot; or &quot;piece&quot;: it was in the phrase &quot;gobbe of worke&quot;. Over time, the &quot;of work&quot; was dropped because it became redundant, the &quot;g&quot; was softened to a &quot;j&quot; sound and the meaning was expanded from the original sense of &quot;a task&quot; to &quot;paid work&quot; and then to &quot;occupation&quot;.</p>
<p>The name &quot;Job&quot; comes from the Hebrew &quot;Iyov&quot;, although the &quot;o&quot; was pronounced a bit more like our modern long &quot;o&quot; (not <em>quite</em> like it, but similar), and the &quot;i&quot; was pronounced like our &quot;ee&quot;. The sounds represented by &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, as anyone who has learned Spanish will know, are very closely related and can sometimes be confused.</p>
<p>But we didn't get the name directly from Hebrew. Instead, we got it from the Latin translation of the Old Testament. Latin originally didn't have a letter &quot;j&quot;: it used the letter &quot;i&quot; to represent both a vowel sound (&quot;ee&quot;) and a semi-vowel (like our &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yes&quot;). Latin also dropped the first vowel, giving us &quot;Iob&quot;, pronounced roughly &quot;yobe&quot;. Later, the new &quot;j&quot; was created as a variation of &quot;i&quot; and became used for the half-consonant sound, giving us the modern spelling &quot;Job&quot;. Then the sound of the &quot;j&quot; changed, by a complicated process, to its modern version.</p>
<p>Not all languages did this. In German Bibles, for example, the name is much closer to the original Hebrew: it is sometimes written &quot;Ijob&quot; (the German &quot;j&quot; still represents the &quot;y&quot; sound), but more usually it's aspirated, meaning an &quot;h&quot; sound is added, so in most German Bibles it's &quot;Hiob&quot; (without the &quot;j&quot;, because it's actually superfluous), pronounced approximately &quot;hee-obe&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They came to us through completely different routes.</p>
<p>Biblical Job is a Hebrew name through Greek and Latin, with a soft j/i and a long o, more like &quot;eeobe&quot;.</p>
<p>Job as occupation is much more recent, might be from &quot;gob&quot; as in a lump (of work to do). Johnson's dictionary has</p>
<p>job. (1) A low mean lucrative busy affair. (2) Petty, piddling work; a piece of chance work.</p>
<p>which isn't very dignifying. Seems the hard &quot;g&quot; was softened along the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the more interesting question is &quot;why is the name written 'Job' &quot;? The historic name is more like &quot;e-ob&quot; (like <strong>e-</strong>mail). In some languages that changed a bit over time. <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179962" target="_blank">Wikidata has a list</a>, many languages are still close to the historic name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Hebrew Bible, his name is אִיּוֹב, although I've written that with the vowels in, and that style of vowel didn't even exist until many hundreds of years after the book was written. Regardless, in Hebrew, his name would be pronounced more like ee-YOV or ee-obe.</p>
<p>Remember your Indiana Jones movies. There's no &quot;J&quot; sound in Hebrew. Lots of other common Hebrew names are said very differently in English than they would have been at the time, including other J names like Jesus, but also other names like Isaac (Yitz-Hhawk).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
