		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President is the head of the Executive branch of the US government and is in charge of executing the laws through enforcement (the police are an example of the executive branch acting to enforce laws on the state level, the national guard being sent into an area to enforce laws such as the desegregation in Little Rock at the national level). One way the President can enforce/execute the laws is through an executive order. However, because the President is only in charge of executing the laws and not making the the laws (which is left up to Congress), the President needs an actual law (let's call it a &quot;base law&quot;) to attach an executive order to. The President cannot (or should not) just make things up and sign executive orders that mandate things Congress has not contemplated. </p>
<p>In the scenario of the Muslim Ban, President Trump's executive order probably falls under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which is the immigration policy of the US. Section 212 of the INA deals with &quot;Inadmissible Aliens.&quot; That chapter basically lists the situations in which an immigrant will be considered &quot;inadmissible,&quot;- not allowed entrance into the country. </p>
<p>So, it is not completely true that the other two branches of government do not approve of the President's executive orders. The base law must still be passed by Congress, following all of the bicameral steps to become an actual law. The Judicial branch sort of stays out of everything until it is called upon through a lawsuit. In fact, it is a practice of the Supreme Court not to even entertain questions of Constitutionality before a law is passed or has been challenged in a lower court. Neither Congress nor the President can ask the Supreme Court whether a law (and probably an executive order by extension) is constitutional before it has been challenged. In other words, the Supreme Court does not approve or disapprove of laws until it is asked to do so. </p>
<p>In addition, as other posters have pointed out, Trump's order was done under the color of national security. In general, when a law or order has been passed through the proper steps, the Supreme Court will usually defer to the other two branches. For example, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order mandating the detainment of Japanese citizens on the west coast during WWII. When this order was challenged in Court (See &quot;Korematsu&quot;), the Court held that the interment was not a violation of the Constitution because national security is regarded as a higher priority. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It falls under the purview of the President, as it is considered a case of immediate national security.  The precedent was set by John Adams in 1798 as a result of our relations with France.  The Alien &amp; Sedition act gave the president the right to imprison, deport, or refuse immigrants from a nation considered hostile to the US. </p>
<p>First, it is not a &quot;Muslim ban.&quot;  No one is barred entry due to their religious beliefs.  It is a temporary suspension of immigration from countries with a high rate of radicalization into ISIS, which has used the immigration process in the past to get onto US soil.  Immigration from these countries is only expected to last as long as it takes to come up with a thorough and effective vetting process, to determine no ill intent or ISIS affiliation of the person entering the US. </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this is not the first time the President has suspended immigration from certain countries due to high risk of people immigrating from those countries.  </p>
<p>In 1882, President Chester Arthur suspended immigration from China, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1889 as constitutional.  Justice Stephen Johnson Field wrote, &quot;The power of the government to exclude foreigners from the country whenever, in its judgment, the public interests require such exclusion, has been asserted in repeated instances, and never denied by the executive or legislative departments.&quot;</p>
<p>The immigration act of 1917 was passed by congress which barred immigration from Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>And in response to Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspended immigration from Japan, Germany, and Italy with Presidential Proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527. </p>
<p>This current temporary suspension is due to the same sort of risks FDR was responding to.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The executive branch is usually given a lot of leeway by congress on how to actually enforce the law. A law about banking may just say &quot;the treasury will make rules to regulate this activity.&quot;</p>
<p>So an executive order can say how a particular administration will handle that. </p>
<p>Of course the other two branches can step in. A judge may say that the EO doesn't follow the law like it should and the legislature could pass a law against what the EO does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President as head of the executive branch has always had the task of implementing laws passed by Congress. There is never enough detail in a law to put it into practice. The President issues and executive order with sufficient detail that a government department can implement the law. Exactly how much detail is done at what level is negotiable and variable.</p>
<p>President Bush began issuing broader executive orders. The practice continued under more Presidents. conservatives grumbled that Obama was issuing executive orders violating the Constitution. But these orders were carefully researched. None were successfully challenged in a court of law.</p>
<p>As President Trump has shown, executive orders can be issued immediately. The other two branches of government operate much more slowly. Congress can pass more specific laws. Lawsuits can be filed challenging the executive orders. This seems much more likely because Trump's executive orders do not seem to be well researched or even well thought out.</p>
<p>Bur lawsuits take time to file and appeals take a long time to move through the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
