		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biplanes are really not advantageous. The only reason biplanes were used was because technology hadn't advanced far enough to allow any other options. Prior to WWII, plane engines mostly weren't powerful enough to provide the necessary lift with monoplanes, and aircraft structures weren't strong enough to support the forces of flight on a single set of wings. There were some monoplanes in service in WWI but they were far outnumbered and generally outperformed by biplanes. By the 30's technology improved to the point where monplanes became not only more feasible but actually better than biplanes at most things. Once this happened, biplanes pretty quickly went from the majority of planes being manufactured to limited numbers meant for niche roles.</p>
<p>Biplanes can add lift and maneuverability, but this comes at the cost of a ton of extra drag (which means far less fuel efficiency and in may cases worse maneuverability and high-speed performance) and poor visibility. There's nothing a modern monoplane can do that it would do better as a bi-plane, and in fact, designing modern planes such as commercial airliners or fighters around biplane wing architecture would all around worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole point of a biplane design is to achieve a given wing area with the lightest possible structure. In a monoplane, the wing roots (where the wings meet the fuselage) has to carry a large bending load, which means it has to be very stiff, which means it's heavy. In a biplane, the wings are interconnected by an array of compression members (struts) and tension members (wires), which is very light.  </p>
<p>The biplane design also keeps the wingspan small, which means the moment of inertia in the roll axis is small, which means it's very <em>maneuverable</em> and great for aerobatics.  </p>
<p>The downside is that all that external structure makes <em>drag</em>, and the faster you want to go, the worse it gets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other than all the engineering/physics answers already here from an air combat standpoint pretty much from 1940 onwards speed and climb rate asserted it's dominance as the desirable characteristic of fighter aircraft over maneuverability.</p>
<p>Agility was nice to have but the higher, faster aircraft always dictates the fight to the slower one - regardless of how maneuverable it is. Biplanes are superbly agile but all that turning still bleeds speed and they don't have that much to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biplanes effectively provide more lift but more drag: they fly well slowly, and poorly at high speeds.</p>
<p>Monoplanes have less drag, so are more efficient, but need to go faster to have enough lift.  Biplanes also mean you can have shorter wings which mean less angular momentum and less strain on the wingtips when turning.</p>
<p>The missing part here is <em>flaps</em>: extendable bits of wing surface which make the same tradeoff of giving more lift but more drag when extended.  When a modern plane flies they have flaps extended for takeoff and landing (low speed where you want plenty of lift), then the flaps retract into the wings so the plane can fly more efficiently once it's at speed.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, manoeuvrability isn't as much of a concern in modern aircraft because passenger planes don't need to turn that fast and military aircraft focus more on pure speed.  The one place it does matter is for aerobatics or rural &quot;bush aircraft&quot;: if you look at a red bull air race plane or bush plane you'll see short wings for manoeuvrability, and relatively large flaps.  Huge increases in engine power and material strength mean these planes can fly a lot faster so only need the lift of a single wing when at speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technical limitations around the engine was a major issue in early planes. There was no access to a small and light powerful engine.
The low power of the engines meant low airspeeds and less lift from the wings, to counter this they added additional wings to generate more lift.
As the power to weight ratio of engines improved the lift problem was largely overcome via higher airspeed and the dominant issue became drag. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
