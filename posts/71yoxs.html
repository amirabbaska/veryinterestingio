		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has given a proper answer here, so I'll see if I can make a very clear answer.</p>
<p>Take a look at this photo of chipped glass pieces: <a href="https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1P_vdHXXXXXbeaXXXq6xXFXXXb/200217028/HTB1P_vdHXXXXXbeaXXXq6xXFXXXb.jpg" target="_blank">Photo</a></p>
<p>Notice how the glass has bright reflections in it on the edges. Yet if it were not ground up you'd just see the green color you see in some other parts of the photo.</p>
<p>This is the effect of scintillation or light bouncing around inside an object, and the effect of being redirected and focused or spread out. This is exactly why a diamond is shiny where as a sheet of glass is clear.</p>
<p>The exact same process is happing with the water. It's like taking a big sheet of clear material and turning it into many very very small sparking gemstones. The gemstones will appear far brighter, because they reflect light most of the time, while the sheet appears clear most of the time. Flat planes like lakes only shine in at one angle which is why you get a blinding reflection of the setting sun off the water but <em>not</em> off the waterfall. That's where the extra brightness is coming from.</p>
<p>The thing that turns a dark surface of water into bright waterfall is millions of tiny air pockets being trapped in the water. These then act like the above mentioned gemstones and sparkle inside the water itself, making it lighter. So the millions of tiny diamonds in water make it white. That's how I usually teach this to kids.</p>
<p>Hopefully that helped.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a nice example of a macro photo of water foam, you can see the reflection of the window on the bubbles giving them brightness, but the window is not reflected on the undistubed water. <a href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/aga7ta/aga7ta1501/aga7ta150100195/35759505-foam-bubbles-on-blue-water-background-Stock-Photo.jpg" target="_blank">Photo</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a similar mechanic to crushing glass into a powder. You could use that to illustrate the process, as glass goes from transparent to white, the more finely you ground it. I do admit though, that this is maybe not the safest thing to do with your child...</p>
<p>The reason for both materials turning white is the increased amount of surfaces. When you have a still body of water, you have one surface. Light will reflect in this, it works like a mirror. The only difference to a mirror is, that part of the light goes through the surface layer, instead of being reflected. This is why you also can see below the surface of the water. Because of the even surface, just like a mirror, any light that gets reflected, gets reflected at a constant angle. This means you reflect the whole picture.</p>
<p>If you were to roughen up the surface of a mirror, the light would not be reflected in the same direction, but in a <a href="https://www.online-sciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/reflection-of-light-44.gif" target="_blank">random direction</a>. This is the reason why roughed glass gets milky and white. This might also be a safer example to show your kid. Buy a piece of plexi glass, show how it reflects light (and pictures, like the water), then rough it up.</p>
<p>Now back to the water. When you start stirring the water, the light still reflects, but the picture gets less clear. You will start to see only jumbled forms. If it is really rough, air will be trapped in the water, creating bubbles. Those also have surfaces, where the light reflects. Remember the light that goes through the top surface of the water? Some of this might now hit the bubble and be reflected back towards the surface.</p>
<p>Now you have a waterfall. This means you have lots and lots of bubbles in the water. Because of that, basically all the light gets reflected back out, as it is reflected of the bubbles. But as the bubbles are very uneven, just like your roughened glass, the light gets reflected back in random directions. This is why you get an even white, instead of a clear picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Petwins is right. It's the same mechanism that makes a cloud white - it's a lot of water droplets spaced out in air, which scatter light uniformly, making it white (all colors represented equally). Any suspension of particles larger than the wavelength of light (400-800 nm) will tend to do this. </p>
<p>This is also why milk is white, even though it's mostly water (clear) and suspended &quot;butter&quot; particles (yellow) - the size and distribution of the fat particles causes the same kind of uniform light reflections, making it white. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> changed wavelength units from Âµm to nm - thanks u/HuntertheGoose for pointing it out. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> The technical term for this kind of scattering is &quot;Mie scattering&quot; -- thanks u/UniqueMumbles for the addition</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering</a>,  <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/mch/sct.rxml" target="_blank">http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/mch/sct.rxml</a></p>
<p>It's related to Rayleigh scattering, which is when you have slightly smaller particles, and is the reason the sky is blue, because the particle size is small enough to select blue light preferentially. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its aerating. Basically being filler with air bubbles which makes it frothy. The froth is white due to the diffraction of light with the highly curved bubbles. </p>
<p>But basically its air bubbles in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reasons clouds are white. </p>
<p>Water is clear but it also reflects light. Anytime a wave (like light) travels through one clear medium and transitions to another with a different density, like water, some of the wave will get reflected back. Itâs just like an echo. When a sound wave travels through air and hits a denser material (like a wall) some portion of it it reflects back too. </p>
<p>Ever see a slinky demonstration of a wave? If one end is tied to something that doesnât vibrate as fast (is denser) it will echo and some of the wave will bounce back (reflect). </p>
<p>It does this because incident (incoming) waves move faster through the air than through the water so some of the waves behind it crash into the slowed down waves and have to reverse direction. To dissipate. </p>
<p>So, when water is frothed, light transitions from air to water and back over and over. It acts like a thousand little mirrors, reflecting back part of the wave like the surface of the water does. The overlapping reflections blend together and gives the color that light gives when many colors are mixed together - white. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
