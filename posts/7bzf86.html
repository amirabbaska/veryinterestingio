		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although you related your question with medicine, I have experience with NMR in chemistry research. Not exactly the same technique, but the principles are the same.</p>
<p>In my experience the complete (+99%) relaxation of protons is around 10 to 15 seconds, but most of them will have relaxed in about 3 to 4 seconds, so this is the usual time between scans. Sometimes, a proton can relax more slowly due to its &quot;chemical circumstances&quot;, but in general is not the case.</p>
<p>Is it fast? Is it slow? It depends on what you expect. You can consider it fast if you want to know how much time will pass before your body gets &quot;normal&quot; after an NMR scan, as seconds is fast and days would be slow. But spectroscopically speaking, it is a slow technique. IR, or UV-visible fluorescence have relaxation times around nanoseconds. Compared to that, 3 seconds are a lot. In fact, in chemistry is enough for two species in equilibrium to interconvert, so it's not uncommon to get NMR espectra of the average of those two compounds, as in that amount of time you see both many times. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You are looking for the T1 times when you talk about most 'protons to return to being randomly oriented'. For a simple explanation of T1 check <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/t1-relaxation-time" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time to return to equilibrium after a scan is likely the same as the T1 relaxation time. T1 is MRI name for the spin-lattice relaxation time. We measure this in the scanner for different tissues to detect changes in the chemical composition of the tissue (largely in neuroscience.) The main difference is that we are measuring a return to equilibrium in the scanner after excitation, but the same should be true for ‘removing’ the field.</p>
<p>White matter T1s range from about 1100-1700 ms, gray I think is a bit shorter. Times increase with field strength. The equation is m(t) = m(0) * ( 1 - e ^(-t/T1))</p>
<p>This also gets used to help detect tumors by adding T1 relaxing agents (the contrast Chuck Norris is suing alters the T1 relaxation time.)</p>
<p>And, old school resistive scanners (sub 0.5T usually) and some of the experimental ultra low field scanners like MGH’s 0.065 T can be turned off more easily since they are not superconducting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in an experimental solid-state NMR lab, but the physics is identical.  I read through some of the answers and it's just not complete or just outright faceplamingly WRONG.</p>
<p>Before I launch into my tirade, let me establish that signal /= population. </p>
<p>Short answer: Population decays exponentially toward its equilibrium population distribution described by a time constant T1.  The signal itself decays by dephasing in a similar exponential-decaying fashion with time constant T2.  How efficient the T1  processes are are directly related to how large of an oscillating dipole moment is felt by the nucleus. In more laymans terms, the ability to induce a spin flip. To expand on /u/javier1287, protons in a dangling protein chain generally relax faster compared to something like protons in a rigid mineral, since there are fewer chances for inducing a spin flip.</p>
<p>Long-ass answer where I'm going to include less-relevant information since there's misinformation in other answers:</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics approach:  There's a natural distribution of spin up to spin down (for I=1/2 nuclei, like 1H) since there is an energy difference between these states in a magnetic field, there is an equilibrium population difference described by Boltzmann statistics.</p>
<p>There is ALWAYS a static magnetic field on, B0, defined in the z-direction, it is NEVER turned off.  It is this field that creates the Boltzmann distribution that the populations decay toward.</p>
<p>During an experiment, you perturb the population distribution of spin up and spin down, creating 1st-order coherences.  The population distribution is now out of equilibrium. After some time, through interactions, this distribution will naturally be achieved.</p>
<p>Spin-lattice (T1) interactions relate to spontaneous 1H spin flips induced by interacting with a moving dipolar moment, like an unpaired electron or any moving molecule.</p>
<p>Relaxation agents used in MRI capitalize on having a species with unpaired electrons.  Unpaired electrons have HUGE dipolar moments Gadolinium for example can have an electronic configuration with 7 unpaired electrons!  Any protons near a relaxation agent will relax toward its equilibrium population distribution at a much higher rate due to the much more likely event of a favorable interaction causing a spontaneous spin flip.    If you have infinite spin flips, you achieve the Boltzmann distribution (equilibrium).  We say &quot;good enough&quot; after we're ~99% the way there, which is about after a time 5*T1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The protons are aligned with a magnetic field, and when the magnet is turned off they snap out of alignment. When they ping in or <em>out</em> of alignment they give off a little radio signal which is what the detector uses to make up a picture.</p>
<p>In short, what you're asking about is actually how the MRI actually makes images, so yes it's very fast.</p>
<p>For more information look up NMR relaxation times</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
