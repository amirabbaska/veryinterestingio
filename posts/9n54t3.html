		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you are removing the protective oils and physically irritation your lips each time. The result is that it gets your lips wet again (the instant relief) but then because that barrier is gone that water quickly vanished, and now you’re worse off than when you started (because you’ve sandpapered away that protective layer).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin is constantly losing moisture. It's called transepidermal water loss. </p>
<p>Sebum is naturally produced by your skin to counteract rapid evaporation, protect you from germs, etc. It's basically your natural moisturizer and waterproofer. Without sebum your skin will become brittle and dry. Your saliva is wiping away your sebum and the enzymes in your saliva are causing further damage to your skin by slightly digesting it. </p>
<p>So you're already losing moisture anyway, and you've licked away your only natural defense against moisture loss. </p>
<p>You need an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer" target="_blank">emollient </a>  and/or a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humectant" target="_blank">humectant </a>  to fix chapped lips. Saliva is neither. Neither is water! Most people have tried straight water as a cure before if they didn't have a chapstick handy, but it evaporates quickly and just leaves you feeling worse. </p>
<p>An emollient will keep moisture trapped in. A humectant will attract moisture from the its environment (the air in this case) and hold onto it so that you are being supplied with moisture. An example of an emollient is petrolatum (Vaseline) and an example of a humectant is glycerin. One of the most unpleasant parts of chapped lips is the stiffness of the skin, and a humectant will go the extra mile to restore softness. </p>
<p>A good chapstick also lubricates so that you don't chap your lips even more as you talk, eat, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that the enzymes in your saliva break down the food to prepare your stomach to digest it. Since the enzymes digest the food, they also have some effect on your lips if you lick them all the time. Very science, much descriptive. I know</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understood that it is due to the enzymes in saliva that assist in the digestion process. This is why licking your lips and putting on chapstick right after makes them feel worse.</p>
<p>No the enzymes do not make flesh eating spit, they become more active when you chew food, and helps to break it down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
