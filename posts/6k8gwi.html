		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is we are not sure. </p>
<p>But these are the plausible reasons which are widely agreed on :</p>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong> It is a psychological reaction which pretty much relates someone else's body to our own. It exists so that humans could work together better and to have us avoid killing each other in most cases. Well, the face reaction is really just us putting ourselves into that persons shoes, and reacting how they would.  </p>
<p>But there is this study that claims it has nothing to do with how empathetic the person is.  - <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
<p>From an evolutionary view it is beneficial for us to easily remember bad memories. This helps us avoid repeating mistakes we have witnessed and keep us out of dangers way e.g. My friend was eaten by a bear in that cave, I remember this in great detail and avoid that cave in future so I'm less likely to be eaten by a bear.
I think it might be similar for things we find embarrassing. </p>
<p>It's dangerous to do things that alienate you from a group since we are social creatures that rely on acceptance and group work to survive. If we remember things we've done before that threatened our social standing then we aren't likely to repeat the behaviour in future and avoid exclusion. That's just speculation though.
for people asking for more info on this I highly recommend looking up evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>'Evolutionary theories of emotion view emotions a
s adaptive traits - they help the organism to adapt to the demand of the environment and thereby survive' (Izard, 1977; Plutchik, 1984).</p>

<p>There's varying theories as to why embarrassment is good or bad, but it really boils down to surviving in the social and cultural customs of whatever group (tribe) you're in. If you don't fit in you aren't finding a mate. Feeling the embarrassment of your friend when they're unaware that they're not fitting in allows you to step in and save them, with the understanding that they'll do the same for you...you could think of Fremdschämen as nature's wingman.</p>
<p>You have to keep in mind that at our core we're still very much socially dependent pack animals. A key part of being able to survive as long as we have is our ability to empathize with others.</p>
<p>We're capable of feeling the pain, embarrassment, and even joy of others, which compels us to help and support one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have already mentioned mirror neurons and vicarious embarrassment but I think the key feature that a lot of people are missing is this. When you do something embarrassing, you elicit a negative response from the people around you, which causes tension and discomfort among the group. The most extreme case of this would be being ostracized from a group which would significantly lower an organism's chances for reproductive success.</p>
<p>Thus, when our brains view someone else in an embarrassing situation, we recall the feelings (often literal physical feelings) of what it was like to be embarrassed; basically your brain's way of telling you &quot;remember how bad that feels? Don't do that!&quot; much the same way we remember and avoid physical pain.</p>
<p>Basically, feeling vicarious embarrassment is our brain's way of &quot;sandboxing&quot; the emotional experience and subsequent processing of being embarrassed without having to first actually do something embarrassing. It's our brain warning us that whatever that person did that embarrassed them, we shouldn't do because it will feel super bad and risk being cast off from the group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans contain mirror neurons, which allows our brain to experience a few of the same feelings associated with an act we are viewing.</p>
<p>For instance, sports. People watch football and they enjoy it. </p>
<p>These motor neurons might possibly have an evolutionary advantage of allowing us to become more sociable, by understanding peoples emotions through vision alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have words for that in Spanish, not only for TV but also when someone, even a stranger, does something shameful or embarrasing nearby: <em>vergüenza ajena</em> (&quot;others' shame&quot;)</p>
<p>I believe it isn't much about empathy or mirror neurons, but for social acceptance: you feel ashamed because others might relate <em>him</em> or <em>her</em> to <em>you</em>. Proof is that it's hard to feel it if you're alone with the shameless one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
