		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies are caused by our immune system mistaking food or innocuous particles like pollen, for invading pathogens. </p>
<p>How does this happen? Well, all cells and viruses have chemical markers on their surfaces call Antigens. Our own cells can recognize each other by reading their antigens, and our immune cells are the same. When an immune cell encounters another object, it will read its antigens, and if it doesn't recognize them as friendly, it will attempt to destroy the object. </p>
<p>The immune system is also adaptable, and it has a memory. When we get chicken pox for example, after defeating it, the system will keep a record of the chicken pox antigens, so when the disease is encountered later on in life, our immune system already knows how to fight it.</p>
<p>Things that cause allergies also have antigens, and sometimes our immune system will encounter an antigen on some food, and mistakenly think its an invading pathogen. The immune system then mobilizes, attacks the foodstuff, and then keeps a record of its antigens. When the food is next encountered, the immune system will recognize it, and unleash its power to attack the food. The side effects of this battle is what we know as an allergy. </p>
<p>Because our immune system can make a mistake at any point in our life, we always retain the chances of developing new allergies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our immune system is made of cells that are able to spot, and destroy, things that should not be in our body (both external, like a virus, and internal, like a dead cell).</p>
<p>When these cells are born, they learn how to spot the stuff to destroy based on the first thing they come in contact with. So let’s say, a baby immune cell comes in contact with a bacteria. From now on, that particular cell is able to spot that particular bacteria. At this stage, the first thing they can come in contact with is something that is not-dangerous like, for example, a protein you find in berries.</p>
<p>This usually is not a problem because other cells can control the cells I just mentioned and realize they are going to attack something they should not (the substance you find in berries in our example). They stop them and put them to sleep.</p>
<p>What happens with age is that this control mechanism may not function properly, so these cells can wake up and they give you an allergy for that specific substance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m 31 and am currently covered in hives from I don’t know what. I’ve had this almost every single fucking day of my life for about 8 months now, the only thing that will get rid of the hives is steroids prescribed by drs. My lips swell up, my eyes swell shut, I scratch wounds into myself because I can’t stop itching. I’ve gone for allergy testing and they don’t know what the hell is causing it, but I can 100% genuinely say it’s agonizing at times. You wouldn’t think so but after you get to about the 6 month mark of aching joints, burning swollen skin and just generally going out of your fucking mind, you start thinking of other “solutions”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
