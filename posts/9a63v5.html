However I have also read that once there are less than 30 or so specimens of some animal species the gene pool is not big enough to carry on and they will eventually become extint (like the California vaquilla). Wouldnt that imply that for instance the lion fish in the caribean sea wouldnt have a big enough gene pool to invade that sea?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think back to school when you were asked a question “Would you rather have a penny doubled every day for 30 days or $10,000?”, and how if you chose the penny option you would get around5 million dollars. Well now say we have some 2 bugs were that just dropped in a new area, and they had 10 children. well a year passes, the first 2 bugs die, mating season began, and the 10 children had grouped into 5 pairs and had 10 kids each, totaling 50 new bugs. The next generation has 250 kids and so on. (If you remember graphs the equation would be (.5•x)•10). By the 10th generation assuming all live to reproduce you will have 19,531,250 bugs. </p>
<p>Now the most dangerous parts of inbreeding are called “recessive diseases”. Essentially if you inherit 2 parts of a bad gene from your parents you have a disease. Well say by the 7th generation these bugs start to get them, say it kills off 20% of the bugs. well at the 7th generation you have 156,250 bugs, when 20% die you are left with 125,000 bugs. now the next generation has 625,000 bugs, and by the last generation you have 10,000,000 bugs. While by the 7th generation they started losing 1/5th of the population due to inbreeding, they were still able to reproduce at a higher rate than they died.</p>
<p>What stops a lot of organisms from expanding out of control are called “limiting factors”. This can be anything from the sunlight that reaches a given area to the predator population. One of the biggest limiting factors is food and space. Say with the bugs at the 10 generation have ate too much of the food, and no longer have a stable population because they are starving. This kills more bugs until an equilibrium is established or the ecosystem collapses. Say these bugs nest and at a population of 10,000,000 there’s not enough space for all the nests and many bugs are left outside where they freeze/get a virus/eaten.</p>
<p>Now Immagine if the 10,000,000 insects had no limiting factors aside from the inbreeding, well they gotta eat, and the next generation is queued for 40 million. This puts a strain on the ecosystem and they can eat till there’s nothing left, at which point they die until an equilibrium is established.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> To answer your question in short: They do die from inbreedinf inbreeding but they have so many offspring it doesn’t matter, so it’s up to other limiting factors to essentially put up barriers to keep them from spreading. But Invasive species are frequently a problem wherever they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will take a long time for the lack of genetic diversity to wipe out a species and it's not a strict rule.  If you are dealing with an organism that breeds by the hundreds like fish or insects you'll have plenty of time to take over an ecosystem.  With fewer breeding pairs you'll have more risk to fatal mutations but every mutation isn't fatal.  Some are beneficial.</p>
<p>In species like dolphins you're talking about a highly complex animal with a relatively wide range and complex breeding.  The big problem there is getting them together to hump.  Lower life doesn't really have that problem.  Put two bugs or fish of opposite sex together and they will reproduce.  Mammals are a lot more picky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no magic number where a gene pool is too small, smaller simply means less genetic health.  If a species finds itself in an &quot;easy&quot; environment, one free of the predators and parasites it would normally encounter, that can overcome a lot of genetic limitations.</p>
<p>Also, lack of genetic diversity won't necessarily cause immediate problems.  One risk is that all the species would be vulnerable to the same kinds of diseases or parasite.  It might only be a matter of time until one strikes, but in the meantime, the species might do just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Fun fact: One reason this  (&quot;small gene pools are bad&quot;) is true is because one of the ways a species adapts to changes in its environment is that it has enough genetic variation to, over many generations, evolve and adapt to new conditions. For example, if the temperature rises a few degrees, the animal population with a varied gene pool might have some individuals who can deal with hotter days, many die, but some survive the change, and have offspring who tend to carry the genes &quot;for&quot; heat resistance, and ten thousand years later the entire population can easily survive in the hotter environment; whereas the animal population with a small gene pool might not have any individuals who can deal with hotter days, and they all die, the end. (Side note: This is also why sudden changes to an environment, even relatively long to humans but short to evolution, are bad. There is not enough time to adapt. Good thing that's not happening! *cough* *climatechange* *cough*) In other words, genetic variation helps a population survive selective pressure. One example you've probably heard of is cheetahs, which are not endangered because their population is small (although it is), they are endangered because their gene pool is small.</p>
<p>Small gene pools are also bad for other reasons, described elsewhere in this thread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
