		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an old saying that seems to hold true throughout history, and actually has been semi-proven when compared to the economic climate at the time, that shows wealthy families lose their wealth within three generations.  Obviously not ALL of them do, but a very large percentage (around 80%, from what I've seen).  Anyways, it's just curious to me why/how that happens.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Sorry guys, /r/titlegore .  &quot;ELI5: Why is the Kondratieff Cycle (<strong>AND</strong> families losing wealth within 3 generations) so accurate?</p>
<p>Was a bit tired when I asked this, so I missed a word.   Anyways, thanks for all the great answers and thoughts!  Couldn't believe I woke up and this was on the front page... You fuckers are interested in the strangest of things.  Keep on Keepin' on, Reddit!!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People do not amass wealth through hard work alone. People amass wealth through a combination of luck, favorable economic conditions, sufficient startup capital, and hard work. In order to maintain that wealth, a person must continue to have some sort of luck, favourable economic conditions, and enough extra wealth to live off of.</p>
<p>The short of it is basically that for each generation the size of the family increases. At the same time, the wealth amassed will fluctuate with gains and losses in the economy. On average, it takes 3 generations for wealth dilution and economic recession to destroy a fortune.</p>
<p>Example. You have a family with a spouse and 4 kids. You amass a fortune of $100 million dollars. On average you get 2% real gain (after inflation and taxes) and you live on $1 million a year. This means that if things continue at this rate, you will gain $1 million every year.</p>
<p>One year, your fortune takes a hit. The stock market falls, and you are left with half of your previous wealth. so you have $50 million, but you are still making 2% returns and living off of $1 million a year. 10 years later the market soars and your stocks double. You have $100 million again.</p>
<p>20 years pass, your children all get married have 4 kids and you and your wife die, leaving behind a fortune of ~122 million.</p>
<p>Now your son John has inherited $30 million. John is still making 2% return a year and his family is living off of $500,000 a year because he is more frugal. He nets about $100,000 every year. John too experiences a recession that halves his wealth. Leaving $15 million left over. Then he experiences another 10 years of 2% growth. He is still pulling $500,000 a year out to support his wife and kids. This means that he nets negative $200,000 a year. After 10 years. He has $13 million left. The stocks eventually recover and his wealth is doubled. He has $26 million, $4 million less than he started.</p>
<p>20 years pass, he dies leaves behind $28 million. His children all get married and have 4 kids.</p>
<p>John's son Ted inherits $7 million. He lives off of $140,000 that he pulls out a year plus $50,000 he makes as a teacher. His money still makes a return of 2%. The market crashes; his wealth is halved. He now has $3.5 million in investments that make only $70,000 a year. His kids go to college. Because he is still very wealthy, he receives no financial aid. It costs him $500,000. He wants to move to a cheaper house, but currently he owes more than the house is worth. He figures its cheaper to keep paying for this house that he can't afford than take the loss so he stays. 10 years later, he has $1.5 million left. The stock market recovers, and his wealth doubles to $3 million.</p>
<p>10 years later, he dies, leaving behind $1.6million to his 4 kids.  Todd and Jeff each buy a house with their inheritance. Linda and Jessica put the money toward their children's education. When Linda's oldest daughter goes to college she stays in a dorm named after her grandfather. People jokingly ask if she is related. She sheepishly says yes. People look at the used Toyota that she drives and call her a liar behind her back.</p>
<p>tl;dr Families grow at a faster rate than the return on investments minus the cost of supporting said family.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I'm getting flak for not using realistic numbers. My point is that people who are reasonably living within their means will deplete their wealth overtime because the hit taken during recessions. Using strictly realistic numbers is a lot more hassle and the point is still the same. The following is a real example, instead of the above.</p>
<p>You have 10 million. You withdraw $500k a year because you expect an annual return of 5%. A recession hits. The stock market loses 10% a year for 5 years. Then the stock market recovers. You make 22% a year for 5 years. The annual real rate of return is ~5%, but because you have been withdrawing 500,000 a year during the recession, you end up with 6.2 million over 10 years instead of  $10 million</p>
<p>The 3 examples were meant to demonstrate people spending less far less than their expected rate of return, people spending near, but less than their expected rate of return, and people spending at their rate of return. As each, person's spending approaches their expected rate of return and as each generation fractures the remaining wealth, each individuals wealth rapidly diminishes,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the particular individuals involved. It doesn't have to be about hard work or upbringing or laziness. It's just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean" target="_blank">regression to the mean</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine that there is a random process going on — for instance that you are rolling a pair of dice over and over. And whenever you roll a very high value (11 or 12 on two six-sided dice), you make a note of it ... and then you look at what value comes up next.</p>
<p>Dice do not have any memory. So when you roll a 12, <em>most of the time</em> the next value you roll will be lower than 12. Usually it will be much closer to the average value of two dice. It's not that the dice got lazy; it's that 12s are rare and that most values are less than 12.</p>
<p>Dice don't have memory, but inheritance does. You can add &quot;inheritance&quot; to the die roll by looking at moving averages — like the average of two or three rolls in a row. A high roll will pull up the moving average, but it still won't overcome regression to the mean.</p>
<p>Regression to the mean is a powerful source of confusion and bias in people's descriptions of the world. Here's another place it comes up: Suppose that you reward a student when he or she improves on a standardized test, and punish them when their scores worsen. If there is <em>random variation</em> in how well they do, then most of the time when they do unusually well (and show improvement), and you reward them, their <em>next</em> test score will be lower. And if they do unusually badly, and you punish them, their <em>next</em> score will be higher. This creates the illusion that students do badly after being rewarded and do well after being punished ... even if all that's really happening is randomness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak from my experience. I grew up in poverty while my husband grew up with mass amounts of wealth. His grandfather was a banker during the Depression in South Texas and ended up saving both his bank in a lot of people's ranches. It resulted in him gaining a lot of wealth. Then in the nineties his son had the foresight to invest in natural gas which increased their money even more.</p>
<p>My husband's mother who is in the second generation and her husband, who also grew up poor, have failed to invest the money as well as her father and her brother did. However, they haven't squandered their money and are still relatively well off. My husband and his siblings have all but squandered their share though. </p>
<p>One reason for this is that the third generation gets less money than the second generation. There is a chunk of money made from the first generation that is often lost to the second and by the time it makes it to the third it's usually smaller in scale in terms of inflation than what the second generation got from the first. So, there's less wiggle room so to speak in terms of mistakes being made that can lose the money.</p>
<p>Another reason is that by the third generation people begin to lose their sense of preservation and the understanding of how important it is to reinvestment. My husband is a fantastic guy and by no means a spoiled asshole. However, when I met him whenever there was a small want that was needed he was very quick to get it either for me or for him. They were mostly insignificant things like eating out, video games, massages, etc and since they werent large expenses like cars TVs and things like that he generally considered himself to live in relative modesty. His sister spent her trust fund almost immediately.</p>
<p>The issue of people who live in extreme wealth that I've noticed, especially in the second or 3rd generations, is that they don't comprehend that things that seem small to them are actually quite luxurious to the rest of society. So, they end up squandering a lot of money on a lot of unneeded things while thinking that they're actually quite frugal. my husband likely would have gone through his entire trust if we haven't been together. My enduring anxiety regarding money because of how I was raised has resulted in me all but closing off the trust and convincing him that we should not use it unless absolutely needed. Most of it is gone by now but there is a small amount that would allow us to do things like pay our property taxes for a couple of years. At this point it is basically a safety net if an emergency were to happen and there's almost nothing to reinvest.</p>
<p>We are very lucky to have it but what it originally was was many many times larger then what is left. I think the lack of understanding of what luxury vs frugality is in 3rd generation wealthy people is what ends up losing their money for them. The general lack of anxiety regarding money problems and everyday living expenses is what leads them to spending large amounts of money on things that are absolutely not needed.</p>
<p>Edit: holy hell using google voice to write posts makes for a very illegible response. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, which is all I know it goes like this:
1st generation works their ass off, has little time for family and amasses small fortune. Has 4 - 5 kids because they can afford to. Encourages kids to pursue lucrative careers and forgo happiness.</p>
<p>2nd generation resents 1st generation a bit for the time they didn't spend with them as kids and for encouraging them to follow money and not dreams. Later in life they decide they'd rather be happy than wealthy and decide to teach children instead of practice law. Some of the 2nd gen are (literally) crazy, have money problems and a litter of children they can't afford. 1st generation helps too much. Bails out debt, helps raise kids. Most of 2nd generation encourages kids to pursue their dreams, not wealth.</p>
<p>3rd generation pursues dreams, but are accustomed to a certain lifestyle. Money can only stretch so far in a big family. Wealth evaporates as medical expenses rise, families grow and 3rd generation earns significantly less than 1st or 2nd.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
