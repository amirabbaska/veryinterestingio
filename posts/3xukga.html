<p>Edit 3: What I have taken away from this is that there are two types of wealth. Wealth made by working and wealth made by owning things. The later are those who currently hold sway in society, this eb and flow will never really go away.  </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see all these people contributing, and I can't help but chime in with my personal experience (which, although not being in US, can contribute with some insight into this anti-union sentiment).</p>
<p>First of all, I don't believe unions are bad. It is reasonable for the workers in one company to organize and negotiate certain aspects through a common platform. That's reasonable, and I take no issue with that.</p>
<p>However, in my country, most of the unions belong to federations. The problem with this is that these unions stop representing the workers and start doing <em>what the federation tells them to</em>. What this means is that every year there is a general strike because the federations are controlled by political interests and want to get extra leverage for themselves, not for the workers. And everybody blames the workers. And that sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a Norwegian married to an American and one of the first things I noticed about her when talking about work and society was her strong negative feelings towards unions. Talking to her parents as well I realized unions have a completely different tradition and history in the US than what we are used to in Norway.</p>
<p>Unions in the US seemed confrontational and downright destructive to a company. Unions in Norway come across as much more cooperative and solution oriented than in the US. Being a union member is also a very common thing and not just some odd thing for some narrow areas of the economy.</p>
<p>I've tried to research the topic myself. I've found that the UK also has similar union traditions as the US. And I have wondered why unions seemed to have worked so much better in Nordic countries, Germany and Japan e.g.</p>
<p>A book I read called something like Democracy at work, explains it as being the result of weakness. Unions in anglo saxon countries had so little power and were culturally so far away from management that they developed an adversarial relationship. Unions in Germany and Nordic countries have been strong enough to get on company boards and take part in decision making. Thus they have taken a long term perspective rather than reacting instantly and violently when management throws something at them out of the blue. </p>
<p>I've read accounts of Norwegian companies taking over ship yards in the UK and the cultural crash. E.g. Norwegian management called in the union to participate in coming up with ideas for how to turn around the yard. Apparently this was completely unknown. The unions had never been invited to any sort of meeting like this. They were used to management being driven in a Royce Royce with their own vine cellar. They lived on different planets and were not used to being treated as equals.</p>
<p>Also unions have always been a voluntary thing here. There is no forced union membership as is common in the US. However I think the forced membership thing is a result of weakness. Starting a union in a non union company isn't that difficult in Norway. There are clear rules for how to do it and management can't fire you for doing so.</p>
<p>While in the US judging by the news I read, actively fighting the creation of a union seems like a very common tactic. Big chains like Wal Mart not having unions would have been very unusual in Norway. In fact we have had foreign chains entering Norway thinking they can run without any union presence. That usually ends very badly. Its not because unions go violent and trash your place or something silly. But it will end with so much bad publicity that your reputation will really suffer.</p>
<p>But how the whole mob union connection happened I have no idea. That also seems like a very American thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who lived through the era when unions went from &quot;good thing that everybody either belongs to or wishes they did&quot; to &quot;the villains who wrecked the economy&quot; in American public opinion, I'm seeing that all of the answers so far have left out the main reason.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in any economy: the people who make their money by working (wages, sales) and the people who make their money by owning things (landlords, shareholders, lenders). The latter group has always hated unions. Always. They divert profits and rents to workers, and that's somehow bad. But since owners are outnumbered by workers, that has never been enough to make unions and worker protection laws unpopular -- they needed something to blame the unions for. And, fairly or not (I say unfairly), the 1970s gave it to them: stagflation.</p>
<p>A perfect storm of economic and political crises hit most of the western world in the early 1970s, bringing the rare combination of high inflation (10% and up) and high unemployment (also 10% and up). Voters wanted it fixed and fixed right away, which just wasn't going to happen. After a liberal Republican and a conservative Democrat (American presidents Ford and Carter) weren't able to somehow throw a switch and fix it, Thatcher, Reagan and the conservatives came forward with a new story.</p>
<p>The American people and the British people were told that stagflation was caused by unions having too much power. The argument was that ever-rising demands for wages had created a wage-price spiral, where higher wages lead to higher prices which lead to higher wages which lead to higher prices until the whole economy teetered on the edge of collapse. They promised to break the unions if they were elected, and promised that if they were allowed to break the unions, the economy would recover. They got elected. They broke the unions. And a couple of years later, the economy recovered.</p>
<p>Ever since then the public has been told, in both countries, that if unions ever get strong again, they'll destroy the economy, just like they did back in the 1970s. Even though countries that <em>didn't</em> destroy their unions, like Germany and France and the Scandinavian  countries, recovered just as fast as we did.</p>
<p>There were anti-union stories before, but when unions were seen as the backbone of the economy, the only thing that made consumer spending even possible, nobody listened. &quot;Unions are violent!&quot; Yawn. &quot;Unions take their dues out of your paycheck!&quot; Yawn. &quot;Unions manipulate elections!&quot; Yawn. &quot;Unions are corrupt!&quot; Yawn. Nobody cared. It took convincing people that unions were bad for the whole economy to get people to turn against the unions.</p>
<p>And of course now they have another problem. Once the unions were broken, and once the stigma against scabbing was erased, once unions went from being common to be rare? Now anybody who talks about forming or joining a union instantly becomes the enemy of everybody at their workplace. It's flat-out illegal for a company to retaliate against union votes by firing the workers--but that law hasn't been enforced since 1981, so now when you talk union, <em>no matter how good your arguments,</em> your employer will tell your co-workers that if they vote for a union they'll all be fired, and <em>even though it's illegal for him to say that,</em> let alone do it, your co-workers know that he's not bluffing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unions came about as a paramilitary response to corporate abuses of people's dignity; deadly work conditions, unfair wages, a management/labor caste system that arbitrarily granted undue privilege to an undeserving few (family members of management, typically).  The rednecks in the coal mines were shot down by government troops because they went on strike for safer and fairer conditions and this pissed off the corporate owners, who were friends with the government.  Police brutality today is not the same as a bunch of skinny miners walking into machinegun fire with bolt action deer rifles.  This was in the 1920s.  Deadly force against union walkouts was too common.</p>

<p>My father was a union member in a copper mine in the southwest US, way back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  The town existed because the company built it to support the mine.  That's the original meaning of 'company town'. The store was owned by the company and practiced payday lending; advancing groceries and beer, and having the bill deducted from your pay before you ever saw it.  </p>
<p>Relevant link:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2tWwHOXMhI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2tWwHOXMhI</a></p>
<p>My family ended up there because there was work; it was the Great Depression.</p>
<p>When some equipment fell on his foot, dad went to the company hospital.  The only doctors who worked in company towns were said to be those who couldn't work anywhere else.  His toes got infected so badly that my mom could not enter his room for the smell.  When she asked for help, the staff refused.</p>
<p>As it happened, mom was a beautician, worked out of our home, and did the hair of many of the mine's managers' wives.  She went home and made some calls.  When she got back to the hospital, several doctors were attending to my dad.  In a somewhat panicked state, they asked her to never call whoever she called again.  They would guarantee my dad's good care.  None of that is fair or dignified.</p>
<p>Corporations do great good on the way up.  It is said that a rising tide lifts all boats.  Unions do great good on the way up, too.  Both fall ill when they get to be huge and take on a life of their own.  </p>
<p>We have learned.  I'm not sure how much we've learned, but we are better off than in my father's time in the mines.  Unions representing labor can be a wonderful thing for everyone, but so can arbitration, focus groups from the shop floor, quality circles, and a host of other management styles.  Unions can also be a pox over everyone's head.  </p>
<p>What I have learned across this lifetime is that what worked in the past is not guaranteed to work in the future, not for labor, not for management, not for politicians.  Not for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>8 year member of a union here, unions like any other organization can be mismanaged. That being said, protecting union rights is incredibly important for the working class. I am disheartened to see people turn against their best interest. I feel that the 2 party system in America influences people to align their opinions with one of the 2 political parties instead of rationally thinking each individual issue through. For example, I live and work in southwest Ohio and the majority of the population here are staunch conservatives. Therefore, most of my union brothers and sisters advocate for Republican candidates and espouse anti-union views.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
