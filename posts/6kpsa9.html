		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the one answer about engaging in &quot;play which builds muscle and muscle memory&quot; the answer is most likely &quot;no&quot;. Exercise for the sake of exercise burns up a lot of calories which in other animals is best preserved for acquiring food and reproducing etc. That humans engage in muscle building is a result of our societal evolution from that of hunter gatherers where we were just like other animals to today where division of labor has made food acquisition the least of our worries. So, we now have plenty of time and resources to waste working out to impress people (or most likely ourselves). When you look at the very few truly tribal societies still in existence today, you won't find too many people working out for the sake of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Any animal engages in behaviors to increase the size and responsiveness of their muscles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're looking for the human definition, that's tied to social displays, you could certainly look at male kangaroos and try to determine how much of their mass comes from behaviors they share with females, and those they engage in excess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birds.  Birds practice their mating dances.  They develop and practice a range of moves that requires a range of muscles.  They practice those moves to build their muscles for a display quite similar in intent to many humans who work out.</p>
</li>
<li>If you're trying to determine the &quot;classes&quot; of animals that do a particular behavior, you're going to have a lot of trouble observing nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even amoebas gotta stretch their sacks, holmes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question conflates two levels of 'purpose'.</p>
<p>One is a <strong>subjective</strong> meaning of purpose - what motivates you to play or build muscle (having fun, feeling attractive...)?</p>
<p>Another is an <strong>ulterior</strong> meaning of purpose - which mechanisms programmed people or animals to have fun or feel attractive when they play or build muscle (fight/flight training, social/sexual status)?</p>
<p>OP uses human muscle building as an example of an activity that exists 'for the sole purpose of muscle growth'.</p>
<p>If you interpret 'purpose' in the <strong>subjective</strong> sense, the example ignores any indirect, personal motivation someone might have for wanting to build muscle. That doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>If you interpret 'purpose' in the <strong>ulterior</strong> sense, the example ignores any indirect, ulterior reasons why people would want to 'instinctively' feel motivated to build muscle. That doesn't seem right either.</p>
<p>I think OP is looking for animal behavior that seems to solely build muscle (and not e.g. social relations) <em>while the animal is doing it</em>.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are examples of this on a small scale, but I can't think of another animal that systematically builds muscle while not also playing/hunting/looking for mates/travelling etc.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is pretty intuitive: Whatever your ulterior reason for building muscle, you're usually better off doing <strong>that</strong> instead of 'building your muscles' separately. Or, at the very least, you should combine your muscle building with activities that bring about other benefits while you're doing them.</p>
<p>Muscles are expensive to build and maintain, and it's much more efficient to have the work required to build them achieve other goals while you're building them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
