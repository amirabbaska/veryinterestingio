		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A family friend of ours sells luxury watches, and as you would imagine, most disgustingly rich people don't stand in line at a store, ever. He sells most of the watches one on one, he brings a locking brief case with a few watches that the customer may like/have already selected to the folks' home, yacht, futbol game, jet ride to the next futbol game, wherever they want to throw around some money. The storefront is just there for the commonfolk, like us. The real money doesn't stand in line. Ever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They go up in price with age, He did not have to pay taxes on his earnings. and he kept them in a safe deposit box in a bank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What others have said about the profit margins is true, but the fact is a <em>lot</em> of people buy luxury watches. They're not mass market, sure, but in many professions they're the most obvious wearable male accessory. </p>
<p>Especially when you talk about fields like financial advice, personal banking, and finance in general, wearing a luxury watch demonstrates to your clients that you are a successful professional who can be trusted with their money. Outside the financial/sales sector its often a symbol of professional/life achievement. Hell, I'm a teacher and I saved up for a Rolex for the birth of my first child (and am looking at a JLC reverso for my second). </p>
<p>Even beyond that a mechanical watch is a superb piece of analog technology, and a lot of people like the feel of them beyond their nature as a status symbol. They're lovely little machines, and, like being a &quot;car guy&quot; a lot of guys become &quot;watch guys&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: Just to add on, in a world where luxury is increasingly disposable (eg top end tech accessories are only top end for a year or so, high fashion changes very drastically from season to season, luxury cars lose their value unless you put a <em>lot</em> of work into maintaining them to the point they become classics), a luxury watch is the one remaining status symbol which <em>lasts</em>. I know my Rolex will outlast me. It's just a Submariner, but I spent close to 14k USD on it (rough conversion from Singapore dollars), and I <em>know</em> it'll outlive me if taken care of. Patek Philippe (which of course is light years beyond a mere Rolex) specifically uses this as their tagline- &quot;You never own a Patek Philippe, you just take care of it for the next generation&quot;. It applies to any of the classically manufactured high end watches. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
