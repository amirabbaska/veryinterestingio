		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it hurts even when the drink went down the &quot;right&quot; tube.</p>
<p>This happens most often with carbonated drinks. The lower pressure outside of the can/bottle and the heat of your body makes carbon dioxide to come out of the soda/pop/coke as you drink it. This is what causes the fizzling effect. It's cool and tasty as long as it happens in your mouth.</p>
<p>But what if the fizzling keeps going on after you've swallowed? Your esophagus was preparing to handle an ounce of liquid, but suddenly it has an ounce of liquid <em>and</em> a large volume of gas in it. It's as if you swallowed a deflated balloon and it somehow inflated itself while you were swallowing it! This causes painful stretching of the esophagus.</p>
<p>[Edit] Obviously, this is more likely to happen when the drink hasn't had enough time to fizzle out before you swallow, like when you drink straight out of a freshly opened, cold can on a hot summer day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For background, I'm a 4th year resident in otolaryngology, so this is right up my alley. To first understand your question more clearly, let's define a few things. </p>
<p>Dysphasia: dysfunction of swallow
Odynophagia: pain with swallow
Aspiration: food/liquid/saliva entering your trachea</p>
<p>Aspiration occurs when you have some type of dysfunction of your larynx (structure composed of and supporting vocal cords that elevates during swallow) and epiglottis (cartilage flap that closes over your larynx to protect airway when swallowing). Aspiration cause you to cough. Typically is not painful. This is what happens when people say &quot;it went down the wrong pipe.&quot; It can become an issue when it leads to aspiration pneumonia. Older folks and smokers (or other individuals whose lungs and windpipe cannot optimally clear mucus) can develop an infection of the lungs if bacteria continues to enter this area and is not cleared properly. </p>
<p>Dysphasia can be divided up into a few different categories. </p>
<p>Oral - involving the mouth, all voluntary muscle movement. Thing of someone with a paralyzed tongue trying to push a food bolus to the back of their mouth. Very difficult. </p>
<p>Oropharyngeal - a combination of voluntary and involuntary muscle movement. This phase of swallowing is basically your active swallow initiation motion followed by involuntary motion of pharyngeal muscles. Elderly with weak pharyngeal muscles, or someone who has suffered a stroke affecting this area. Additionally, at this stage, if the epiglottis fails to descend properly, aspiration can occur.</p>
<p>Esophageal - completely involuntary muscle movement. Dysphasia in this phase can be functional or mechanical. Mechanical occurs if there is some type of obstruction in the esophagus, like a ring, web, or tumor. This type of dysphasia occurs mainly with solid food and not liquid. Functional dysphagia occurs if there is some type of improper muscle motion, like lower esophageal sphincter spasm or diffuse esophageal spasm. It occurs with solid and liquid. Basically there is either a physiologic miscommunication among the nerves or a chronic problem. </p>
<p>All these types of dysphagia can present with pain in different areas based on the location of the dysfunction. Typically in the morning, a short lived cramp/pain with swallowing is likely due to an esophageal spasm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, your esophagus works in tandem with your mouth to time when it needs to start contracting and relaxing to move food into your stomach. Think of this action like moving a bead from the bottom of your toothpaste container to the opening using both hands instead of one.</p>
<p>When you swallow &quot;wrong&quot;, you might grab some air instead of the soda at first, which causes some uncomfortable pressure on your esophagus as it moves the air down into your stomach ahead of the beverage.</p>
<p>Ever notice you can give pretty rad burps after swallowing &quot;wrong&quot; like that, too?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of misinformation in this thread...</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with water going down the wrong tube. What happens is that when you normally swallow, you initiate a series of muscular contractions in your throat all the way down to your lower esophageal sphincter. These contractions will normally work to push food/drink down the esophagus into the stomach (this is why you can swallow upside down and not have food/water come out of your mouth). Think of squeezing a pea out of a straw to visualize how it works.</p>
<p>When you &quot;swallow wrong&quot;, what happens is that the muscle contractions, instead of taking place right above the bolus to push it down, actually takes place at the bolus, causing pain as the muscles squeeze the bolus, instead of pushing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
