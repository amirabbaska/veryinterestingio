		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently studying some advanced economics, we call what other responders call &quot;social democracy&quot; a <em>&quot;mixed economy&quot;</em> and it's comparable to a Socialism Lite™. Unlike an economy such as the US where healthcare and prisons generate profit, an economic system like Canada's and some European countries is helpful, where healthcare is still paid for by the government but doesn't exactly need to make profit, because healthcare is for sick people to get better, not for money. While Socialism, and in turn Communism would compare more to what's called a &quot;planned economy&quot; with following countries like Cuba, and Venezuela, with strict food rations, giving all people basic needs without even thinking about profit.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Social democracy is Socialism Lite™, think Canada and Nordic Countries vs. Venezuela and Cuba</p>
<p>EDIT: the former being social democracy and the latter being socialism </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production and the <del>results of those means are collectively</del> owned by the community in some way or another - compared to capitalism where the means can be privately owned. Social democracy is a political/government system that seeks to create an equitable society within the framework of capitalism and representative democracy. This means the &quot;means of production&quot; can stay privately owned but the government intervenes where necessary to ensure fair competition, protection of workers rights, economic protection and support for the poor, things like that. There are varying flavors of it, some more socialist than others but key difference is that socialism is an economic system whereas social democracies are governments that enact some mixture of socialist and capitalist policies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL/DR; Capitalism + Socialism = Social Democracy. The difference between Socialism and Social Democracy is that Social Democracy has some features of capitalism (such as private ownership of factories).</p>
<hr />
<p>In Capitalism, when you go to work in a factory and make cars you do not own the cars that you are building. You are adding value to raw metals by shaping and assembling them, the car would not exist without your skill/time/labor, but you have no ownership of your work. You have no rights to the product of the factory because you are 'selling' your ownership of the product for 'wages.' The factory owner does no labor, but they own all the cars that you build and so they keep all the profits from sales and negotiate with you, separately, what your 'wages' should be.</p>
<p>In theory, the owners of factories will grow exceptionally rich and will be able to use that wealth to benefit society.</p>
<p>In Socialism, a person cannot own a factory because a factory requires many people in order to function. There may be managers who give directions, but there is no capitalist who simply reaps benefits from other people's work. In socialism, if you work in a factory then you own the thing you make. If many people help make a car, they share ownership of the car. When the car is sold, all workers share the profit equally with no money being siphoned off by landlords or factory owners. The money is also shared with society because society helps build that car (teachers, ditch diggers, and surfers are part of the economy that supports your industry).</p>
<p>In theory, socialism redistributes the wealth so that there is no economic inequality in society.</p>
<p>Socialism and Capitalism are <em>nearly opposite</em> economy policies. A social democracy is a <em>hybrid of capitalism and socialism,</em> with a few features of each of the extremes.</p>
<p>Social Democracy is capitalism. However, SD disagrees with Capitalism because it aims to prevent money from (overly) concentrating in the hands of elites. SD forces a (small) redistribution of wealth in order to keep the economy stable, such as universal health care or social security. SD says that governments should step in to make sure that privately owned businesses are not harming society or workers - so regulations, taxes, and bail-outs are acceptable government tools (BONUS: this is one reason the GOP hated Obama).</p>
<p>Social Democracy is socialism. However, SD disagrees with Socialism because it acknowledges private ownership of production and a limited role of government regulation. SD allows for inequality to exist within the economy, and only steps in when the inequality is dysfunctional or extreme. SD also fails to recognize the contributions of all of society so when income is redistributed it is not distributed equally to everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
