		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gangstalking is a particular manifestation of paranoid schizophrenia.  Specifically, that &quot;everybody is out to get me&quot;.</p>
<p>The internet has enabled paranoid schizophrenics to network, sharing and reinforcing their delusion.  This has resulted in a fairly standardized presentation with shared terminology and perceived tactics.</p>
<p>The &quot;targets&quot; of gangstalking believe that they are the target of a <em>vast</em> conspiracy.  So vast that literally every person they see or talk to is a member.  This conspiracy expends vast amounts of time and money to, say, beam intrusive thoughts into their heads with top secret technology; frame them for crimes; break into their homes to tamper with things; and generally annoy them in extremely petty ways.  For example, it's common to believe that multiple people will pass them, each saying one syllable of a slur.</p>
<p>Here's a &quot;comic&quot; that explains gangstalking from the perspective of a victim:  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/timirrors/targ" target="_blank">Targ the Target</a>.  Edit: Because a lot of people have been confused, I want to be clear.  <em>Targ the Target</em> is not a parody or a description of the condition from the outside.  It's written by a woman who suffers from the delusion, and is 100% serious.  Targ appears to be a composite of herself and other sufferers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I have an acquaintance who is posting about gang stalking on Facebook, and I'm wondering what I should do. He's unfriended all his real friends due to them &quot;being part of the street theatre&quot; , so I'm kinda the only one left. How do I tell someone that his posts are signs of paranoid schizophrenia and that he needs help, without making him think I'm part of the conspiracy?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gangstalking is when a group of people stalk an individual.</p>
<p>Probably, someone at some point has actually been gangstalked.</p>
<p>But most people who think they're being gangstalked are actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/health/gang-stalking-targeted-individuals.html" target="_blank">experiencing symptoms of a mental illness</a>, like paranoid schizophrenia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Last Podcast on the Left has a really good episode on it. Basically the idea is that you get a lot of people to do a variety of things to make it seem like everyone's out to get you. The goal is to make you look/feel crazy. It can be done in a variety of ways like individuals following you, groups of people not-so-subtly whispering about you, etc. The entire point is that it's a lot of people involved. When it comes to fact vs. fiction, well, what's more likely: there's a conspiracy to make you look crazy or that you're just paranoid?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's taking turns to harass a thing until it wears them down, but because you're taking turns you don't get worn down.
