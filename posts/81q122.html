		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few factors.</p>
<p>Firstly, children don't have an upper limit on how sweet a food they'll eat. Finding sweet food sickly isn't something developed until adulthood. Apparently this has something to do with bone growth.</p>
<p>Secondly, children have a lot more taste buds than adults. We lose taste buds as we age.</p>
<p>Thirdly, children are much more sensitive to bitter foods than adults, beyond simply having more taste buds. This is thought to be an defense against accidental poisoning.</p>
<p>All of these add up to children having no reason to dislike sweets, and more reasons to dislike other flavours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;A study conducted by the University of Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, comparing young male subjects between the ages of eight and 10 to adult males found that the adolescents had a higher anterior papillae density than the adults, making them more sensitive to sucrose or sweet flavors.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't find the study, but I recall something about children having no limit on what's too sweet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small children are among one of the highest energy expending creatures in the universe. They're always running around, screaming, picking their noses, and putting spaghetti on their cat's head.</p>
<p>The only sustainable fuel sources for a creature like that, short of nuclear fusion, is sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, and red dye number 41</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the opposite end, elderly people tend to prefer sweeter foods as tasting capability is diminished with age. This is especially evident in dementia and Alzheimer’s patients. Many of these patients refuse to eat anything other than desserts. I’ve spoken to several members of the care staff at a local skilled nursing center and they will often add sugar to foods to encourage the residents to eat their meals. Overall perhaps not the best option diet-wise, but at a certain point you just try to maximize day to day functioning over long term effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
