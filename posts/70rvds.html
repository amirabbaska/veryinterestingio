		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food allergies are often caused by an allergic response to a protein. Proteins are very large molecules made out a long chain of chemical groups called &quot;amino acids.&quot; These chains are &quot;crumpled up&quot; into a 3D shape, and the exact 3D shape is what the body recognizes as an allergen. If the protein is unfolded, then the body may no longer recognize it. If a protein is exposed to heat or to acidic conditions, like they would in the pickling process, it can unfold and lose its 3D shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three options for this.</p>
<p>1) Allergic reactions are generally a response from our immune system to certain proteins. Proteins are 3D structures that living organism use for stability, to speed up chemical reactions, store energy, and a variety of other things. Some parts of that 3D structure is unique to certain proteins, and our body uses it to recognize proteins from organisms that could be dangerous to us (e.g. an aggressive bacteria. Sometimes the body misidentifies something innocuous as harmful, and the reaction triggers when it detects it. Those are allergies. But notice that the allergy is specific to the specific 3-D structure of the protein, which is what's detected. Now, heating or exposing proteins to acidic environments can change their structure, sometimes irreversibly. It's possible that this person had an allergy to one of the proteins in cucumbers that change conformation when you pickle them. So that specific conformation of a cucumber protein is not there in pickles. This, however, would be dangerous: it is hard to guarantee that all of the proteins they're allergic to would have changed conformation, so if their allergy is strong, they could still have a reaction if the pickling process was incomplete, for example with a thicker slice.</p>
<p>2) A certain number of allergic reactions seem to be related to our interpretation of what we are eating. There are for example descriptions of people having allergic reactions when they knew that they were being exposed, but not when they didn't know. This does not mean that the reaction is &quot;fake&quot;, though. This can be a very real allergic reaction, with very real symptoms (hives, inflammation, etc.). But it's triggered in combination with the knowledge of being exposed. It's possible that this is the type of allergy this person has, and it's only associated to cucumbers and not pickles.</p>
<p>3) What I described before is the classical pathway for allergies (usually with skin symptoms or swelling). However, people often call &quot;allergies&quot; to basically any adverse reaction. This sometimes includes for example stomach upset. Now, that process is different, and is generally not based on an immune response. We have a way to detect what foods may be toxic using our smell. If we associate a certain smell with a stomach upset (e.g. because we ate a lot of something and then felt sick), we will then feel sick and want to vomit (take out the substance from our bodies) based on that smell, particularly if we eat it. If this is what this person has, and the smell of pickles and cucumbers is different enough to them that they associate cucumbers but not pickles, they may be able to eat pickles. This is the least likely explanation because this would not generate hives or skin reactions, which it seems this person has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A person claiming a &quot;severe allergy&quot; however is likely overstating their reaction or telling you in roundabout terms that they don't like the taste of cucumbers.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
