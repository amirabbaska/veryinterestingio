		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, they don't grow meat in labs on a large scale, although it's currently being researched.</p>
<p>In the same way that you can grow bacteria in petri dishes, you can also grow animal cells in flasks filled with nutrient-rich liquid (media). Generally, the cells will stick to the bottom of the flask as they grow. The trick with growing tissues (meat is just muscle tissue) is that you have to grow the right type of cells and you have to get the cells to organize into that tissue. Research is focused mostly on which chemical signals the cells need to organize into the tissue and what sort of structure they need to grow on.</p>
<p>As the cells grow they get all of their food from the liquid media, so if you want to grow pounds of meat you will have to replace the media a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually we all start out as a lump of cells when we were still an embryo. When cells divide, you will grow in size and your cells will start to specialize in certain functions (for example skin cells can absorb sunlight). Thus by absorbing enough nutrients, the lump of cells can divide and grow into a human.</p>
<p>Now if you want to grow meat, the process is more complex. Main problem is that the cells will try to specialize into a task. So you add drugs to stop the process. Also your Petri dish will run out of nutrients as the cells kept dividing non-stop, thus it will be better if you use an entire tank of cell culture instead. Just keep refilling the tank until the meat is ready.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though this is VERY expensive. Controlling the enviroment (temperature, pressure......) is not easy and it cost at least $10000 for a pound of lab grown meat. Most meat we eat today are just animals kept in farms (most likely GM for more meat), which is cheaper and safer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting muscle cells to grow is a solved problem at this point. The obstacle to industrial-scale production is a circulatory system. In a living being, blood brings oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products. There is an upper limit to the volume of tissue that can be maintained solely by 'diffusion'. Very small animals like insects can survive without hearts or lungs because none of their tissues are very 'deep'. </p>
<p>It's possible to grow tissue with veins in it, but then it would need to be hooked up to a mechanical or organic pump and use real blood or a blood substitute. </p>
<p>The last I time I saw anything was a story that said they had been able to produce enough meat to make a single hamburger. Presumable that was because they made lots of small bits of tissue and when ground up, it was exactly equivalent ground beef. Something like boneless hams or turkey should be pretty easy because those things are basically glued-together bits of meat anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About a year ago I listened to a podcast by Sam Harris and he was talking to the CEO of a company called Memphis Meats, who are trying to find a way to mass produced cultured meats. They talk a bit about the science and the rationale behind why they would try such a thing. The Podcast is &quot;Waking Up&quot; by Sam Harris and episode is called &quot;Meat without Misery&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lab grown meet is grown from cow stem cell. The article I read used stem cells from the shoulder of the cow. They put the stem cells in a petri dish and then provided the correct amount of nutrients needed into the dish with the stem cells. The cells then begin to make exact (some mutation occurs but it's negligible) copy's of themselves exponentially. </p>
<p>So the cells gain 'weight' by outside input by the scientists. The problem with lab grown meat right now is that the cells are exact copies. They don't have the order and structure that a muscle in a real cow has. They also lack fat. Fat is what gives meat its flavor. This lack of order, structure, and fat leads to a very strange and unappetizing texture of the meat. </p>
<p>I'd recommend reading this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/lab-grown-meat-is-in-your-future-and-it-may-be-healthier-than-the-real-stuff/2016/05/02/aa893f34-e630-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html?utm_term=.9ef046276c9b" target="_blank">article</a> on lab grown meat.</p>
<p>EDIT: keeping up with demand is currently not possible with lab grown meat alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
