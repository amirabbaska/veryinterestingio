		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that the answer you're looking for exists as of yet. You're looking for a detailed description of the plateau phase of the sexual response cycle, but as far as I know this is only described in terms of &quot;outward&quot; signs such as blood pressure, respiration, muscle contractions and so on. I believe you're looking for what part of the brain tells the body to orgasm, but I don't have that answer. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can chime in. This is what I do know: </p>
<p>First, as female orgasm is rare among mammal species, assume that male orgasm is the norm. As a consequence, assume that orgasms evolved for the purpose of semen delivery and that any other uses are secondary.</p>
<p>Further, note that semen delivery can happen without actual orgasm. Prostate &quot;milking&quot; is the process of massaging the prostate (which is reachable through the anus) to induce ejaculation. This is used in animal husbandry.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, know that how orgasms work are a matter of controversy, so everything in this comment should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The idea here is that the evolutionary pressure for males to be able to ejaculate at the right moment is so intense that nerves and organs for making it happen are part of the primordial mammal. This would be my preferred explanation to why many females have the equipment necessary for having orgasms. Similarly, nipples are so critical for mammals that they develop before sexual differentiation, so that both males and females have nipples. My argument is that orgasms in males are an evolutionary adaptation, but that orgasms in females are not, which is a highly disputed position and should not be taken as fact.</p>
<p>So, what is an orgasm then? Apart from a rush of pleasure, orgasms are accompanied by the following physical reactions (in human males and females as well as relevant non-human primates):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rhythmic contractions of various muscles, including the <em>vas deferens</em> in males and the <em>orgasmic platform</em> in females.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The O face, a rounding of the lips, sometimes accompanied by vocalizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A clutching reaction with the hands, often towards or of the partner.</p>
</li>
<li>Turning towards the partner to look at them during orgasm.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these reactions, we can tell that the systems around orgasm is more complex than simple semen delivery. The fact that females turn to their partner, even in some non-human primate species where orgasm is not observed in the wild, is fascinating. (That is, females would turn to the human that was giving them orgasm and stare at their face.) ^Burton ^1971, ^Allen ^and ^Lemmon ^1981</p>
<p>From all of this we can assume that pleasure itself is not what causes orgasm, but rather that pleasure is there to signify a major positive event. It is perhaps there to tell you &quot;this is when you got Lisa pregnant&quot;, and &quot;look at her, remember her face you buffoon&quot;.</p>
<p>The act of sex itself is associated with the release of oxytocin, which is a hormone involved in creating and maintaining long-term memories, and often described as the &quot;love hormone&quot;.</p>
<p>Because several systems are at work, there is likely not a single trigger for orgasm. Some people can achieve orgasm without any physical stimulation. Others can achieve a rush of pleasure without ejaculation. These high levels of control are anomalies but hint that orgasms are in fact multiple events that happen in concert. But the basic outline is that orgasms follow this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Excitement, which may include both physical and psychological triggers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plateau, in which urethral muscles prepare for orgasm, but orgasm can still be canceled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orgasm, as given by the descriptors above</p>
</li>
<li>Resolution, with release of involved muscles</li>
</ol>
<p>As stated above, to really answer your question, a neurological investigation of the plateau phase is needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orgasm is part of the autonomic response system..same system that controls hiccups, sneezing, and vomitting among others. When nerve endings send signals to your brain, they trigger cascades of certain neurotransmitters that, when there is enough, trigger the appropriate response along a pathway connected through the vagus nerve and into the medulla oblongata segment of the brain, and then back out to the area of the body where a response is required.</p>
<p>In the case of sneezing, particles of dust brush the hairs in your nose that trigger signals to the brain, and eventually lead to a sneeze response to clear the dust. </p>
<p>In the case of vomitting, a toxin will cause a chemical reaction in the gut that eventually leads to a vomit response to rid the body of the toxin. </p>
<p>The case of orgasm, the stimulation of nerves in erogenous zones trigger an ejaculation response in males, and a cervical convulsion in females to aid sperm entering egg.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The male orgasm actually has two stages: emission and expulsion. In emission, there are contractions in the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and the prostate gland. This is felt to be the point of no return.  After that stage you have the expulsion, which is when the semen actually comes out of you! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
