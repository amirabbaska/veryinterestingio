		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This'll get buried, but this is my only real area of expertise.</p>
<p>The top answers here are all pointing at health insurance companies, which is sort of right-ish, but not for the reasons they say.  There are other counties with private insurance that don't have our problems.  Most countries, in fact, have some private companies that offer supplemental plans beyond government ones.</p>
<p>The central issue is <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/3/89.full" target="_blank">how prices are set in the united states</a>.  You could just go google Uwe Reinhardt articles and he'll say it better than me. </p>
<p>Quick terminology primer: payer = who pays the doctor's bill.  this can be an individual, the government or a commercial insurance company.  provider = the one providing the care.  doctors and/or hospitals.</p>
<p>In virtually every OECD nation, prices are set centrally.  Whether there's full government ownership of the healthcare system (e.g. in france most hospitals are owned by the government) or just a single payer system (hospitals and other providers remain independently owned).  The incentives centralized pricing creates are exactly what you want:  providers do things efficiently enough to make a profit, take a loss on that business, or stop performing a procedure and refer patients elsewhere.  The government can tweak the reimbursement rates in order to adjust how the system performs.  If colonoscopies turn out to be a waste of money because they're ineffective, you lower the reimbursement rates and doctors stop doing them.</p>
<p>That's not how it works in the United States.  Here, we have literally thousands of different prices for any given procedure.  Simplifying things quite a bit, there's a government rate (medicare) which is fixed by CMS. This rate is significantly lower than what a commercial insurance company would pay the provider. </p>
<p>Prices for commercial plans are all set in secret negotiations between providers and payers.  The price paid by a commercial plan is based on the relative market strength of the payer and the provider.  </p>
<p>If it's a big insurance company with 75% market share negotiating a rate with a small provider with 5% market share, they can negotiate a low rate because that provider NEEDS to be able to accept patients with that insurance plan or they'll go out of business.  </p>
<p>If it's a small insurance company with 5% share negotiating with a huge provider, the provider calls the shots and can negotiate a high reimbursement rate.  The insurance company needs to be able to send patients to Big Brand Name Hospital because otherwise nobody is going to sign up for this plan.</p>
<p>This creates HORRIBLE incentives.  Hospitals don't need to be efficient if they can get a lot of money out of insurance companies.  The way to improve your negotiating position is by having a gigantic patient base, providing a lot of extremely high-tech services that people demand, by marketing the hell out of yourself, etc.  If I'm running a hospital and have to choose whether to invest $100M on improving efficiency or $100M in building/buying a facility in a new market, I'm not going to spend it on efficiency improvements.  </p>
<p>There's one state (<a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/5/1395.full" target="_blank">Maryland</a>) where inpatient reimbursement rates are flat and tied to medicare rates across all payers.  Private insurance companies pay exactly what the government does.  This required special legislation, but guess who has had the lowest increase in inpatient costs in the nation in the last 20+ years?</p>
<p>There's a lot more going on than this, but most of it eventually comes back to how payment/pricing works.  That's the biggest difference between the USA and most of the rest of the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Canadian married to an American so I do have some perspective on the issues, because there are multiple reasons. </p>
<p>1 - Fear. The average American is terrified of anything messing with whatever &quot;plan&quot; they have chosen. </p>
<p>2 - Distrust of Government. As a canadian I think that government's job is to provide a protective role between the people and corporations and our baser instincts of greed etc. They do so by passing laws that protect the people who are in a very inequitable position to defend themselves. A whole swath of America thinks that the government should just go. </p>
<p>3 - Propaganda I have seen over and over again in thread like these people come and say ridiculous statements like &quot;Canadians are coming to the USA to get health treatment because it's so good&quot; like the exception makes the rule. Or Canadians have to wait so long for health care. `The truth is that for the vast majority of people especially the indigent and middle class, you are so much better off anywhere with socialized health care. Yes sure if you're part of the 1% you'll be fine, but you'd be fine anywhere. </p>
<p>4-American Exceptionalism (More propaganda) Many Americans are completely convinced that America is the best country in the world. Truth is they just make this very general statement but what is America best at? Sardine fishing? (No) Clown schools? (No) Italian cuisine (Hell no) What the fuck does that statement even mean? The rest of the world (some of whom actually love their countries) just don't even at this statement. So one statement I have heard is that America also has the best health care in the world and if you look at certain hospitals who do research and specialized medicine that may well be true in part, but you &quot;Average American&quot; will never set foot in the hallowed halls of those places. </p>
<p>5- Health Care is a human right. This is how other countries look at health care. We all gladly pay so that we are all protected cradle to grave and it's cheap. For instance my no deductible, no co-pay plan costs us on a sliding scale a maximum of $900 per year. <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/data/ontario-health-premium-rates" target="_blank">https://www.ontario.ca/data/ontario-health-premium-rates</a>. My 70 year old mother in law pays more than that for her Medicaid top up. My husband when he first came here had no health coverage, and he got really good free checkups from a community health center and no it wasn't overrun. We all believe that we should all be taken care of and healthy and that we will pay for other people. Illness is the great equalizer. </p>
<p>6-The major reason that health care is expensive is that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people that work at the hospital processing insurance, at the insurance company denying claims, staff at the hospital to collect cash payments, checks, billing, accounting. For the most part, those people do not exist here. In fact, one time I was in ER because I had a foot infection and was getting IV antibiotics, and this American guy came in and broke his arm, he had an X-ray and a cast and Dr. care. So it came time to pay and no one could accept his payment, the nurse literally didn't know what to do. They charged him $375 and then they told him to sit by the door lol. They had to go upstairs and find out how much to charge, and how to accept payment. The guy had cash so they finally just found a paper and wrote a receipt on that. It took longer to take the money than to treat his arm. </p>
<p>7-You don't ask for it. Because you've been told that socialized medicine is bad, you don't demand it. If the government took away our socialized medicine here in Canada, we would draw and quarter the responsible people. No politicians dare fuck with health care because it would be political suicide. The End. </p>
<p>Imagine a world where the Dr doesn't care how much to charge and you can go to any hospital or Dr and they are on your plan. Your Dr has one goal, to treat your condition. Imagine never having to wait for your new job coverage to kick in, or even deal with preexisting conditions. No one goes bankrupt because of medical debt and in fact it doesn't exist, unless you take a loan for your boob job or botox. It's really nice. You should try it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Health insurance companies. I do billing for offices and let me tell you that health insurance companies only exist to make money as the middle man. </p>
<p>Let's say you and your employer pay $2000 a month to an insurance company to have decent coverage for a family. Well most likely you will still have a deductible/coinsurance/copay on top of that premium. If your family is relatively healthy (which if you think about it the majority of people are) then you have paid over $24000 for one year and let's say for argument sake less than $2000 in health services.</p>
<p>And not only that but the insurance companies are contracted with your health care providers to pay the lowest rate they can. So what your doctor actually bills out is much higher than the actual cost. Therefore someone without insurance can be screwed even if they can get some kind of discount through their provider. I personally find it all insane. The amount of rules, red tape, delay and bullshit insurance companies cause I believe is a major factor in why our health care system doesn't work as well as it could. They basically control the patients and providers.   </p>
<p>Edit: This has way more responses than I expected. I'm not saying insurance companies are the only factor, but they are a huge part and to say otherwise makes me believe you either work for one or have never dealt with them. There's many problems with the current system and I believe it comes down to it being a for profit system. I don't believe it's doctors that are the greedy ones. They deserve to be well compensated for the amount of school and work they have done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born-Canadian here, who has lived, worked, paid taxes and used healthcare in the US (as well as Canada and European countries)....And I think it's just a cash-grab..although Population plays a big part in why they are &quot;justified&quot; in charging more. Healthcare for 350 Million is different than 35 Million.</p>
<p>We have Health Insurance in Canada. We use it to help pay for medications and emergencies...But why does the same medication cost Three times as much in America?
I have a canadian plan similar to HMO/PPO plans in the US, where coverage is 90% and co-pay is 10%...But the cost of the meds is waaaayyy less in Canada.
There's many other fees that people don't discuss either...I paid $50 each time I visited my doc, that wasn't covered by insurance..What's that fee for??
My infant daughter needed to visit Emergency once in California...X-rays, medications, blood tests, etc...Ended up costing me Thousands.
Shortly after, I returned to Canada and have taken her to countless doctors, hospitals, specialists and haven't paid a dime to any of them!</p>
<p>The American healthcare system is poorly designed, because the people who need it most (kids, seniors, veterans, disabled people, etc.) are the ones who can't afford the help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Health insurance is the single ELI5 answer to this question. We have a multi-billion dollar industry standing between ourselves and our health care. The insurance industry making more money for everyone except the person who is sick and the millions that will never get sick.</p>
<p>With insurance, there became a financial disconnect between the doctor and the patient.  Health care providers were able to charge the insurance companies a higher rate then the individual patient could afford. And of course, the patient seeing nothing but the benefit of not having to pay that high bill basically became a product to be bought and sold by these two entities.</p>
<p>The absolute best thing we could do as a country is dismantle the health insurance industry and return to patient/doctor relationships.  The next best thing we could do is close down the VA and expand Medicaid to every single American by default funded by a large increase in the SS tax and allow those with the money to augment their coverage with those golden plans everyone wants.</p>
<p>Thanks for the gold stranger. I'm going to trade it for some health care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
