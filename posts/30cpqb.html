		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read some articles about it and this is my best shot at explaining.</p>
<p>You know we have two theories about how the universe works: Relativity, which deals with things that have very large energies and mass (both are the same thing according to relativity) and quantum mechanics, which deals with things in the atomic and subatomic scale. </p>
<p>Both are, as far as we can detect, right. When you work the math and design an experiment, they are correct to an astounding precision. However, there's a problem: the math for both don't check together – when trying to mash both, some nonsensical terms appear. This means that we don't have a working theory for things that are both incredibly tiny and very massive so many (most? all?) scientists believe there's some extra term or correction to one or both the theories, or that they need to be replaced by a more advanced theory in the same way relativity replaced Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Rainbow gravity is one of such corrections. Standard relativity says that energy is affected equally by gravitational fields. This correction says that it doesn't, gravity affects different wavelenghts of light -or colors- somewhat like a prism creates a rainbow. This should be detectable with very sentitive instruments from bursts of very powerful radiation called gamma ray bursts that pass nearby to large masses.</p>
<p>Continuing to what we were talking before, one of those instances where you had very small and very massive things was the big bang. We have a very good idea of what happened very, very shortly after &quot;moment zero&quot;, so the Rainbow Gravity theory doesn't change that – the age of the universe after the initial expansion and all the phenomena after it wouldn't change. However relativity says that at the very start, the size of the singularity that started expanding was zero – a mathematical point. Rainbow Gravity math says that it wasn't; was still incrediby small, but not zero. This in turn means the universe in this state of being very small, could have been existing forever before it started expanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I too was interested, and after some googling this is what I found.  I just ripped this explanation from [here]( <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-rainbow-gravity-theory-in-laymans-terms" target="_blank">http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-rainbow-gravity-theory-in-laymans-terms</a>) and take no credit for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for the A2A, I'll give it my best shot. One thing's for certain. I'm a Web developer and not a theoretical astrophysicist, so I canonly explain my understanding of rainbow gravity in layman's terms.</p>
<p>In scientific terms, the idea of rainbow gravity is not a theory, it is at best a postulate. But it's a testable postulate. Our current understanding is that gravity affects all electromagnetic radiation equally, bending it a given amount determined only by the gravitational force applied to the wave. Rainbow gravity says that's wrong. It predicts that powerful gravitational fields around supermassive objects will bend light (and other electromagnetic radiation) differently depending on its color (which is analogous to its electromagnetic wavelength) or more properly, its energy level. The rainbow term comes from the fact that if you look at a black hole up close and personal, and if the rainbow postulate proves true, you would observe not white light but a rainbow falling into the black hole.
It's a bit of a trip to visit the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy though. It's 25,000 light years, to be exact. So the fastest space vehicle we have ever built, Voyager 1 traveling at 39,000 MPH or 62,000 KPH would need 100 million years to get there, then 25,000 additional years for a signal traveling back to us at the speed of light to get back to us. Without massive gravity wells, we will need incredibly sensitive instruments to detect the differences in gravitational effect on different colors of the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>What's most interesting about the postulate is that if true, it will help resolve the incompatibilities between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Also, if rainbow gravity is correct, then the Universe did not begin with the Big Bang, it is far older. In fact, it may be infinitely old. So the neat thing is if rainbow gravity is right, it answers the conundrum about who or what could have caused the Big Bang. The bummer is it replaces it with the equally baffling mystery of how the Universe can be infinitely old. Oh well, there is no possible answer to first cause that makes sense to our human intuition.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit:  Forgot to actually explain it like we were five, will revise when I have time.  Sorry, I posted this while still waking up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So from what I gather, the REALLY simple explanation is just:</p>
<p>We thought gravity pulled things like light equally.  This new theory says it might not: it would pull certain ones more: (eg, red more than purple).</p>
<p>When we throw this new theory into some maths, turns out the big bang didn't start from a single point, but instead from a high density mash.</p>
<p>Doesn't so much &quot;destroy&quot; the big bang theory, just changes some details about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the Rainbow Gravity theory states that different energies (ie. wavelengths, or colours) of light are affected differently by gravity.  This helps reconcile some of the observed discrepancies between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  This destroys the Big Bang Theory because anything, no matter how dry, academic, or unfunny, is still more funny than that show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very briefly, it postulates that intense gravitational fields should bend light of different colors a different amount, a bit like a prism.  The bending amount would be based on the energy each photo carries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Particles with different energies will actually see different spacetimes, different gravitational fields,&quot; says Adel Awad of the Center for Theoretical Physics at Zewail City of Science and Technology</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would mean that the early structuring of the universe was radically different than we currently think it is.  Here is a <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rainbow-gravity-universe-beginning/" target="_blank">Scientific American article</a> describing it in more detail at a suitable EIL5 level.</p>
<p>For the record, it's not really accepted as a valid hypothesis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
