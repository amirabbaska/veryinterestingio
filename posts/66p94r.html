Did we run out of words so we have to start using some twice? Note, this is not homophones, which sound the same (raise, raze, rays), but homonyms, so the exact same word.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically I believe the description you are looking for is homographic homophonic antonyms, meaning words that are spelled the same, sound the same, but have opposite meanings. Others have taken stabs at explaining why this happens, but it is still weird as heck. </p>
<p>for instance, dust. </p>
<p>dust can mean the actual physical particles that accumulate upon things. </p>
<p>or it can mean the removal of particles from things. (as in to dust the counter top).</p>
<p>or it can mean to put particles of stuff onto things (as in to dust crops). </p>
<p>I'm sure people learning English find it annoying, but i think it is kind of cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways for a single word to have multiple meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One word branched off in the past and the connection between the different meanings is now secondary or obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>Two different words converged on the same sound by coincidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The word &quot;hard&quot; is an example of the first: It can mean strong/rigid, or difficult.  The concepts are related - it's <em>difficult</em> to break something that's strong and rigid - so it's an example of a single word with divergent meaning.</p>
<p>Another example of the first would be &quot;book.&quot;  Someone makes a reservation, the reservation was recorded in a book, ergo they &quot;booked&quot; the reservation.  Reservations today are not typically recorded in books, but they're still booked.</p>
<p>The second (convergence of multiple words) usually happens with simple words - especially ones that are a single syllable.  An example would be &quot;mole&quot;, which converged from different roots describing either a blemish on skin or a burrowing animal.  There's a bunch of other meanings too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I still feel like no one has answered his question. Specifically the &quot;bat and bat&quot; example.  There is &quot;bat&quot; the animal; there is &quot;bat&quot; to swing and knock something down; and there is &quot;bat&quot; as in a baseball bat. The last two make sense (to bat something is to swing at it and try to knock it down, a baseball bat is used to swing and hit a ball). But neither have anything to do with &quot;bat&quot; the animal. Everyone here is concentrating on words that may have opposite meanings but are still related to each other, like &quot;dust&quot; and &quot;hard&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Languages aren't invented by a committee of people drawing up a list of possible words and then deciding what meanings to assign to them. So no, we don't &quot;run out of words&quot;: languages evolve spontaneously according to rules we can discover, but not according to any conscious logic. As others have pointed out, homonyms just sort of happen, often by coincidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
