		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two chemists, Martin Kamen and Samuel Ruben, were looking into ways to essentially radio-tag carbon so they could track it performing various metabolic tasks in living animals.  This is a fairly common technique to this day - I've used radio-tagged steroids, for instance, injected into living things to see where they ended up, since radioactive things are relatively easy to detect in very small quantities.  Kamen and Ruben bombarded nitrogen with radiation and some of the atoms turned to radioactive forms of carbon.  C-11 turns out to be not so useful as it has a half-life (the period it takes half of the atoms to decay into other stuff) of about 20 minutes.  That's not long enough to study much of anything as it takes time to run experiments.  C-14 now, that's a solid 5500 years or so, which is also not great studying processes in living things as it decays too slowly (in lab-time).</p>
<p>Another chemist named Willard Libby realized that naturally produced C-14 in the atmosphere would only enter organisms while they were alive (all else equal, but that's another story).  That sounds promising because it would essentially put a 'clock' on any suitable living thing, as, after they die, they stop picking up new C-14 and just cook off steadily.  And a 5000 year half-life is pretty useful too, as lots of really interesting stuff happened with humans over the last 40-50,000 years (several half-lifes out).  Or so we thought, as before C-14, we didn't have a very good idea how old most things really were.  Sometimes we had written records and people had laboriously worked out things like tree-ring sequences, but every living thing has carbon in it so this could potentially work on virtually <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>Libby was right, and won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960.  C-14 remains the gold standard for dating although debate continues about how far back it works, and how dates can end up looking 'too young' or 'too old' because of various things like contamination. </p>
<p>EDIT: hey, thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, as you may know, the number of protons in an atom determines what kind of element it is. In it's stable form, carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, and is otherwise known as carbon 12. Nitrogen, the next element on the periodic table, is most stable with 7 protons and 7 neutrons, aka nitrogen 14. </p>
<p>Sunlight in our atmosphere causes atomic particles, like neutrons, to be blasted around (I can explain this more if you'd like). When normal Nitrogen 14 in the atmosphere comes into contact with a free flying neutron, it causes that nitrogen atom to gain the neutron, but also to immediately lose a proton. Since the atom now has 6 protons, it is officially carbon, but since it also has 8 neutrons, it is an unstable (and radioactive) form of carbon, Carbon 14. Carbon 14 behaves just like regular carbon, but since it is radioactive, it slowly decays into stable Carbon 13. This decay can be detected using a Geiger counter and its relative abundance can be quite easily measured.</p>
<p>Carbon 14 is generated in the atmosphere at a very constant rate, making it's concentration both in the air and inside every LIVING thing quite predictable (about 1 per trillion carbon atoms). However, when organisms die, they stop recycling carbon, so they no longer collect new Carbon 14. The Carbon 14 that they do have slowly decays, so the organism's concentration of the radioactive isotope is also slowly depleted.</p>
<p>Depending on when an organism lived (whether it's a tree 50,000 years ago or a squirrel 30 years ago) it will have some amount of Carbon 14 remaining. As such, the ratio of carbon 14 to stable carbon atoms can give us a very accurate measure of how long ago this organism stopped taking in new carbon (died). This is the basis of carbon dating.</p>
<p>TL;DR - carbon 14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, is generated at a constant rate in our atmosphere. Its concentration in the atmosphere is mirrored in all living organisms. When an organism dies, it's concentration of c14 slowly depletes. Depending on the ratio of remaining radioactive carbon to stable carbon, we can quite accurately estimate how long ago the organism lived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially scientists proved cabon-14 dating works comparing carbon-14 age with wood of a known age (calendar age) from old buildings, furniture, and then wood dated by counting tree rings (the science of dendrochronology). This ancient wood, up to 12,000 years old, was largely collected from Irish bogs. </p>
<p>When carbon-14 dating was first developed in the 1940s, it simply used a large sensitive Geiger Counter that detected carbon-14 radiation from an organic sample; shielded in pre-1945 steel made before the first atom bombs were detonated (btw, a lot of the steel came from Scapa Flow near the Shetland Island, north of Scotland were a fleet of German WWI naval vessels were scuppered. Since no one lost their lives, the ships are not a war grave and were salvaged). </p>
<p>It was soon found that carbon-14 had a half life of 5,730 years, thus the level of radioactivity of old organic samples were relate to its age. The less radioactive, the older it was. We knew we were on the right track by dating wood of a known age (calendar age); the wood from an old building, furniture and later, older bog wood whose age was determined by dendrochronology. </p>
<p>The first instruments were not very precise, giving ages +/- a hundred years or worse, but they soon improved and the carbon-14 ages got gradually more precise, to 100 to 50 years or a little better in comparison to known dates.</p>
<p>Soon, however, improvements stalled and discrepancies were noted in comparison to dendrochronology. It was discovered that inaccuracies were largely caused by variations in the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere over time, as well the carbon cycle / isotopic fractionation (plants have a preference for lighter non-radioactive carbon, giving a illusion of a slightly greater age).</p>
<p>The greatest step forward was the development of Atom Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), which counts single atoms of carbon-14 etc. It greatly increased precision and decreased the size of samples needed.</p>
<p>With increased precision, it became clear that Carbon-14 is not generated at a constant rate in the atmosphere, it's production varies according to solar activity and the Earth's geomagnetic field, this influences the abundance of cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere and the rate of carbon-14 production and abundance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The production of 14C in the atmosphere varies through time due to changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field intensity and in its concentration, which is regulated by the carbon cycle. As a result of these two variables, a radiocarbon age is not equivalent to a calendar age. Four decades of joint research by the dendrochronology and radiocarbon communities have produced a radiocarbon calibration data set of remarkable precision and accuracy extending from the present to approximately 12,000 calendar years before present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To overcome this problem it was necessary to use various proxies, not just dendrochronology, to accurately calibrate and adjust the raw carbon-14 dates.</p>
<p>Accordingly, tree rings and other proxies both proved the reliability of carbon-14 dating and increased its accuracy. By knowing the variations in initial carbon-14 content over time, we can produce far more accurate adjusted carbon-14 date. The tree rings give us an absolute tree ring calendar age going back 12,000 thousand years.</p>
<p>Several other proxies have been developed, they have been used to extend carbon-14 dating to 50,000 years ago e.g. isotopes of Uranium and Thorium in coral.</p>
<p>The rate of cabon-14 production in the past can also be determined by examining the abundance over time other isotopes such as beryllium-10 found in ice cores.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's never perfect because the environment changes over time, but one if the ways it is calibrated to be more accurate is with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology" target="_blank">Dendrochronology</a>, and it blew my mind when I first learned about it:</p>
<p>Basically, start by cutting down an old tree. Each ring represents a year, but every year has different weather and rainfall, trees survive fires, etc. So you end up with a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Next, find other long dead but adequately preserved trees. If you find the same distinctive sequence of rings, you can line them up and tell how old that preserved tree is. Then, you can line that tree's older parts up with even older samples and continue the process.</p>
<p>Using this method we have dendrochronology going back over 12,000 years which is then used to calibrate radiocarbon dating to a much higher precision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Because they knew the approximate year the king died, they were able to compare the results of the carbon dating to the age of the boat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
