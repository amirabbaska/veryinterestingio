		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can be detonated at any height, depending on what whoever planned the attack is trying to achieve. Some factors that would be considered:</p>
<p><strong>Fallout</strong></p>
<p>When a nuclear device detonates, anything within a vaporization radius of the device will be turned to vapor. The vapor of that matter will mix with the vapor of the device debris. That's how you get what's called fallout - various types of matter get mixed in with the highly radioactive device debris, get irradiated by neutron radiation, and can be transmuted into other radioactive elements. The more matter that's in that vaporization radius, the more and more dangerous fallout you get. So detonating high enough that the vaporization radius doesn't touch the ground will minimize fallout, and detonating on or right above the ground will maximize it though vaporizing all of those cubic meters of earth. In most cases, you would prefer to minimize fallout.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal Radiation</strong></p>
<p>This is non-ionizing radiation put out by the bomb, that travels in a straight line, doesn't go through things, and heats up whatever it hits. It can burn people to death, start fires, melt things, etc. If the device detonates too low, buildings and terrain may shield some of the surrounding area from thermal radiation, while a detonation high enough to be above these things will expose more things to it. You detonate low to get the maximum destruction to things very close to the detonation, and detonate higher to spread the destruction out more at the expense of a little less effect right under the bomb. Of course, even the lesser destruction from being under a higher-altitude detonation is more than enough to completely destroy most things.</p>
<p><strong>Blast wave</strong></p>
<p>This is a shock wave of outgoing high-pressure air. It tends to knock down buildings and other structures through high winds and pressure and inflict blast injuries to people. It spreads in a kind of similar way to the thermal radiation, but is more complex due to reflections, interference, air pressure at detonation altitude, and other factors. There's charts for what altitude to detonate at for various effects at various ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Vaporization</strong></p>
<p>Back to the vaporization mentioned in the fallout section. The other side of that is that, if you are attacking a hardened target, like something deep underground or not very affected by heat and blast, like train tracks, etc, it may be necessary to physically vaporize the target to ensure the intended destruction. So back to a ground or near-ground detonation.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>It all depends on exactly what you're trying to attack. Destroying a nuclear missile silo is different from destroying a military base or navy yard, which is different again from going for maximum casualties in a city, and any number of other types of targets one might want to attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main destructive power of a nuclear bomb is not the fireball/explosion, but the pressure wave that follows. Sure the main explosion is destructive, but the pressure wave allows it to destroy an entire city in one blast. By detonating it in the air, the pressure wave reaches much farther than if it was on the ground.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Nagasaki_1945_-_Before_and_after.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a before and after of the Nagasaki bombing.</a> As you can see, a normal ground detonation, no matter how powerful, would not be capable of utterly leveling a city like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read, when the blast wave hits the ground it gets reflected back up again, this &quot;fold&quot; in the blast wave increases its power several times. That is called &quot;Mach stem formation&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, the height of the detonation influences a number of things, among which the amount of nasties you throw in the athmosphere for the high altitude winds to carry around.<br />
Historically, Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were intended to be a demonstration of sheer power, hence they rigged the devices to explode above the city to maximise directly affected area and flatten the whole area. A ground level explosion would be somewhat shielded by the buildings and would have been even more unpleasant for the people around the impact area, but the outskirts of the city would probably have been fine: also, due to reflection of waves and such, the military has come up with the idea that an air burst actually directs more force sideways instead of wasting it in the ground (see the MOAB for a conventional example).<br />
All other nuclear explosions have been tests and aimed at minimizing unpredictable collateral damage, hence no fallout was wanted</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their are two examples why, the first was the Halifax explosion, and more importantly their was the LA explosion, both were over water, liquid and gas can act in a similar way, so when the Ship/s were in the harbour, they were virtualy suspended above solid ground, in the initial explosion the blast wave is omni directional, the down force makes first contact with the harbour floor, as it was passing through the water it was Unhindered until the harbour floor, the wave compresses and rebounds, thus causing a second blast wave, first down and out, second up and out.</p>
<p>I believe it was described as &quot;having two bombs for the price of one&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
