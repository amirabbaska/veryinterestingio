		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am 2nd year in an environmental studies course focusing on urban environments. Although this is just an example it can be applied to most if not all urban centres. Since a city will have large amounts of paved surfaces (skyscraper window reflection affects this too) this increases the temperature of the city and is called a heat island. Also the lack of respiration due to lack of trees increases the temperature. Typically these centres will be anywhere from 5-10 C hotter than forested or rural areas. Although this increases the actual temperature of a city, it does not create more GhG emissions.</p>
<p>edit: the increase in temperature may not be as drastic as 5-10C in all areas, I know in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area, this is the case for Toronto's heat island, the case varies among cities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="http://www.eapa.org/asphalt.php" target="_blank">http://www.eapa.org/asphalt.php</a></p>
<p>Assuming that the avrage road is 10meters wide, this means a total area of 50 000 km^2 of road. That is about 0.5% of europes surface area.</p>
<p>In the world there is about 18million km of road, assuming similar charestericstics as european roads, this equals to 0.12% of land area or 0.035% of earths surface area.</p>
<p>Does it contribute? Probably a bit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research and Practical Meteorologist here:</p>
<p>There are two effects that dark, paved surfaces have.</p>
<p>The first is discussed in several other comments the &quot;Urban Heat Island Effect&quot;.  That is a result of three primary factors -
1) Decreased Albedo
2) Increased Thermal Mass (capacity to hold heat)
3) Loss of other &quot;systems&quot; that control heat flow in nature (plant transpiration/respiration cycles, surface water evaporation and surface water movement)</p>
<p>These effects play out on the micro-&gt;mesoscale and, at least to my knowledge, exist largely in a &quot;we know they occur, they could easily have an effect, but we don't really know how to incorporate them&quot;.</p>
<p>The second, more subtle and &quot;insidious&quot; effect is the hyper local effects that urbanization has on temperature MEASUREMENTS.  These are all on the microscale.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be rules about where the thermometers go and how high off the ground they are, and for the most part they are followed, but not always.</p>
<p>My experiences in military aviation forecasting saw things as simple as cutting the grass around the ASOS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_airport_weather_station" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_airport_weather_station</a>) could result in a increase in measured temperature of ~3-5 degrees F... which can be enough on a hot day to cancel outdoor PT on a military base.</p>
<p>This is the effect that gets climate change deniers all bound up in false data... it's also one of the primary effects that data scientists attempt to correct for.
The classic case is the thermometer that used to be on the roof of a wooden post office at the edge of town, gets moved to the top of a metal warehouse surrounded by an asphalt parking lot that is not in &quot;downtown&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the grand scheme of global temperature, very little, almost nothing when compared to other more serious effects such as carbon building up in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>But however, heat islands are a phenomenon commonly observed in large cities with lots of asphalted roads, where the city itself is much hotter than the surrounding environment, so it definitely has a strong local effects. Large amounts of tall skyscrapers also help aggravate this even further by making it harder for wind to flow through the city.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. As a matter of fact, this phenomenon has been documented heavily and is known as a &quot;urban heat island&quot;.</p>
<p>Not only does a heat island affect the temperature but it changes the weather patterns over a heavily populated urban area (under the right conditions).</p>
<p>Additionally, when the urban area is on or close to a coast or coastal area, the heated rain run-off (from the hot streets) when dumped into the local body of water can cause explosive growth of certain toxic organism (&quot;red tide&quot; comes immediately to mind) which have been known to wipe out all the marine life in the body of water due to several factors, but usually due to oxygen deprivation to the animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
