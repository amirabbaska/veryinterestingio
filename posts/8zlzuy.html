		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping literally changes our very physiology. Our core body temperature drops which allows certain proteins to work differently than they do during our &quot;waking temp,&quot; as a broad example. It's not something we'd want easy control over. </p>
<p>Most importantly the process of getting sleepy is highly regulated by not only our Circadian rhythm but also by other hormone systems. </p>
<p>We need to burn energy to feel fatigued (when we use ATP and make Adenosine as a byproduct, which signals fatigue in humans). </p>
<p>We need a lack of blue-wavelength light to initiate the process of releasing melatonin at night, which makes us sleepy and helps initiate the sleeping-end of our Circadian processes. </p>
<p>We don't have voluntary control over sleep because it's chemically regulated. Adenosine, melatonin, hypercretin (Orexin), etc.. </p>
<p>It's not something we can flex like a muscle. It's essentially hormonal in nature and therefore requires us to use drugs (meaning ligands that bind to targets in our body) to control it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that there is an evolutionary benefit to sleep being a passive (rather than an active) drive. You need to sleep, and, if deprived, you <em>will</em> sleep (just like you <em>will</em> urinate, eventually). That said, finding the appropriate conditions for sleep can be difficult. There is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313009045" target="_blank">evidence of sleep patterns being conserved regardless of brain/body ratio</a>, which suggests that passive sleep entry is also conserved. There are cyclical hormonal changes (melatonin and cortisol being the main factors), which are involved in induction of sleep, so parts of the impetus to sleep are physiological, and induction is extrinsic. Under stressful circumstances, those extrinsic factors can also prevent sleep (like a mountain lion or worrying).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process of &quot;falling&quot; asleep is known as &quot;Stage 1 sleep&quot; or &quot;stage 1 NREM sleep&quot;. Brain activity changes and the eye moves slowly (NREM stands for Non-Rapid Eye Movement). No one knows <em>why</em> this stage exists, only that people who enter it always think they are awake (they are asked to get up, breaking the NREM brain activity pattern, and then questioned)</p>
<p>It is followed by &quot;Stage 2 sleep&quot;, which is a transition phase between Stage 1 and &quot;Slow Wave&quot; or &quot;Deep&quot; sleep</p>
<p>In short, you <em>do</em> &quot;just decide to be asleep&quot;, it's just that being asleep involves some 20 or so minutes of you not knowing you are asleep before you lose consciousness</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no 'why' to how humans exist. It's more about what evolutionary advantage it would be to being able to directly control your sleep system.</p>
<p>What would happen if you could manually control your heart rate? Any human that could do that would quickly accidentally kill themselves. And any human that could manually &amp; immediately control their sleep would do it wrong a lot and at inopportune times.</p>
<p>We can control our bladders - but it takes time and learning how to do it. Also what happens when we get terrified? Releasing our bladders spontaneously happens in inopportune times - but in that situation, it's not deadly. immediate sleep is deadly.</p>
<p>We can manually control our breathing (and now you are) to a certain extent. But that's because swimming would be beneficial to our ancestors in certain instances. And even with that, we can 'breathe wrong' in certain situations.</p>
<p>But for sleep, we DO have some control over it - similar to breathing. If you relax, get to a comfortable spot, in an area that isn't inducing anxiety or fear, close your eyes, and let your mind drift then you can &quot;allow&quot; yourself to sleep. This system gets you the ability to control your sleep, but indirectly and only when certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>That's much less dangerous and more advantageous than the direct control method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>According to this 1966 study, we have the First Night Sleep Brain. Some parts of the left hemisphere remain 50% more active during sleep the first night they sleep somewhere new. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
