		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some normal cycles.  For instance, body temperature tends to drop in the middle of the night and spike around when you're about to wake up (this is especially problematic to me, I have a spike where I often get stupidly hot 30 minutes before I need to get up).  For most of us, we sleep a bit better when we are cooler, which is why it's better to sleep in a colder room with blankets to keep you warm enough to be stable.</p>
<p>But the biggest issue is just stability when you aren't moving for 5-8 hours.  Say you're awake, and you're in a situation where heat builds up about 0.2 degrees per hour if you don't move due to blankets and other insulation.  No big deal, you move all the time.  If you're sleeping and you don't move the blankets keep trapping more and more heat.  Or you kick them off, and suddenly that sweat on your body cools you down and the temperature crashes.</p>
<p>Edit:  TLDR not moving for a long period of time is the biggest issue.  Go hunting in the winter (not moving for hours at a time and then maybe moving around) and you'll see even worse heat vs cold issues.  There is a huge difference in body heat between moving and expending energy vs. being still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your metabolism slows down before/when you're sleeping. It speeds up right before you wake up. </p>
<p>Therefore you fall asleep and stay asleep at the point where your body is producing the least amount of heat. So you bundle up with blankets.</p>
<p>In the morning when your metabolism gets moving again, you produce more heat, and suddenly all those blankets become WAY too much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the day is over the body needs waaay less energy in sleeping mode so the furnace that fuels the body turns off. To wake up again the body will need to start producing energy again and turns it back on. The furnace is your metabolism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
