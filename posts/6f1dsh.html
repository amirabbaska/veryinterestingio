	<title>ELI5: How and why does a word like 'bi-monthly' exist as it does? It simultaneously means twice a month and once every two months, which is an incredibly important distinction.</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bi- as a prefix usually means every two (as in bicentennial=200 years), but using it as &quot;twice per&quot; seems to have crept into usage as a malapropism. The more correct and less confusing way of saying &quot;twice a month&quot; is &quot;semimonthly&quot;. The error might arise because &quot;bi-&quot; can also be used to denote &quot;a pair of&quot; like bipedal=having two legs and bimonthly by analogy meaning &quot;a pair per month&quot;. That's just speculation though.</p>
<p>The same issue is also found in biennial incorrectly used as &quot;twice a year&quot; but semiannual is the right way to say this. Car dealers seem to get this right often in their semiannual sales. Good on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>originally the prefix &quot;bi-&quot; meant every other and &quot;semi-&quot; was used to mean half (so twice in the given period) in the same way that &quot;semicircle&quot; means a half circle. somehow many people started using &quot;bi-&quot; when they really meant &quot;semi-&quot;, probably because for something that happens twice in one month they were incorrectly associating &quot;bi-&quot; with the two occurrences instead of the time period that follows it. now both usages of &quot;bi-&quot; have become common enough that they are both accepted as being correct, which also has the effect of making the word fairly useless in most contexts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Language is an emergent order, so there are no people in charge to make sure things always make sense. So, if you were to use bimonthly, you'd want to make sure the context explained the meaning you intended. For example, if the word were used in a legal contract without clarification, I'd expect problems down the road. </p>
<p>semimonthly should be used if you mean twice a month, to avoid confusion</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I concur with those who've explained that semi-monthly is the correct term for twice a month, and that bi-monthly has crept into usage enough to be accepted. Unfortunate but true. </p>
<p>There are other examples of words that mean their own opposite. My favorite is &quot;sanction,&quot; which means both &quot;to approve&quot; and &quot;to disapprove&quot;/&quot;to punish.&quot;  So you usually have to use context clues. If a headline reads &quot;the UN sanctioned the use of force,&quot; you can figure out in the article what really happened. </p>
<p>That may not be possible with bi-monthly. If a boss says &quot;schedule this meeting bi-monthly,&quot; it's best to ask for clarification. </p>
<p>All of which goes to show that language is a spontaneous order, not a unified system governed by a rational body that decides what words should mean. Dictionaries define words according to how people DO use them, not how they think people should use them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be a lot of guess work going on in these comments. I, unfortunately, am going to add another guess, but hopefully my preface will help you view all the other comments with some healthy scepticism.</p>
<p>In English English the prefix 'Bi' almost always means '2 in 1'. You will find that the terms bimonthly, biannually, and biweekly are not ambiguous terms in British English.</p>
<p>In American English the prefix usually means '2 of'.</p>
<p>MY guess would be that the mixing of these two systems has caused the confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
