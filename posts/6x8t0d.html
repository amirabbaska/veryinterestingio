		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans need surprisingly little variety to just live. You can live 80+ years eating an extremely narrow diet if you don't die in an accident or from illness. Now, you won't feel good, you'll probably have a weaker immune system, etc. But if you get lucky enough to not get sick in spite of weak immunity and such, you can live a long time. Eating a healthy diet allows you to be bigger, stronger, less likely to get sick, etc, but it is hardly a requirement to live. And even then, what most people I have met think of as 'eating a healthy diet' is WAY in excess of what is necessary to be big, strong, and, well, healthy. You don't need to eat nothing but vegetables to get enough vitamins and such. For example: if you have some french fries at every lunch and dinner and you eat them with some ketchup, the ketchup alone has enough vitamin C that you will never get scurvy. You could do this for 80 years and never get scurvy. Eat a good sized orange every morning and you don't even need the ketchup to get <em>all the vitamin C you can possibly use</em>. Seriously. </p>
<p>The amounts of other vitamins that you need are pretty similar. In the developed world, if you just make an effort to eat a broad diet <em>at all</em>, you are unlikely to have any kind of noticeable deficiency. Vitamin deficiencies are most common in people with very narrow diets, such as extremely picky eaters, people with a lot of allergies, and vegans. Or in pregnant women because they need more of everything than other people.</p>
<p>Ancient humans ate whatever they could get, which could mean a 'healthy' diet if they are lucky, but it could also mean nothing but meat for a stretch of time, and then nothing but plants for a stretch of time, and then nothing at all for a short stretch of time, and they survived because 1) you don't need all that much of any specific thing, 2) everything you need can be gotten in a variety of ways and 3) your body holds onto some important stuff, so it takes a while for the negative effects of deficiencies to set in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few animals have extremely narrow diets, and animals tend to eat things that we don't. For example, carnivores will eat organs and entrails, while most of the time humans throw these out. Those organs often are packed with nutrients which are almost impossible to find in muscle tissue, which is most of what we think of as &quot;meat&quot;. Plant eaters usually eat a lot more by volume and often have lots of helpful microbes in their gut to help digest their food. </p>
<p>It is possible to stay alive on a very limited diet. It's healthier to eat more whole foods and get a broader range of nutrients. Also, eating &quot;just one food&quot; is a little misleading. If that one food is whole cooked potatoes, you can probably survive indefinitely. If that one food is white bread, you'll suffer from metabolic issues due to a lack of essential nutrients (white flour is made by removing the most nutritious parts of the grain, so it's missing a lot of good stuff)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you don't actually HAVE to eat a varied and healthy diet. As a species, humans will do just fine if we all eat a very unhealthy diet, reproduce six times between 15 and 20, have three babies die, and drop dead ourselves at 27. This is a valid survival strategy for many species.</p>
<p>The problem crops up when you actually want to live till you're 80 and have an active happy life. Then you'll have to take much better care of yourself.</p>
<p>Car analogy: You don't have to maintain your car, clean it or buy quality oil and gas if you plan on scrapping it when its three years old. But if you still want to drive it in 30 years, you have to take good care of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't much of an explanation but there was an issue in the US where we had alligators dying of a mysterious <del>bloating</del> neurological disease. </p>
<p>It turned out that the alligator's food chain was decimated and they only had a particular species of fish to feed on. edit: they were mainly eating gizzard shad</p>
<p>This mono-fish diet caused a vitamin deficiency (edit: thiamine aka vitamin b1) that was killing the alligators.</p>
<p>edit: nevermind here's a scientific journal article about the actual thing, not what some random redditor had to say: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20218498" target="_blank">Gizzard shad thiaminase activity and its effect on the thiamine status of captive American alligators Alligator mississippiensis.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are omnivores, which means we can eat a varied and balanced diet, but that doesn't mean we have to.</p>
<p>For one thing, the definition of &quot;healthy&quot; for a human includes a lot of stuff like being the appropriate height and weight for our age, not suffering from illnesses, a reasonably high level of comfort, and even sexual attractiveness.  But unless you're a biologist or a vet, you can't assess the first two; you can't assess the last one unless you're a member of the same species, and the remaining criterion is impossible to assess because an animal can't answer the question &quot;where does it hurt?&quot;  So when we say an animal is &quot;healthy,&quot; that basically means &quot;it ain't dead,&quot; and maybe &quot;it don't look like it's actively dying, either.&quot;  I'm not dead, and I don't look like I'm dying, but I eat like shit.</p>
<p>We also don't live the same lifestyle that animals live, or even that we lived during our own evolution.  Most people on Reddit probably have sedentary jobs and don't burn a lot of calories, despite being  member of the species that evolved to be persistence hunters.  Most people on Reddit can probably also go down to McDonald's and buy three double cheeseburgers easily, which is the amount it takes to be full and also probably more calories than a sedentary person needs in a day.  Animals just eat as much as they can of whatever they can get, and it's usually fine because they're as active as they evolved to be.  They don't have the ability to get in a car, go somewhere, hand over a few pieces of paper and just not be hungry anymore.  We can, so we're used to not being hungry.  To eat enough that you're not hungry, while also taking in an appropriate number of calories, requires eating a lot of low-calorie plant matter.  Since most people don't enjoy that, eating that in addition to the food that they do enjoy leads to a balanced diet.  Vegans don't eat a balanced diet, but they can eat a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Lastly, our idea of what a &quot;balanced diet&quot; is has been influenced by marketing.  The majority of humans can't even digest dairy, but the milk lobby don't fuck around, so in the US it's included in the government-endorsed concept of a &quot;balanced&quot; or healthy diet, and the 75% of the world's people for whom it doesn't really even qualify as food because their systems can't process it are deemed &quot;lactose intolerant.&quot;  They should just call folks like me &quot;lactose tolerant.&quot;*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: I love me some dairy.  I love cheese.  I love ice cream.  I'm a middle-aged man and I still drink milk sometimes!  But if 75% of the species gets sick from eating it, then it ain't really required for a healthy diet, is it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
