		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chess is slightly biased toward white, given even skill levels. All other factors are identical, it's just that white gets to move first and thereby set the tone for the match. </p>
<p>Due to this inequality, white players tend to play for a win (+1), and black players tend to play for a draw (+0.5). Black often plays defensively, while white tries to break that defense (at the very highest levels of play). Right now, that's the Ruy Lopez variation. This means that the first 11 or so moves are pre-planned and already locked in. If a game isn't won within 30 moves or so, it'll likely be a draw (at the highest levels), which means white has ~20 moves to win. </p>
<p>Black's job is easier; all he has to do is trade pieces until the board is relatively cleared, making white's job much harder. White has to reposition and restrategize and constantly look for very slim edges. </p>
<p>What this ends up meaning is that black is typically successful, because he has a much easier task. It's very difficult to beat a person who is around your own skill level, is playing defensively, and actively aiming to sabotage the game in order to achieve a draw. He isn't trying to win, he's just trying to not lose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is widely believed that with perfect play, a chess game will result in a draw.  The closer the players are to perfect, the more chance of a draw.</p>
<p>Another way to look at is bad players are more likely to make mistakes that instantly lead to a loss.  The better you are, the less of these kinds of mistakes you make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason tic tac toe does. The balanced but limited rule set means that as long as you know all the potential moves and don't make any mistakes, no one gains an advantage and so no one wins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for the how: While Chess is not necessarily a 'solved game'--meaning every possible permutation of moves is recorded for an &quot;optimal&quot; response to every action--the predictive and premeditative caliber of high-end players is very similar. Their practise in determining the available decision tree, x-amount of moves in advance, often leads players of equal skill to stalemate a match. This doesn't just apply to top-tier players, any players of near equal skill will see the same effect.</p>
<p>As for the why: It's strategically advantageous to tie, rather than lose, and it's technically easier (based on how chess works) to tie, rather than win. This makes a tie game in peak-performance of non-binary games statistically more common. Kotama brilliantly explains why ties are also strategic choices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try this from a different angle than several of the answers here.</p>
<p>Imagine a chess game where both players have traded pieces, and only have their kings left.  As the kings cannot move into check, neither side can possibly checkmate the other, and while one could potentially be stuck to one side of the board, neither can advance, so the game, and several others like it, is a draw.  Neither side can force a checkmate.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same game, except white has two of his knights left.  White could theoretically checkmate black with these resources, but it would require black to actively move into a position where white could complete the checkmate, and it is trivially easy for him to avoid such situations.  As checkmate cannot be forced, the game is a draw.  There are many variants of situations where the side with the disadvantage in pieces can, with good play, maintain a situation where they cannot be forced into a checkmate position.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few minor rules related to draws, namely the 50-move rule, threefold repetition, and stalemate.  In any of these cases, the game is a draw.  These situations (and the threat of causing them) can also be used by a player with inferior position to force a player in better position to lose his advantage.</p>
<p>A player who is losing (black by default, due to white's positional advantage granted by the first move) needs only to force the game into one of thousands of drawn endgame positions to avoid checkmate and thus avoid a loss.  At high level, a player with an advantage frequently is not able to prevent an opponent from doing so without giving up his advantages or risking losing himself.</p>
<p>Of course, you rarely see the actual endgames the top players are angling for, because they generally agree to a draw many moves before an &quot;obvious&quot; drawn endgame position is reached (or resign if a checkmate or massive disadvantage in material/position is inevitable).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
