		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another form of &quot;compression&quot; here that I haven't seen anyone mention.  You've got the literal physical &quot;compression&quot; of DNA around histones, you've got the compression that occasionally occurs where a single strand of DNA codes for multiple overlapping genes.  </p>
<p>But there's also a sort of &quot;compression&quot; that relates to how genes result in actual phenotype.  Genes do chemistry, more or less.  They make proteins, proteins produce other chemicals and join together to make the structures of cells.  Cells come together and make organisms.  But there's often not a 1:1 ratio of &quot;gene&quot; and &quot;physical attribute&quot;.  For example, there's not  &quot;left front leg&quot; genes, &quot;right front leg&quot; genes,  &quot;left back leg&quot; genes and  &quot;right back leg genes&quot;.  Instead there are a number of genes that get expressed in each limb to produce it.  Genes often do &quot;double duty&quot; in different body systems.  And final outcomes are usually complicated relative to the information content of the gene.  Consider a tree growing.  The final tree has a complex fractal branching shape, but this can arise from a relatively few genes that cause the tree to grow, then branch, then grow, then branch, with the same rules repeated <em>on</em> the branches, causing them to branch in turn.  Complexity emerges from interactions in the genes, and interactions between the genes and environment.</p>
<p>And this is the main sort of &quot;compression&quot; that I would say is involved in life.  It's the sort of compression that gives you the complexity of the human brain, with some 100 trillion neural connections storing at least a terabyte's worth of data, coming from a genome only 725 megabytes in size.  You can't describe every important factor of a human in our 725 megabytes of DNA data so we are, in a sense, uncompressed.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. By a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing" target="_blank">alternative splicing</a>, a single gene can be transcribed or &quot;read&quot; in a number of different ways, resulting in many protein variants from a single gene. So even though the human genome has roughly 20,000 protein-coding genes, we are able to produce many times this number of unique proteins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells DNA is normally wrapped around histone proteins. These proteins package the DNA and form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are then folded into high order structures eventually forming chromosomes. This process compacts DNA and adds another level of regulation.
An example From Wikipedia: each human diploid cell (containing 23 pairs of chromosomes) has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but wound on the histones it has about 90 micrometers (0.09 mm) of chromatin.
I guess you can argue whether this fits your original definition of compressed. Most of the time information in DNA is unavailable to copy unless the DNA has unwound and unfolded from the protein complexes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out there is a difference between physically packing DNA and coding it algorithmically to represent the same information with fewer bases. Your question seems to be aimed at the later. </p>
<p>Anyone who answers this definitively I think is reaching as it's still open as far as I know. However we do know something's.  </p>
<p>The information in a sequence of characters can be measured with Shannon entropy which gives a limit on how much something can be compressed. A really interesting paper just came out called DNA Fountain (using fountain codes to put binary data into a DNA representation for storage) they claim that coding DNA nears the maximum amount of information in a four character alphabet, implying that even with a sufficiently clever code we would not be able to appreciably compress DNA. </p>
<p>That being said there are vast regions of DNA that are highly repetitive and have little information content. In theory this could be compressed (although practically doing so is still a challenge) but this looks at these regions only from a data perspective. Their physical structure could be functional. eg it might be physical spacing or something, in which case compression could ruin it. Again the function(s) if any of DNA desserts are poorly understood. But this is looking at interactions outside of those normally considered when talking about compression codes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biology and biochemistry undergrad here! (with a couple of grad-level genetics courses under my belt, if that makes a difference)</p>
<p>Sort of! Some viral genomes (including some DNA viruses) have overlapping open reading frames, meaning that you can actually get 3 gene products from one gene! </p>
<p>How this works is let's say you have a gene that looks like ABCDEFGHI. Further behind that A is a start codon, something that tells RNA polymerase (what makes the thing that ribosomes make proteins out of) to start reading here. Later on, when the protein is created, we have 3 letters per amino acid. One way of reading it is ABC DEF GHI. With more of those start codons, you can get more, different ways of reading that 9 letter series! You can have ..A BCD EFG HI., .AB CDE FGH I.., or some in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>In essence, this one strand of DNA can give you up to 6 protein products! </p>
<p>Another method that some other posters mentioned is differential splicing. Let's say you have that same 9 letter strand, ABCDEFGHI. You can make a 3 word protein from the mRNA ABC DEF GHI, or you can take some of the internal letters out to make different words! For example, we can take out CDEF, which would give us a few words ABG HI.! This gives us a different protein product than earlier. </p>
<p>In short, there are a few methods for &quot;compressing&quot; the information contained in a DNA genome. All of these come with their own drawbacks, but in general they reduce the amount of DNA letters needed to create many different proteins!</p>
<p>If you're confused about any of these parts, feel free to ask further questions. I'm writing this to procrastinate revising for my virology exam, but feel free! If you're interested in more information about either of these topics, also feel free to reply to this post!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
