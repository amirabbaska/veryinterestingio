		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes can only have masses much greater than the Planck mass. A black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation until its mass starts to near the Planck mass. Around that, full quantum gravity takes over and you cannot simply speak of a standard black hole anymore. There are a couple things that can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>the black hole becomes some stable (i.e. not evaporating anymore) object with mass ~ Planck, called a &quot;remnant&quot;</li>
<li>the black hole completely disappear leaving only particles (which have all mass &lt;&lt; Planck)</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is considered much more likely in general. The details however depend on your preferred theory of quantum gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens as black holes evaporate is an unresolved question.</p>
<p>The best guess today is that black holes will radiate mass away until they get very small and the hawking radiation is really bright, and we don't have any idea about what happens then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question about the Schwarzschild radius, no. It sounds like you are picturing that there is something that gets dense and then it is so dense that it's surface is below the radius and that's how it looks like a black hole. This is fundamentally not the proper picture. The black hole does not just contain its mass below the S. radius, it contains all of the mass at a single point at the absolute center, referred to as the singularity. The Schwarzschild radius is not actually a physical thing, it's a point in space at which the escape velocity from the object reaches the speed of light. As the black hole loses mass, this radius simply moves in. </p>
<p>Some other people have talked about the theory for what happens when it gets extremely small, but until you hit Quantum levels, it never loses the property of trapping anything that passes the horizon. </p>
<p>Also, fun fact. No one has ever detected Hawking radiation, and there isn't really a way to actually detect it as far as we know. I've heard suggestions that a nearby primordial black hole could be used to do it, but it remains nearly impossible to verify generally, making this theory pretty unhelpful as far as science goes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
