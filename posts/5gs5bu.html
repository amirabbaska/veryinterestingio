It's great though and appreciate all of you sharing your thoughts on my question. Definitely learnt some new knowledge. One thing I have to say though, I find it sad that some Africa Americans here had to sway to these stereotypes and stop eating watermelon. I think life is too short not to enjoy what is a pretty great fruit and certainly not allow a stereotype to control your life. I'm a minority as well where I grew up and plenty of stereotypes about us too so I know the feeling, but when it comes to food, one of the biggest pleasures in life, I'm not giving any of it up! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watermelons have a historical reputation of being a messy fruit, and a fruit for lazy people, because they are easy to grow, and it's hard to eat a watermelon while doing work. Many black slaves were allowed to grow watermelons on the side, and when many slaves became free, they continued to grow and sell watermelons, so it became a sort of symbol of freedom. The racist white South twisted the symbol for their own means, saying that watermelons are messy, unclean fruits for lazy people. At least, that is the origin of the stereotype that has been perpetuated for 150 or so years. Once a stereotype that old gets started, it becomes deeply ingrained, and people forget what the stereotype actually means, but they will still repeat the stereotype anyways, usually for a cheap laugh or a cheaper insult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Read this article for the real history behind watermelons. It has nothing to do with blacks liking watermelons more than anyone else, or that the fruit is for lazy people. I think /u/suezetta must like making things up:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mark Twain on watermelon:
From Puddinhead Wilson</p>
<p>&quot;The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart, and not to be mentioned with commoner things. It is chief of this world's luxuries, king by grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took: we know it because she repented.&quot;</p>
<p>From the Autobiography:</p>
<p>&quot;I know how a prize watermelon looks when it is sunning its fat rotundity among pumpkin vines and “simblins”; I know how to tell when it is ripe without “plugging” it; I know how inviting it looks when it is cooling itself in a tub of water under the bed, waiting; I know how it looks when it lies on the table in the sheltered great floor space between house and kitchen, and the children gathered for the sacrifice and their mouths watering; I know the crackling sound it makes when the carving knife enters its end, and I can see the split fly along in front if the blade as the knife cleaves its way to the other end; I can see its halves fall apart and display the rich red meat and the black seeds, and the heart standing up, a luxury fit for the elect; I know how a boy looks behind a yard-long slice of that melon, and I know how he feels; for I have been there. I know the taste of the watermelon which has been honestly come by, and I know the taste of the watermelon which has been acquired by art. Both taste good, but the experienced know which tastes best.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know how watermelon became associated with African Americans when it was a treat enjoyed by all. But it became a trope or meme in the form of a picture of a black child enjoying an enormous slice of watermelon starting in the mid 19th century. It was considered cute or funny, and the same idea was repeated by many cartoonists and advertising artists for nearly 100 years. I don't think it was specifically racist but it got that reputation over the years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many things that get attributed to black people are actually aspects of southern culture. There is a lot of black diaspora that moved into the north and their southern peculiarities became black peculiarities that they got ridiculed for. Minstrel shows were a product of the North, not the south. The north wasn't more or less racist, just anti-slavery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
