		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An average square meter of the Earth receives on average <a href="http://sites.gsu.edu/geog1112/files/2012/10/Energy_Balance.png" target="_blank">341</a> watts of solar power.  Of this, about 161 watts is absorbed at the surface.</p>
<p>In comparison, the average geothermal heat flux is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget" target="_blank">.09</a> watts per square meter, 4000 times smaller and basically negligible for the purposes of evaluating Earth's surface climate.</p>
<p>However, the incoming solar energy is returned to space as infrared energy emitted from the ground.  The balance between these two shifts over the seasons, but over the whole year they cancel out almost exactly.</p>
<p>The net result is that the seasonal cycle cause the ground to heat and cool in the <a href="https://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/Cooling/EarthTemperatures.htm" target="_blank">upper few meters</a> of the ground, but below that its impact is almost zero.</p>
<p>When you think about it, if heat from the sun were constantly flowing into the ground everywhere, the Earth would be constantly getting hotter, and it isn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in the arctic years ago. We had some thermometers down some drill holes to monitor temperatures at 25cm intervals. The air was about 25C, the first data point 25cm underground was about 5C, by about 1.5-2m you would be in permafrost at -7C and it stayed constant for about 50-75m before it started to creep up again by less than 1C per 100m. Until you get down to 1km deep or more the temperature from within is very negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this question IRL before and never got the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>I also don't seem to have seen the answer on this thread.</p>
<p>Let me explain, and hopefully someone smarter than me can reply with an answer:</p>
<p>Dig under the surface and the temperature doesn't fluctuate much.</p>
<p>That temperature cannot be used as the heat the core of the earth contributes because both the core and the sun are contributing to the entire temperature of the earth to some degree, in an equilibrium.</p>
<p>The point of no temperature fluctuation year round is just the point where heat becomes thoroughly insulated long enough that not enough dissipates from lack of sunlight to notice any change over the course of a year.</p>
<p>But the overall temperature of the earth is a combination of that emitted from the core, and that received by the sun.</p>
<p>So minus all light from the sun, and removing all currently &quot;stored heat&quot; that originated from the sun, what would the temperature of the surface be due solely to that emitted from the core?</p>
<p>Basically, picture a thermally insulated bottle with warm water inside, and a hot lamp on the outside of the bottle.</p>
<p>Minus the hot lamp, what would be the temperature on the outside of the bottle contributed from the warm water inside?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the surface, it’s negligible. Something like less than 10 Terawatts of energy. The crust’s thickness insulates virtually all thermal radiation from the earth’s core. </p>
<p>Digging down is a great question, I came across this <a href="https://youtu.be/E39GIysMevQ" target="_blank">video</a>  a few months ago and I think it will answer your question about thermal energy at various depths.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
