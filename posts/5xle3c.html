		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A compass is problematic, because they are designed to work with gravity.  At the center of the magnetic needle is a cup, and that cup rests on a support needle.  You have to hold the compass level, so that the needle can swing freely.  If you are off-level, the needle will jam or drag on the housing. Essentially, compasses only works in a single plane.  However, in the microgravity environment of Earth orbit, there is nothing to keep the magnetic needle from drifting off of the support needle and jamming against the housing.  There is no way to hold it so that the needle is constrained to pivot on the support needle.  So, you will not get accurate results.</p>
<p>However, if you just let a bar magnet float free, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uKt2i2jvc" target="_blank">like they did on the International Space Station</a>, it will align itself with the strongest magnetic field.  In general, this will be the Earth's field unless a stronger magnet is closer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about traditional compasses, and they're right as long as we limit ourselves to those types, but there's 2 types which are far more useful, especially if you want to bring them into space.</p>
<p>1- Ship compasses, which are designed to rotate freely in all directions, allowing the compass to maintain a fairly accurate (minus shaking) bearing even in rough seas (this solves the issue of trying to keep the compass level enough to have it spin properly when you're ascending/descending waves). This sort of compass would point along the strongest magnetic field in it's local area (so in the ISS it would point north, unless you brought a stronger magnet nearer)</p>
<ol>
<li>Electric compasses, which function in many different ways, but generally do the same thing as type 1, just without using a free swiveling magnet. Ergo they would direct you to the strongest local magnetic attraction. One benefit of these is that they can function under much lower strengths. Therefore they could point along the suns magnetic field, or even the galactic field if you took them out of the solar system</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would point in the direction of the closest strong magnetic field.  If you were relatively close to Earth, it would still point to the North Pole.    If you approached another planet with a magnetic field (Mars, for example, does not have one) it would point in the direction of it's north pole.  If you weren't close enough to a planet, it would point to the Sun's north pole.  Get far enough away from our solar system and it would either point at the center of our galaxy, or spin aimlessly if the magnetic field generated by our galaxy isn't strong enough to attract it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
