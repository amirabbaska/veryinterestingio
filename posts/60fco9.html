		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, not literally, since squeezing a metal wire typically won't do anything (at best you'll compress the plastic insulation that surrounds it).</p>
<p>But it is true that the current that can run through a wire, at a given voltage, depends on the thickness of the wire. Thin wires have a higher resistance and can therefore carry less current at a given voltage (or, stated differently: require a higher voltage to carry a given amount of current).</p>
<p>This is why certain high current applications have requirements on wire thickness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an analogy, and not &quot;the same as&quot; - IMO this analogy is effective but many despise it.  It is good for a basic understanding but not really suitable for miscellaneous &quot;comparisons&quot; like squeezing the pipe, but as is pointed out, a thinner wire would have a higher resistance to current flow.

The Wiki is not a bad reference.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For each wire is an Electrical Conductance ( A/sqm) as the reciprocal value of the electrical resistance defined. If you make the the wire thinner it may overheat and melt at a certain point.
It is a real threat especially for old buildings because some decades ago, relatively thin wires were used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a system with fluid in a pipe, if you have a pressure difference in the pipe, the fluid will try to equalize the pressure, and will move from high pressure to low pressure to do so. The higher the pressure, the higher the flow rate, proportional to the resistance in the pipe. </p>
<p>In a system with electrons in a wire, if you have a voltage difference in the wire, the electrons will try to equalize the voltage, and will move from low voltage to high voltage to do so. The higher the voltage, the higher the current, proportional to the resistance in the wire.</p>
<p>In both cases, resistance is proportional to the cross sectional area of the pipe or wire. If you reduce that, you reduce the rate of current or water flow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flow of current through a wire is not exactly the same as the flow of water through a pipe. It is kinda similar, and is used to teach basic electric principles to novices</p>
<p>In this case, decreasing the cross-sectional area of a wire will increase resistance and voltage drop. The squeezed area will also get hot, potentially causing failure if it gets hot enough</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
