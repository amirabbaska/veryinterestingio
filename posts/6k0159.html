		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make a homemade cookie, you need a handful of common ingredients.  Butter, sugar, flour.  You don't need preservatives because the cookies will be made and eaten within days.  You don't need color agents because you don't care about consistency, or the way they look (to a degree, of course.  No one wants a gray cookie)  You're not worried about shelf life, or maintaining the texture and flavor inside of a plastic package filled with nitrogen gas.  Once the cookies are made, you're not going to need to worried about temperature abuse (going from hot to cold to hot).  So, all of these things, plus others such as flavor and sourcing, bring a unique-ish pre-packaged soft baked cookie to your grocery shelf.  </p>
<p>Food Scientists-more specifically grain and bakery scientists- have to use ingredients that you normally wouldn't find or use in your own home in order to deliver a consistent product that lasts for a decent amount of time.  These ingredients preserve flavor, texture, color, etc. but, they also impart their own flavor, even if it is barely noticeable.  And a lot of the time they don't have a taste but they kind of do have a taste, almost bitter if you taste enough at once, but if you take and combine a few of these in very small amounts, you CAN get an off-flavor that is kind of bitter.  The scientists hope you don't notice by adding a shit ton of sugar, but we can tell....  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the chief chemicals responsible for keeping baked goods &quot;soft&quot; as if they were fresh baked is L-Cysteine. This is a common Sulfur containing amino acid, and is responsible for all varieties of curly hair. Sulfur is going to have an effect on your gases. And L-Cysteine by itself doesn't have a pleasant flavor.
Gross news though! Apparently the &quot;natural&quot; ingredient is sourced from [duck feathers, human hair, and hog hair] (<a href="http://www.vrg.org/blog/2011/03/09/l-cysteine-in-bread-products-still-mostly-sourced-from-human-hair-duck-feathers-hog-hair/" target="_blank">http://www.vrg.org/blog/2011/03/09/l-cysteine-in-bread-products-still-mostly-sourced-from-human-hair-duck-feathers-hog-hair/</a>)
Enjoy your soft baked hog hair cookies!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps someone can follow-up on my comment with the specific additive(s), but the big difference between fresh baked cookies and pre-packaged cookies is that one has to sit on a shelf for months and still taste the same as the moment they left the factory. Preservatives are added to the mixture to allow for a longer shelf life. That's likely what you're tasting.</p>
<p>You may have even randomly stumbled upon several brands that use the same facilities to produce their foods. This would mean similar production methods, which could mean similar additives or even similar recipes that the common baker uses in their facility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of these packaged cookies are actually <em>the very same recipe</em>, no matter whose name is on the package -- they're baked at the same facility, in huge batches, for the company whose name is on the package.  That's why they all have the same taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
