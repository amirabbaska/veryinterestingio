		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched an oxen pull competition last weekend and a conversation surrounding efficiency came up. The oxen (less than 2900lbs) were dragging a 1000lbs (steel) sled with 6000lbs of weight added to it across dirt. The rope connecting the two was somewhere between a 30-45 degrees incline. What is the most efficient way to drag this sled? A rope with no incline or is the upward force to reduce frictional force more efficient?</p>
<p>edit:
thanks to everyone who contributed, sorry for posting and ghosting last night. A lot of these side comments were brought up in discussion after the ox pull competition. We were able to get part of the answer on our own but after a few beers the math and our concentration a limiting our ability to get there. This was my first time posting to reddit, found out i dont really know how to use it.</p></div></div>

<p>θ is the optimal angle when μ is the frictional coefficient.
For a frictional coefficient of 0.1 there is 1 pound of of force holding a sled from sliding for every 10 pounds pushing down on it.
At the optimal angle θ, the distance in front of the sled times the frictional coefficient equals the height above the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;optimal&quot; in this context, you could mean a few things. I think the most reasonable interpretation is &quot;the angle which maximizes the acceleration of the object&quot;. This can be solved with some introductory physics and a little bit of calculus.</p>
<p>Suppose we apply a force of fixed magnitude <em>F</em> to some load with mass <em>m</em>. The coefficient of friction between the load and the ground is μ. What angle of application θ maximizes the acceleration <em>a</em> of the load? If <em>N</em> is the magnitude of the contact normal force between the load and the ground, then Newton's second law gives us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(F cos(θ) - μN)<strong>e**<em><em>x</em></em> + (F sin(θ) + N - mg)</strong>e<strong><em><em>y</em></em> = ma</strong>e**<em><em>x</em></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence the net acceleration of the load is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a = (F/m)(cos(θ) + μ sin(θ)) - μg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what angle θ (in the interval [0, π/2]) maximizes <em>a</em>? Simply solve the equation da/dθ = 0, which gives</p>
<blockquote>
<p>θ<em><em>optimal</em></em> = tan^(-1)(μ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that for a very high friction coefficient, the load angle should be almost vertical. For a very small coefficient, the load angle should be almost horizontal.</p>
<p>Now does this actually give the maximum? Yes. You may verify that the second derivative d^(2)a/dθ^(2) is strictly negative for all θ in [0, π/2]. Another way to see that this is the optimal angle is to rewrite the acceleration as follows:</p>
<p><code>[; a = \frac{F}{m}\sqrt{1+\mu^2}\cdot\cos\left(\theta-\tan^{-1}(\mu)\right)-\mu g ;]</code></p>
<p>So we can see immediately that the maximum value of <em>a</em> on the interval [0, π/2] occurs when the argument of the cosine is 0, or when θ = tan^(-1)(μ). We can also see that the maximum acceleration in that case is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a<em><em>max</em></em> = (F/m)(1+μ^(2))^(1/2) - μg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There <em>is</em> a solvability condition here, since this maximum acceleration should be non-negative. This requires that <em>F</em> have a certain minimum value. That is, for this problem to make sense at all we require that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>F ≥ (μ/(1+μ^(2))^(1/2)) mg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(For small μ, this means <em>F</em> can be very small. For large μ, the above expression is only slightly less than <em>mg</em>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>One last thing to note though is that to achieve this optimal angle in practice, the yoke on the oxen would have to be constructed in such a way so that the angle of application is constant. But say we were simply pulling a large box along the floor with some rope, so that the angle is not fixed unless we specifically adjust our force <em>F</em> to fix the angle at some desired value.</p>
<p>We found a relationship between <em>F</em>, <em>a</em>, and θ (given the constants <em>m</em> and μ). Maintaining a constant <em>F</em> is really not as easy as you may think with a rope, for which the angle θ is allowed to vary. Many times we often pull or push loads in such a way that the load has zero net acceleration. That is, we <em>don't</em> apply force to maximum acceleration, but instead we apply a force to keep the speed of the load steady. In that case, we can ask the slightly different question: given an application force <em>F</em>, what angle will the rope end up at if we pull the load with constant velocity?</p>
<p>In that case, we simply set <em>a</em> = 0 and solve for θ. We get</p>
<p><code>[; \theta_0 = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{mg}{F}\cdot\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}\right)+\tan^{-1}(\mu) ;]</code></p>
<p>If you want to get <em>really</em> fancy, you can use the identities</p>
<p><code>[; \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right)+\tan^{-1}(x)=\frac{\pi}{2} ;]</code></p>
<p><code>[; \cos^{-1}(x)+\sin^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} ;]</code></p>
<p>to rewrite the angle for zero acceleration as</p>
<p><code>[; \theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2} + \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}\right)-\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{mg}{F}\cdot\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}\right) ;]</code></p>
<p>(This is nice only because now it looks very symmetric, but it's totally unnecessary.)</p>
<p>Observe that the solvability condition on <em>F</em> implies that the above expression is well-defined. Also observe that tan^(-1)(μ) is the optimal angle for maximizing acceleration. So we see that the natural angle the rope slacks to if we pull at constant velocity is actually <em>larger</em> than the optimal angle. (Remember that cos^(-1)(x) is a non-negative angle.) Does this make sense to you? Should the rope really have a <em>larger</em> angle?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
