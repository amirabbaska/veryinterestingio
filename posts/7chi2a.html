	<title>ELI5: Why do Home dishwashers need to take 3 hours? I know it’s for energy star requirements, but commercial machines get the job done in 90 seconds. Why the massive difference? Wouldn’t even a more powerful motor take less electricity for such a big time difference?</title>

The poor sucker getting paid barely enough money to survive is the dishwasher. All the machine is for is removing whatever small bits are left over after the dishwasher has already mostly cleaned them off. Long story short: If you want clean dishes quickly, you're gonna have to get your hands dirty.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>also, it's important to note commercial restaurant washers don't have to deal with stuck-on, dried food. The plate comes back from the table, gets pre-scrapped, then rinsed with a high-pressure manual spray, with hot water. The plate is essentially clean now, save for a few random bits. Food never had a chance to dry, thus it is very easy to wash quickly. Silverware soaks in hot water up until the dishwasher has enough to do a full load, so they don't dry out either. The same plate might serve ten people in one weekend dinner service, it comes down to just how FAST plates move through a busy restaurant.</p>
<p>Homes don't work like this. People let food dry out on the counter, or in the machine itself waiting on a full load. A longer cycle is necessary to re-hydrate the stuck-on food before it can be carried away.</p>
<p>Take an average load of dried dishes from home, I guarantee most of them would not come out clean in a commercial dishwasher, and would require many, many cycles. The restaurant machine exists only to finish plates that are basically 99% clean already. The detergent just takes away remaining oil/butter, and the rinse cycle gets the plates to a high enough temperature to sanitize, with the help of a little bleach. Rinse aide makes them dry quickly. Within ten minutes it's heading back to a table. An average &quot;round trip&quot; is under an hour. Any plates or equipment with real stuck-on bits must be manually scrubbed.</p>
<p>It's comparing apples to oranges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, finally... My time to shine!  I didn't read through all the comments so others may have mentioned all of this already.</p>
<p>I work for a major appliance manufacturer and this comes up quite often.  One main reason is the fact that they are using so much less water - we're talking just a few gallons.  That water is run through the wash arms at different times, so not all of the dishes are being sprayed and cleaned at once.</p>
<p>Another reason is due to the sensors inside that tell the dishwasher how dirty the water is.  So many people think they are supposed to essentially wash the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher - STOP THIS!  It needs to sense the food/drink particles in order to clean properly.</p>
<p>And as mentioned in other comments, heated dry.  While it adds to the time, heated dry, along with rinse aid, is essential to getting your dishes (and the inside tub) dry.  If you don't do these things and your dishes aren't dry, don't call the manufacturer.  Read the manual that gives with it.  Any other fancy options you may add on, say sanitize, are going to add to the time as well.</p>
<p>Mind you all of this applies to the brands I work with, but I'm sure there is some crossover to others as well.</p>
<p>Edit: my first ever gold!  Thanks, my fellow Redditor!  I'm so glad this random knowledge has finally paid off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You hit it on the head. Residential dishwashers are bound by EPA regulations. Lower water/electric consumption. Commercial dishwashers do not follow these. </p>
<p>Sinners circle explains how proper balance of chemicals, mechanical power, time and temperature need to be balanced for cleaning. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.proz.com/kudoz/English/marketing_market_research/2507584-sinner_circle.html" target="_blank">https://www.proz.com/kudoz/English/marketing_market_research/2507584-sinner_circle.html</a></p>
<p>If you reduce temperature/mechanical power (to save energy) you must increase time to balance sinners circle.  This is where commercial dishwashers can clean in 15 minutes or less. Extremely high water temperature and pressure = low time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
