		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert, but I have some knowledge of this. Everyone correct me, please. I know I'm not getting meiosis quite right, it's been a long time since I've done cell bio/genetics. Anyway, never too late to learn, OP. </p>
<p>Sperm cells, as the name suggests, are a type of cell in the human body. They are created through a cell division process called meiosis, which occurs in the testicles. A similar process creates eggs in women, and occurs in the ovaries. </p>
<p>Sperm are haploid cells, which means they contain half the chromosomes (your genes/DNA, basically the instructions for making you) of a normal cell. A normal cell has 46 chromosomes but a sperm cell only has 23, 22 standard chromosomes with small differences in their code that make you unique and a sex chromosome that will be either X or Y to determine your <del>gender</del> sex. A female egg cell has the other 23 chromosomes, 22 regular and an X chromosome. If a sperm with a Y chromosome meets an egg, you get XY and the resulting child is a boy. If the sperm has an X chromosome, the child is a girl. The sex chromosomes are called X and Y because they're actually shaped liked Xs and Ys. Women's eggs only have X chromosomes. </p>
<p>Meiosis is similar to a cell division process for most other cells, mitosis, (where a cell clones itself, divides, then splits into two new cells) except there is are additional steps. One of these steps is recombination/crossover, where after cloning themselves, the chromosomes pair up (imagine the same chromosome from a parent holding onto a twin and lining up across from the same chromosome from the other parent and its twin). Then the chromosomes crossover, where they link up and swap parts with their partners from the other parent. Then the cell divides, creating two new cells with chromosomes that are a mishmash of chromosomes from both parents. These then divide again, so that there's only 23 chromosomes in each cell. </p>
<p>This is a highly simplified summary. In terms of your last question, sperm are basically the same between human and non-human animals. The primary difference is the number of chromosomes. However, they undergo similar processes (meiosis and all) and share the majority of their characteristics.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually in developmental biology right now, so this is one of the subjects.</p>
<p>Sperm cells are created in the testes from stem cells, which are types of cells that can develop into more specialized cells. These stem cells are guided through development by signals from the nurse cells that encompass them, while some stem cells remain undeveloped to maintain a population of cells that can create more sperm. As the cells develop they go through meiosis, which means their chromosomes recombine and each of the four cells has one of each chromosome instead of two chromosomes each with two chromatids.</p>
<p>After meiosis the sperm develops its characteristic features by going through what is called spermiogenesis: flagellum, compacted nucleus, an acrosome to help reach the ovum, etc. However, the sperm doesn't become fully developed until after it leaves the body and undergoes what is called capacitation, which allows it to sense molecules emanating from the area surrounding the ovum and move towards them, as well as increase its speed and allow it to fuse with the ovum. Capacitation can happen in the female or outside (in sea water for sea urchins) depending on the species.</p>
<p>Components of the sperm include a whip-like flagella for movement, an acrosome, which releases proteins that digest the material around the ovum, bind to the ovum, or help signal to the ovum that it has been fertilized, centrioles for the flagellum, and glycoproteins (proteins with sugar on them) for ovum binding and fusion etc.</p>
<p>As far as difference between species, I'm not especially familiar, but they should have different surface molecules to recognize ova of a specific species, and I image their shape is generally similar between species, but I'm not certain.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just animals that have them -- many plants &amp; algae produce sperm cells too (they evolved in parallel to sperm of animals). </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/s_7sOEH69-0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/s_7sOEH69-0</a>  </p>
<p>^^ Fern sperm cells moving (in slow mo)</p>
<p>Plant sperm are an interesting contrast to those of animals like humans -- plant sperm usually move using structures called flagella. Sometimes they have many thousands of flagella on one sperm cell. </p>
<p>Like animals they develop from mother cells by halfing the chromosome count (meiosis). But plants don't have testes, so they are produced inside different structures, such as inside pollen grains, or in antheridia of ferns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
