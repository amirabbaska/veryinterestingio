	<title>Today i dripped some super glue on the colored print of my t-shirt by accident. To my surprise my t-shirt got really hot where the glue had landed and started to fizzle and smoke quite a lot. Does anyone have an idea of why this happens?</title>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate#Reaction_with_cotton" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate#Reaction_with_cotton</a></p>
<p>Basically the cyanocrylate is suspeneded in an acid in the bottle...then coming into contact with air, water or an analog like the hydroxy-rich cellulose (type of sugar) of the cotton fiber. This cause the glue's curing (polymerization) to happen very energetically, and waste heat is the result here. </p>
<p>If your cotton shirt didn't fully ignite in flame (smoulder only), your super glue's exothermic reaction during curing  isn't quite energetic enough.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now that you have been answered I will give you a fun experiment. </p>
<p>In a clean safe area with good ventilation grab some CA (super glue) and some baking soda. Get a scrap piece of cardboard like from a cereal box and a toothpick. This will all need to be discarded when done.</p>
<p>Pour out a small amount of baking soda and then squeeze out some super glue onto the baking soda, roughly equal amounts, now mix it with a toothpick. </p>
<p>It will turn into a milky white substance and then in about 15 seconds it will begin to get very hot, smoke a small amount and then you will see it harden and turn an opaque white.</p>
<p>This happens all within 2 to 3 seconds of it beginning. </p>
<p>I use this often to create a paste to fill in gaps in small plastic parts and create something from nothing. </p>
<p>For instance my wifes glasses recently broke and were under such high stress that the place where they broke could not go back together. So I got them as close as I could, glued the lense to the plastic frame and then filled in the spot that was unable to close and then used files to clean it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Superglue uses cyanoacrylate as the binding agent. Cyanoacrylate polymerizes when exposed to the hydroxide ions in water, causing it to harden and bind to the surfaces it is in contact with. The textile that your T-shirt is made of (likely cotton) contains cellulose, a polymer that has a high density of hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl groups will polymerize the cyanoacrylate in much the same way as hydroxide ions, but since there is a very high density of them in cellulose, the process takes place rapidly. Combine that with the fact that the polymerization of cyanoacrylates is exothermic, and you have a reaction that creates enough heat to decompose the cellulose or even ignite it, in optimal conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization</a></p>
<p>Basically the polymers in your shirt and glue decided that they could form a polymer that needs less energy to maintain than either the glue or the shirt by themselves. The difference in energies is released as heat in an exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens with shoe laces too. If you lose the little plastic wrapper from the end of a shoe lace, just drip some superglue on the end. It gets hot, it steams, it smells very acrid, but once it has finished doing that, you get a nice little stiff end that won't fray.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
