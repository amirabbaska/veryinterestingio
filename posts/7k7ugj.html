For much of human history wet-nurses have been used by women who couldn’t ( or didn’t want to ) feed their own children for various reasons.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Midwife here.  A few days after the birth of the baby, the hormonal changes from birth, along with the frequent suckling of the infant cause the “milk to come in”. This is when the mother gets her initial supply of milk.  After these first few days, milk supply works on supply and demand. This means that the more often a baby nurses or a mother pumps, the more milk is produced.  The same goes for nursing your friend’s, neighbor’s or sister’s baby.  The lactating animal can nurse whoever she wants.</p>
<p>The mothering instinct is strong and a mother dog, for example would often adopt a small kitten if the dog was already lactating.</p>
<p>Most wet-nurses, or adoptive nurses, initiated lactation from their own pregnancies and then nurses other offspring alongside their own baby or after their baby was weaned.  The supply of milk never dropped because suckling (demand) was as continuing, so most women could nurse indefinitely. </p>
<p>To make this more clear, to wean a baby, you gradually do fewer nursing sessions a day (usually when the baby starts eating food) and the milk supply goes away. </p>
<p>Also, of note, genetically some women produce milk more easily than others. Those would have been preferred as wet-nurses.</p>
<p>Sometimes women who have nursed in the last few years are able to trigger re-lactation with supplements, a few medications or simply nursing or pumping. </p>
<p>Women who have never been pregnant would likely need many hormones and meds to begin lactating.  I have heard from specialists that it is not easy or common to work well. Even if they were successful at getting some milk, it would not likely be a full supply.</p>
<p>Lactation works similarly in many species, the only difference is that dairy cows are bred for many years to be the best producers.</p>
<p>Any more specific questions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
