		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The doctrine of the Trinity is one of the least understood aspects of Christian theology, but by no means the least important. Theologians have wrestled for it for 2 millennia and it is still not fully understood, though many would argue there are aspects of God that we will never be able to understand, or wrap our minds around. Argument over the role of the Spirit is actually one of the leading causes for why the Eastern and Western churches split. The Western church believes the Father and Son (Jesus) breathe/send the Holy Spirit, while the Eastern church maintains that it is only the Father who breathes the Holy Spirit. The Trinity is often regarded as 3 persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and 1 substance (God). The doctrine is clearly open to criticism for being illogical and out of line with human reason, though most theologians will argue that human language and thought can't do justice to the transcendent God. Two terms are worth understanding: Perichoresis and Appropriation. Perichoresis basically says that the 3 persons of the Trinity maintain their own individuality while sharing in the life of the other 2 persons. This is seen as &quot;a community of being.&quot; Appropriation suggests that every person of the Trinity is present in the outward action of God, but it is &quot;appropriate&quot; to speak of 1 of the persons being responsible for different revelations throughout history. (Example: all 3 persons were present and took part in the Creation, but it is &quot;appropriate&quot; to speak of creation as the work of the Father) These two ideas together also help to reject Modalism (this is a belief that the Trinity can only appear as one Person at a time, think of ice, water, and water vapor)<br />
There are many analogies to how the Trinity works. Augustine suggested that it can be seen as a lover (the Father), the beloved (the Son), and the love (Holy Spirit) that unites the 2. This is a decent analogy but it tends to depersonalize the Holy Spirit and can cause us to view It as just that, an &quot;it&quot;.<br />
The actual functions of the Holy Spirit are generally agreed to focus on 3 areas: revelation, salvation, and the Christian life. Revelation: we need the Holy Spirit to discern truth about God. Salvation: the Spirit plays a role in establishing a relationship between Christ and the believer and uniting us to God (much in the same way it unites the Father and Son). The Christian Life: this takes place both in individuals and corporately (the Church as a whole) The Spirit brings unity to the Church, helps us to experience God in worship prayer, and devotion, and empowers/moves us to live a Christian life (think in terms of morality)  </p>
<p>This is not even a scratch on the surface of the current understanding of the Holy Spirit and Trinity in theology. I'm about to finish my bachelors in Christian Ministry and plan to go on to get a Masters of Divinity and Masters of Theology. One of the biggest problems is defining the terms, and every time you bring up a new term, there are more terms to define lol Specifically, it is pretty impossible to speak about the Holy Spirit without some understanding of the Trinity Also the majority of these descriptions come from Alister McGrath's &quot;Christian Theology&quot; and I apologize for butchering them!<br />
edit: There is some irony to the ELI5 Holy Spirit/ Trinity because it is one of the most complex doctrines of Christian Theology, and any simple answer given (including mine) is really an injustice to the true Holy Spirit lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question and you are going to hear a lot of different, contradicting answers since people have various beliefs and it's in our human nature to want to share these beliefs.</p>
<p>Allow me to take a different approach and answer your question from the Scriptures. It is described after all as God's word, and 2 Peter 1:21 says &quot;For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.&quot; Plus by specifying &quot;Christian context&quot; in your question, it will be right in line with Christ's pattern, which was to use the scriptures extensively, hence you will see both the old and the new testaments herein.</p>
<p>To address the last item of your question, is the holy spirit Jesus? Matthew 12:32 says &quot;For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.&quot; The Son of man is a usual title employed for Jesus. Here the idea is clear: sinning against Jesus can be forgiven, sinning against the holy spirit cannot.</p>
<p>Is it a person? The Bible compares the holy spirit to water. When promising future blessings for his people, God said: “I shall pour out water upon the thirsty one, and trickling streams upon the dry place. I shall pour out my spirit upon your seed, and my blessing upon your descendants.” (Isaiah 44:3). When God pours out his spirit upon his servants, they become “full of holy spirit,” or “filled with holy spirit.” Jesus, John the Baptist, Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and the disciples who were gathered together on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E. are all described as being full of, or filled with, holy spirit (Luke 1:15; 4:1; Acts 4:8; 9:17; 11:22, 24; 13:9). So it's not a person either.</p>
<p>Now check out Luke 11:9-13, Jesus says: &quot;So I say to you, keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you. For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened.  Indeed, which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion? Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!”.</p>
<p>Holy spirit is a thing that can be shared or given by God. Another aspect is found in Luke 1:35, when the angel Gabriel spoke to Mary and said &quot;In answer the angel said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God’s Son&quot;. So there is a clear connection between holy spirit and power from the Most High. </p>
<p>Indeed, Christ confirms the link in Acts 1:8 &quot;But you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.&quot; </p>
<p>In other words and to make it ELI5-compatible, holy spirit is the <em>power of God</em>, in action. Thus, with his holy spirit, God causes actions to be done.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, I am expecting people will disagree with this take of your ELI5. It's okay. I never claimed to be an expert in modern church theology. What I have done is using the Scriptures to answer your question. I will be happy to pursue this discussion as long as we focus on what the Scriptures teach, not what the doctrines churches teach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make a modern analogy:</p>
<p>God is the Developer of an MMO. He notices his players are misbehaving, and logs into the game as Jesus. He travels around as Jesus talking to people and preaching. He then gets lynched and killed by trolls. God resurrects Jesus and  walks around talking a bit more, then ascends him out of the game.</p>
<p>God keeps sending messages and buffs to players using  &quot;The Holy Spirit&quot; special account, which isn't his Jesus player account, but a fundamentally different sort of thing. This account doesn't have an Avatar in the game world, but acts more like a GM account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes the Holy Spirit is a person -- but not a person in the sense of a human being, but in the sense of an existing sentient being with a personality and (this is key) the ability to have discreet relationships with others.
No, it is not Jesus.</p>
<p>It's probably too late to help, but... there is just a lot of misinformation and bad understanding in this thread.</p>
<p>And yes -- it is true that different Christian churches and traditions have said different things about the Holy Spirit and the Trinity... but a lot of what is being said in this thread isn't any of those things. It's like bad understandings of poorly understood vaguely reformed evangelical theology, through the lens of American pop culture, through the lens of trying to explain things by analogy.</p>
<p>And to explain the differences in this thread as &quot;well, different Christians have understood it differently&quot; is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Christians on the planet, and throughout history, have been Roman Catholic, Orthodox (of various flavors), or Anglican. This accounts for damn near everyone. If you include Lutheranism and Reformed traditions, that's REALLY damn near everybody. And there is a substantial amount of agreement here.</p>
<p>According to all of these traditions, there is one God in Three Persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Many people in the thread (And many people today) will pile on the &quot;God&quot; language into the First Person (the Father) - but this is simply not accurate. All Three Persons are One God. When Christian pray to God, they pray to the Trinity. Thomas Aquinas even said that the &quot;Our Father&quot; is prayed to the Trinity as a whole, not to the First Person.</p>
<p>That's because &quot;God the Father&quot; is not &quot;God OUR Father,&quot; but rather &quot;the Person of God who is the Father of the Son.&quot; The names of the Trinity are indicative of their relationships TO EACH OTHER, not to us. The Father of the Son, the Son of the Father, their Holy Spirit: one God.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is a mystery that cannot really be explained. Rather, it is a set of words that were chosen to best express (though not fully express) the lived experience of the early Church.</p>
<p>So, with that little bit of groundwork... WHO is the Holy Spirit?</p>
<p>At the Last Supper, Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sending of the Holy Spirit is understood to have happened 50 days after the Resurrection, on Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit is said to have descended on the Apostles &quot;like tongues of fire&quot;. </p>
<p>We can also look back to the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament - OT) and see, for example, at the creation of the world in Genesis, &quot;the Spirit of God was upon the waters.&quot; There are many other OT references - for example, the &quot;Shekinah&quot; - the presence of God that hovered over the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>But what does any of that mean for who the Holy Spirit is?</p>
<p>There's two ways of thinking about this question: Who is the Holy Spirit within God, and who is the Holy Spirit to us?</p>
<p>It is commonly understood that all things which are true about God are true about all three persons. So (for example) even though we typically call God the Father the creator, all three create because all three are One God.</p>
<p>However, we assign certain actions and aspects or qualities of God to particular persons of the Trinity because (as Aquinas might say) they are logically proper to that person. So, we say that the Second Person (the Son) &quot;saves us,&quot; even though - really - it is the whole Trinity, the One God, who saves us.</p>
<p>We speak, then, of the Holy Spirit as the active power of God in creation and, especially, in the lives of human beings. We say that inspiration (creativity) is the work of the Spirit (notice in+spirit=inspiration). We say that prophets receive the Spirit. That the Spirit guides the Church in Truth (that is, keeps the Church from proclaiming heresy as doctrine).</p>
<p>These things are difficult to talk about, so you shouldn't feel dumb for not understanding them. And most analogies are within a hair's breadth of heresy.</p>
<p>Here are some analogies and ways of thinking about the Spirit. If taken too literally, and especially if taken individually in isolation, they can lead to error, but as many images, taken together held lightly, they might help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the Love between the Father and the Son</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the Begetting of the Begotten One (the Son) by the Begetter (the Father)</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the breath of God</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is God at work in the World</li>
</ul>
<p>Some issues/notes...</p>
<p>Second Temple Judaism (the Judaism of the time of Jesus) had a concept of the Deuteros Theos -- the &quot;second God.&quot; This was the Wisdom of God (the Sophia) as well as the Presence of God (the Shekina), the Word of God (Logos), and the Spirit/Breath of God (the Ruah, or the Pneuma). After the Jesus event and the destruction of the Second Temple, Rabbinical Judaism graphs all of the Deuteros Theos theology onto the Torah. So, Jews today might say things like &quot;God created the world through His Torah.&quot; </p>
<p>The Jewish and then Gentile followers of Jesus graphed most of that theology onto Christ. Christ became the Word (Logos) of God in John's Gospel, the Wisdom of God through whom God created the World. There was a time in early Christianity where there was no Trinitarian doctrine. And there was a time when the Holy Spirit was identified primarily with Jesus. Eventually some of the Deuteros Theos imagery became associated with the Holy Spirit. And when Protestants excised much of the late Wisdom literature from the Biblical Canon, some of the explicit connections between Wisdom and Christ were lost -- and so Wisdom often gets grafted onto the Holy Spirit in evangelicalism and Reformed traditions, even though Catholics and Oterthodox traditionally understand Wisdom to be Christ. (&quot;Since then she has appeared on earth, and moved among people. She is the book of the precepts of God, the law that endures forever; all who cling to her will live, but those will die who forsake her.&quot;) So... there is some confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
