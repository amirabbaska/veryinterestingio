<p>If you annihilate the atom with an antimatter atom, you could convert it all into energy in the form of EM radiation. It's technically possible, but you're more likely to get a whole bunch of other particles too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, the energy stored is equal to E=MC^2 or Energy is equal to mass times the Speed of light squared.</p>
<p>As for releasing 100% of the energy of matter, that can accomplished with antimatter. That isn't done, though, because</p>
<p>A) Antimatter is incredibly difficult to contain as it explodes violently whenever it contacts regular matter.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>B) It can only be made in exceedingly small quantities by using a particle accelerator.</p>
<p>So it takes as much energy to create antimatter as it releases (to get a nuclear sized explosion you would have to spend a nuclear bomb's worth of energy to create that much antimatter), and the difficulty in containment means any sort of failure in containment will cause it to detonate. Though, it would probably be impossible to store that much antimatter in one place in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy released from fission is actually quite different from the energy &quot;stored&quot; in the atom in the form of mass. Binding subatomic particles into large atoms requires energy, some of which is then released when the atom is split into smaller atoms.</p>
<p>The energy required to bind subatomic particles together is tiny when compared to the energy required to create the same particles from thin air. Hence, the energy that is released in fission is tiny when compared to the energy that is released in antimatter annihilation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several factors to take into account. One would be the constituents for example. Say we study a fusion process, a very common one would be H+H -&gt; He + rest, or more accurately you would use one of the isotopes, D or T. So, lets take a look at the process D+T -&gt; He + n, as you can find on Wikipedia [1].</p>
<p>The energy released in this process, that will be transferred to momentum of the final constituents, is the difference in mass. So, lets use the numbers we can find on Wikipedia for those masses and see what the difference is:</p>
<p>(m_D + m_T) - (m_He + m_n) = (2.01410178+3.0160492)-(1.00866491588+4.002602) [u] = 0.018884064119999877 [u]</p>
<p>So, as people have been saying, use E=mc^2 to find this in energy if you like, but to answer your question we only need to figure out how much mass is gone (m_lost/m_before = m_lost c^2 / (m_before c^2 ) = E_lost/E_before). That is:</p>
<p>((m_D + m_T) - (m_He + m_n)) /(m_D + m_T) = 0.018884064119999877/(2.01410178+3.0160492) = 0.0037541744164505926</p>
<p>that is about 0.374% of the original mass. So at least the &quot;not even 1%&quot; number is in the right ballpark. This differs for which processes you use.</p>
<p>Note also that the full (2.01410178+3.0160492) [u] = 5.03015098 [u] of before-mass is not easily accessible. Fusion and fission works so that you have some starting constituents and some final ones, D+T and He+n respectively above, and you use the difference in those masses to extract energy.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for &quot;How much energy [...] is it technically possible to 'extract'[?]&quot; then you would have to: Take some starting particles (above D+T), find a series of interactions (above one fusion reaction) that leads to a final state which has the least amount of mass possible. Basically, in some oversimplified terms, it is the binding energy of the constituents of the atoms themselves (in D for example, and proton and a neutron) that you access. </p>

<p>tl;dw Antimatter is way too impractical. Black holes are the way to go and have a efficiency of up to ~40% provided you have some sci-fi tech to catch gamma rays emitted from a near by black hole. Also: Cats are totally a unit of measurement!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
