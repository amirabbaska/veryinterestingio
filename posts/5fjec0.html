		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among other things, it's at about 4000 feet.  It's substantially cooler that high.  It's relatively close to the Mt. Lemmon ski area-- which is a couple hours <em>south</em> of Phoenix.  It sounds crazy that there's skiing in Arizona that's further south even than the fiery death-zone of Phoenix... but the change in altitude makes it possible.</p>
<p>Oracle is, on average, about 20 degrees cooler than Phoenix.</p>
<p>This probably doesn't explain all of it, but it does help explain why it's not quite as bad as &quot;a greenhouse in arizona&quot; might suggest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a ton of technology to keep it cool. They have a giant pond/lake inside to help trap heat. They have a large underground tunnel system that helps keep it cool and a massive artificial lung to allow the air pressure to rise and fall within the closed system. They do tours all the time there and it's quite the experience if you ever get the chance. Plus all the other location factors, Phoenix is a low desert Valley and gets incredibly hot but much of Arizona is middle desert and forest in higher elevations. The biosphere is located some here between these biomes and has a more temper climate relative to the rest of the state </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They likely have ways of regulating the temperature of the greenhouse. The easiest way is with the rain. If the temperatures are too high in the environment, they can lower the temperature of the water a little and cool the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
