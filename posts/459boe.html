		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I wrote my original answer in response to OP's question, but there still seems to be a lot of confusion. It might help if I write a bit of a summary about what gravitational waves actually <em>are</em>, and I'm adding that to the top here:</p>
<p><strong>What are gravitational waves?</strong> <strong>What is LIGO?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, gravity isn't just a &quot;force&quot; that pulls objects. Instead, you can think of space as like a sort of fabric, and that a large object will put a dent in the fabric, causing other objects to move in bent paths as they move through the bent fabric. You've probably seem <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lP0Bnii.jpg" target="_blank">images like this</a> before, though this is a loose metaphor, and you shouldn't take it too seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gravitational waves are a &quot;wave&quot; in this fabric. Like any fabric, a big jolt will cause a shock to flow along it. Something like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXlg3cr-q44?t=29" target="_blank">colliding black holes</a> will do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gravitational wave is a wave of <em>stretching</em> and <em>contracting</em>. Along the wave, space gets squished and unsquished again. A circular object becomes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/asNxPe4.gif" target="_blank">a little bit oval</a> This effect is very very small - it's happening all the time and we don't notice it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We built machines that fires lasers over several kilometres to measure tiny changes in that distance, to detect the tiny effects of gravitational waves. It's so sensitive, it can measure changes in length down to less than the size of a proton. They built two in opposite corners of the US, but there are other ones being built around the world. The American ones recently got an upgrade. The American machines are called LIGO, and they've now been upgraded to &quot;Advanced LIGO&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And these upgraded machines actually detected gravitational waves!</p>
</li>
<li>We've had a long time to think about what pattern of wibbles a gravitational wave from colliding black holes should look like, and it turns out the waves we found look exactly like what we were expecting! Even more specifically, we can say how big these black holes were, and about how far away they were - about 30x the mass of our Sun each, and about billion light years away.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>And then, to answer the original question: why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Two big things!</p>
<p>Firstly, General Relativity has always predicted that gravitational waves should exist. However, they are very weak, and even the most sensitive detectors should only detect the most dramatic ones - the &quot;chirp&quot; of gravitational waves that comes from the merger of two neutron stars, or even better, two black holes.</p>
<p>Recently, the LIGO detectors have been upgraded so that they finally have the sensitivity to detect the strongest of gravitational waves. And a few months ago, both sets of detectors (one in Louisiana, one in Washington state) detected a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw" target="_blank">chirp</a> of gravitational waves, fitting exactly the pattern of frequencies you'd expect from the merger of two black holes about a billion light years away with a mass of about 30x our Sun each.</p>
<p><strong>This detection is a massive confirmation of General Relativity</strong>. It would be worrying if we didn't detect anything, but this really confirms that our understanding of gravity and the universe is correct.</p>
<p>Secondly, this opens up an entirely new field of observational astronomy. Astronomy works mostly through telescopes that observe different types of light waves - visible light, infrared, x-rays, radio waves, etc. But gravitational waves are an entirely different thing, and they give us a wholly new point of view on the universe, letting us see things we couldn't see otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, something that's 30x the mass of our Sun is a pretty small object to see at a distance of a billion light years! Black holes are also really really small (these are like 90 km across). So we detected something less than 100 km across that was a billion light years away! And that's something that would be pretty much impossible to do with any other current method.</p>
<p><strong>It really is a wholly new window into the universe.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since I actually tried to explain this to a pair of 5-year-olds today, I figure why not share :)</p>
<p>You know how when you throw a rock in a pool, there are ripples? And how if we throw bigger rocks in, they make bigger ripples?</p>
<p>Well, a long time ago, a really smart guy named Einstein said that stars and planets and stuff <em>should</em> make ripples in space, and he used some really cool math to explain why he thought that. Lots of people checked the math and agree that he was right.</p>
<p>But we've never been able to <em>see</em> those ripples before. Now some people built a really sensitive measuring thing that uses lasers to see them, and they just proved that their device works by seeing ripples from a <em>really</em> big splash. So now we know how to see them and we can get better at it, which will help us learn more about space.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> build-&gt;built, work-&gt;works</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the observations of our universe so far have been based on observing different types of light waves. X-Rays, infrared, optical its all light waves. Gravitational waves however, are not light waves. They are emitted by various Astrophysical sources, and we can use them to get information about their sources. This is an ENTIRELY new way in which to view the universe. This is going to be a completely new field, and who knows what we are going to observe with this new method of astronomy. The excitement in Physics/Astrophysics is genuinely massive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things with mass and/or energy distort spacetime (which is what gravity truly is). When they move, they make ripples in spacetime like a boat moving in water. These waves will stretch and compress spacetime as they pass, moving at the speed of light. They are detected using lasers set up so that they cancel each other out. If a gravitational wave passes through, the lasers won't cancel each other out, and you'll get a signal. </p>
<p>It's another medium that we could use to detect messages, but it's a long shot that we'd find anything, like SETI. Right now, all we can detect are the biggest waves coming from black holes, and we can't send messages via gravity, but this is the first step towards something like Interstellar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically you can think of this experiment as that of detecting a pin drop at the 50 yard line during an NFL game, and your detection equipment is five states over and in the back of a van down by the river. We're watching the game on a little shitty TV in the back of the van, and we've been told by the announcer that a pin was dropped on the 50 yard line, but we have no way of actually seeing it because its obviously too tiny, our TV is too shitty, and the noise is too loud. </p>
<p>TL;DR- Confirms a bunch of science shit about what we think we know about the universe</p>
