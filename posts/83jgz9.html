		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The type of pain is an indication of what kind of injury you have. It's your brain categorizing what's happening. For example if you have a sore muscle it's probably dull because your brain knows it's pain, but it's not an immediate danger pain. Then take stinging pain. Those are meant to warn you of something immediate or major. Like if you step on a broken hanger you have a stinging that says &quot;stop stepping on a hanger you idiot and remove your foot immediately&quot; it's evolutionary to tell you the extent of pain and the severity and immediateness of the injury</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the record, I’m an undergrad who took a neurobiology course. This answer is going to involve a lot of oversimplification. </p>
<p>There are nerve endings on your skin, joints, and organ walls dedicated to receiving information about any stimulus (temperature, pressure, etc) that is harmful to the body— these are called nociceptors. </p>
<p>Nociceptors have nerve fibers— long thin strands that connect the nerve ending to the spinal cord, and these signal further to the brain, allowing information to be communicated back and forth between the nerve endings and the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).</p>
<p>There are multiple types of these nerve fibers, majorly: A_delta fibers and C fibers. </p>
<p>A_delta fibers are insulated (protected with a layer like rubber on a wire cable) and sensitive fibers that transmit information quickly. They have a low-threshold or tolerance for pain.</p>
<p>C_fibers are not insulated, and as such, are not as efficient in transmitting data. They communicate information (let’s call it a signal) much slower than A_delta fibers, and have a higher tolerance/threshold.</p>
<p>When you get hurt, say pricked by a needle, your faster, sensitive A_delta fibers are activated  and tell the central nervous system, “HEY, SOME SHIT IS HAPPENING HERE!” Thus, you get this sharp, stabbing pain from these low-tolerance fibers rapidly sending information. Then later, C-fibers activate, and with their higher threshold and lower sensitivity, they give you that dull ache over time.</p>
<p>To go one step further, it’s theorized that there are a bunch of “gates” that the signal needs to pass through. These “gates” include larger, wide nerve fibers that carry non-pain information, and it’s theorized that the central nervous system “chooses” what nerve fiber to activate based how strong the signal is, what other information is available (back to temperature, pressure), changing how the pain is processed. </p>
<p>For example: One of these supposed “gates” is an A_beta fiber, different from the A_delta. This A_beta fiber is wider and carries information generally about pressure. When activated, A_beta fibers can slow down (or amplify) the signalling between the central nervous system and nociceptors, thereby decreasing (or increasing) pain.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever heard of TENS units, they apply the gate-control theory to stimulate these larger, non-pain nerve fibers to slow down the pain signalling to treat both acute and chronic pain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Has to do with the &quot;cutting&quot; of nerve endings: which usually gives you the stinging pain we all know and love (/s) after superficial trauma, such as scraping your elbow during a fall. The nerve endings are located in the dermis of the skin, which gets scraped away, taking the nerve endings with it. Dull pain is where blunt trauma leaves the nerve endings intact, but there is still constant activation of the pain sensing nerves through hematoma formation, or oedema (from cell destruction or other), or a host of other factors.</p>
<p>TL;dr: intact VS non intact nerve endings cause the difference is pain sensation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question and I have answer for you. I used to be a mixed martial artist and I was also instructor and during that period I saw enough injuries to get me interested in medicine. I wanted to be able to help people first so I wanted to learn about pain, and I ended learn a lot about how we and how our body classifies pain. </p>
<p>So the first thing I learned was that the human body’s nervous system is ridiculously complex but in many ways our most important. It is in charge of injuries, sensations, itches, temperature, pains and so many more functions we use day to day and it’s job is to provide important data to the brain. Think about each point in your nervous system as a weird button that when triggered in a certain way sends information to your brain, but the information is isn’t like a light switch (on or off) it’s a series of “data points” that give you brain the ability to see without your eyes. You know how you can feel the shape of something small in your hand without looking at it, that’s because those sensors are finely tuned to be super accurate in that part of the body so we can feel around and get data. Well this goes for pain as well. We are designed not to like pain because it indicates to our brain that we just did something to our body that is bad. </p>
<p>Now the thing is pain is all well and good but our nervous system is also designed to provide data, not just pain, we are meant to be able to use the pain and the associated data to avoid doing whatever we did to hurt ourselves, and that’s why there is more than one type of pain. For example; if you’re hiking and you fall in a thorny bush and on a rock you may feel small sharp sensations to indicate to your brain “avoid this bush” but you will also get an a sensation of a wide and thud like pain that tells you “avoid rock.” This is all within the nervous system trying to teach you not to fall on painful things. But there are times when what seems like the same injury gives you two different feelings. As awesome and accurate as you body can be, it has its limitations. A great example of this is that your body often interprets the feeling of cold and the feeling of wet on parts of your body as the same feeling. Because using all the sensors your brain can’t decode the signals and you are forced to use other clues to tell the brain what happened. </p>
<p>Now I have found there is more than half a dozen different flavors of pain someone may experience during an injury that range from specific to a pin point location to falling and bruising a big area and even if the pain means nothing to you, to a doctor it may mean a lot more. Telling a doctor you experience a sharp pain may give them the information your nervous system has been trying to tell you and help them diagnose if the pain is associated with a bruise, or maybe it’s in your muscle, or a join or a bone, or in fatty tissue. Truthfully we have grown out of the need to understand all these pains ourselves because we no longer use them for survival like we may have once needed them. </p>
<p>Now getting back to your original question of why the feelings of pain can be different, the answer is that your body has classified those two injuries as separate dangers to avoid. Even if objectively they are the same injury, one may have triggered your nervous system in a different way than the other, one may be effect an inner muscle group, where as another could be effecting an outer muscle group. There are lots of situations why the body is getting different readings but that’s all that is. Your body is interpreting feelings in order to tell you all it can about the present danger, and ultimately keep you alive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
