		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, no. Unvaccinated people are indeed at the highest risk, however, while vaccines are very effective, no vaccine is 100% effective. Most childhood vaccines protect between 85 and 99 percent of the population. For some reason, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm" target="_blank">a small percentage of folks who are vaccinated do not develop immunity</a>.  This hasn't traditionally been much of an issue because with the vast majority of the population vaccinated for a particular disease, we develop &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity" target="_blank">herd immunity</a>.&quot; The more folks are vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread, and so epidemics become less likely. </p>
<p>Another issue (though not strictly what you asked) is that some children cannot receive the vaccine. Often this is because they have a compromised immune system thanks to a genetic disorder, or active cancer treatment. While these children cannot receive the protection of the vaccine, they <em>can</em> indeed receive the protection afforded by herd immunity. Unfortunately, as more people choose not to vaccinate their children, immunocompromised are put in particularly bad risk. In the case of measles, these children<a href="http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/diseases-and-illnesses/measles/protecting-children-who-cant-be-immunised-against-measles" target="_blank"> have up to a 50% mortality rate</a>. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One additional point that a lot of people miss:</p>
<p>People who are immunocompromised (due to HIV, some cancers and cancer treatments, certain genetic conditions, anti-rejection drugs, and some other medications) are at elevated risk <em>even if they have already been vaccinated.</em> </p>
<p>This group is usually brought up in the context of 'populations that can't be vaccinated'. Yes, it's true that people who are severely immunocompromised usually can't be vaccinated. But even people who had their shots as kids and developed effective immunity are at risk if they later go on to develop an immunocompromising condition.</p>
<p>All a vaccine does is teach your immune system how to respond to a pathogen. You still need your immune system to be in good working order when it comes time to actually mount that response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to small children who can't be vaccinated yet &amp; have an underdeveloped immune system (newborns &amp; infants), you also have the elderly who often have not kept up on their boosters &amp; also have a compromised immune system. Those who cannot be immunized for health reasons rely on herd immunity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccination isn't a cure, it's about building a global community that's immune to a certain strain of the germ so that it has no more new hosts to infect and no chances of letting the germ mutate to a new strain. Even that's not possible because of a large number of people with compromised immune systems (<em>think cancer patients including babies and elderly folks</em>). </p>
<p>By also not giving any new hosts, you're reducing the chance of the germ mutating to fight the immunity. By not vaccinating the kids, you're letting measles to mutate to a new strain that WILL infect the vaccinated kids because the vaccination is only for certain strains of measles. </p>
<p>The closest thing you can do to reduce or eliminate a bug like this is to leave it no more new hosts to infect. That's why Eloba outbreak didn't get so widespread, we reacted in time to reduce any more new infections by not giving it any more hosts. </p>
<p>Think about what will happen if measles mutates to a new strain that no kids on the planet will be protected from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an extra layer on top of the pure medical science. People that are against vaccination tend to flock together - e.g. villages full of people following specific faith. So the diseases have a good beachfront to establish and then spread because these people don't live in isolation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
