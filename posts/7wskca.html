		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a student ask how empty space is, and I told them I really did not know. So, in an area like the orbital path between Earth and Mars (leaving out human space junk) how many objects would you find? Any? None? added question, if anyone knows: How much stuff is in true outer space - beyond out solar system, how often might you encounter an object of any size? Thanks<br />
<strong>EDIT: Thank you for all the top-notch replies! You guys really know your stuff!</strong></p></div></div>

For example, Ceres alone is estimated to hold about a third of the asteroid belt's mass even though the asteroid belt is much denser than most of the space between planets.</p>
<p>All in all space is mostly just empty with scattered planets, stars, nebulas and dust. If it weren't empty we wouldn't be able to take such clear images of galaxies that are billions of lightyears away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space is mostly a much better vacuum than we can produce here on earth. 100km away from earth, space begins, and pressure is 10^-7 torr. But even as far away as the moon, will earths atmosphere give orbiting objects a significant friction. At that distance the atmospspheric pressure is down to 10^-10 torr, which is pretty much the best vacuum you can make on earth. Outside the solar system (and away from the solar wind) the pressure drops to 10^-15 torr.</p>
<p>10^-11 torr equals 10^-9 Pa, and gives you 4x10^12 molecules/m^3  a mean free path of 10 000 km.</p>
<p>So the Tesla would hit 8*10^23 molecules/m^2 of paint. This would build up a 0.015mm thick layer of dust if it sticks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's (from small to large) an interplanetary dust cloud (micrometeoroids), meteoroids and small (otherwise we'd 've seen them) asteroids  ... enough of it all in any case for over ten thousand tonnes of interplanetary stuff to enter Earth's atmosphere each year. Also, Mars has two small moons,  Phobos and Deimos orbiting it. Oh, and apparently, between Earth and Mars, there' also a car (or would that be categorised as '<em>human space junk</em>'?). :)</p>
<p>edit: There are also what are called <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/MarsTrojans.html" target="_blank">'<em>Trojans</em>'</a> orbiting ahead and behind Mars, the largest of them known as '<em>5261 Eureka</em>'.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably depends of your definition of 'stuff'. Interstellar space apparently contains something on the order of 1 atom per cubic centimetre on average. <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/DaWeiCai.shtml" target="_blank">https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/DaWeiCai.shtml</a></p>
<p>As for larger objects, see this earlier Reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44fyo7/how_empty_is_interstellar_space/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44fyo7/how_empty_is_interstellar_space/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a chunk of space, 1km x 1km x 40 trillion km.</p>
<p>At 1 atom per cubic cm, there would be about 66 kilos of hydrogen between us and the nearest star in that 1x1 km slice.</p>
<p>For interstellar travel, This may not sound like much... but its a nearly insurmountable challenge.  At near light speed, a 1km x 1km ship would convert nearly all that mass into energy.  The largest nuke on earth only converted about 2.67 kilos of mass into pure energy. The ablation shield would need to protect the equivalent force of at least 25 Tsar bombas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
