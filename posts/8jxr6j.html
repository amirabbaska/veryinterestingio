		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Johnson:</p>
<p>Johnson meaning the penis appears to be part of a group that uses a proper name, in this case based on 'John', to give a slang name to the male genitals. Others of the type include John Henry, John Thomas, John Willie, Master John Goodfellow, Sir John and Uncle John. And there is john itself:</p>
<p>1914 T.S. Eliot ‘Fragments’ in Inventions of the March Hare: O daughter dear daughter I think you are a fool / To run against a man with a john like a mule.</p>
<p>The first use of johnson is mid-19th century:</p>
<p>1863 W. Cheadle Journal 2 Feb.: Bitterly cold; neck frozen. Face ditto; thighs ditto; Johnson ditto, &amp; sphincture vesicae partially paralysed.</p>
<p>The first uses of this 'proper name' form seem to stem from the 16th century jockum, here used in one of the earliest collections of criminal slang terms:</p>
<p>c.1566 Harman Caveat for Common Cursetours: There was a proud Patrico and a nosegent, he tooke his Jockam in his famble, and a wapping he went.</p>
<p>Jockum led to jock, which is still found, typically in old school rap lyrics, although its original use is much older and serves for both sexes:</p>
<p>a.1790 H.T. Potter New Dict. Cant (1795): jock private parts of a man or woman.</p>
<p>Jack, as used for penis, also appears to have similar roots in a proper name, but in fact puns on the standard English jack, a device for lifting. Thus:</p>
<p>1604 Dekker Honest Whore Pt 1 I i: [He] taught her to play upon the Virginals, and still his Jacks leapt up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dick:</p>
<p>The word connoted a person of questionable character long before it became a nickname for the penis. For example, in the 1665 satire The English Rogue by Richard Head, an unsavory character is referred to as a &quot;dick&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;The next Dick I pickt up for her was a man of a colour as contrary to the former, as light is to darkness, being swarthy; whose hair was as black as a sloe; middle statur'd, well set, both strong and active, a man so universally tryed, and so fruitfully successful, that there was hardly any female within ten miles gotten with child in hugger-mugger, but he was more than suspected to be Father of all the legitimate.&quot;</p>
<p>An 1869 slang dictionary offered definitions of dick including &quot;a riding whip&quot; and an abbreviation of dictionary, also noting that in the North Country, it was used as a verb to indicate that a policeman was eyeing the subject. The term came to be associated with the penis through usage by men in the military around the 1880s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Online Etymology Dictionary:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/johnson" target="_blank">Johnson</a>: perhaps related to British slang John Thomas, which has the same meaning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Peter" target="_blank">Peter</a>: Slang for &quot;penis&quot; is attested from 1902, probably from identity of first syllable. </li>
<li>Willy isn't there...</li>
<li><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/dick" target="_blank">Dick</a>: The meaning &quot;penis&quot; is attested from 1891 in Farmer's slang dictionary (possibly British army slang).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, for some dates, the earliest known usage of each (according to the OED) is</p>
<ul>
<li>1863 for Johnson (&quot;Neck frozen. Face ditto; tights ditto; Johnson ditto, &amp; sphincter vesicae partially paralyzed.&quot;, Journal of a trip across Canada. See /u/Big_Election's post for a link)</li>
<li>1870 for Peter (&quot;For men must slum, and women will try To gain a small pittance by walking the High, While Peter stiff is standing.&quot;, Cythera's Hymnal)</li>
<li>1905 for Willy (&quot;Willy, the male organ; a slang name for a child's penis. Cum. [Cumberland], Wm. [Westmoreland]&quot;, English Dialect Dictionary)</li>
<li>1891 for Dick (&quot;(military) - The penis&quot;, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/slangitsanalogue02farmuoft#page/280/mode/1up" target="_blank">Slang and its Analogues</a>)</li>
