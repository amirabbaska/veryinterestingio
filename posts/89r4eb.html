		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of this has to do with your mouth coming into contact with the steel when you are drinking out of the metal container. I have a stainless water bottle with a plastic cap and mouthpiece that tastes fine, but drinking out of a s’well bottle(fancy trendy vacuum bottle with mostly pall metal construction) feels like you are making out with the tin man. This is due to the fact that your tongue and lips is in direct contact and makes a strong taste. That being said, even without a plastic mouthpiece there could be some flavor from stainless steel. Small amounts of metals are known to leach out from stainless steel cookware after repeated use. If the steel is of poor quality, it could easily create off flavors. As for safety, I’m sure you have nothing to worry about if you are using a reputable source. Real food grade stainless steel is very safe, and any metal it leaches out is probably a small enough concentration to not cause health problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

2.If it is lead you should not drink it due to partial reaction with salts in water.</p>
<p>It is safe to drink if it is not in a lead container. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metal ions are positive, so electrons are attracted to them. electrons in the water are attracted to the container, making the water have a slight positive charge. metals usually have a slight positive charge, so the taste is associated with metals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that when something &quot;tastes metallic&quot;, that what you're tasting is based on odor alone (due to retronasal olfaction, which is basically smelling something as you swallow it) and not anything your tongue is picking up. Humans don't have any taste receptors for elemental iron or carbon. So technically it's more of a &quot;flavor&quot; than a &quot;taste&quot;. Metallic odors come from reactions on the surface, though I couldn't tell you precisely what reactions are happening in this case.</p>
<p>As for the safety: Steel is an alloy made from iron and carbon, along with a variety of trace elements depending on what purpose the steel is meant for. Iron is perfectly fine, it has nutritional use in your body. Carbon is also quite safe, and is not very reactive at all in this form. Regardless, most of your body is made of carbon so even if it was absorbed it would not be disrupting any of your chemical processes. Too much of anything is not great for you, of course, but that's probably not going to happen from a metal container.</p>
<p>The only possible risk is from the other trace metals used in the steel. However, since presumably you are using a container that's designed to come into contact with food/drink, the alloy would not be designed to contain any dangerous additives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
