		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap doesn't really &quot;break down&quot; oils.  It acts as a connector between water and oil.  Water is polar and oil is nonpolar.  Soap has a polar end and a nonpolar end so it acts as a hitch between the two and allows water to wash away with the oil attached.  If blackheads are too deep then they won't be pulled away by just water running over them cause they're stuck in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason why wet paint is affected more by paint thinner than paint that's already dried.  One is a simple matter of dilution, the other needs time to actually dissolve.</p>
<p>Soap can cut through fresh, surface oils without much trouble.  But the old, packed-in oils buried in a blackhead are a lot tougher.  Soap would need a lot longer than a simple wash to make any headway against it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blackheads are usually deep and the follicle too impacted to be removed by simple brushing with soap. You can remove them by using an ultrasonic scrubber or by squeezing them out.</p>
<p>But take care if you do squeeze them out. Make sure you have gloves on and your nails are cut. Also be sure to keep the follicle clean with a post extraction solution as well. I don't recommend you do this yourself unless you're trained to.</p>
<p>Do not use pore strips. They are too rough and leave the follicle open for more debris and also leaves it bigger than before.</p>
<p>If you don't want to do this yourself then go to an esthetician who can help remove blackheads.</p>

I haven’t tried it, but oil cleaning your face is supposed to help a ton with breaking down then down and removing them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
