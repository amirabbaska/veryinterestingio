		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Questions in Spanish are not dictated by the way the wording is used. In English, the way it's worded indicates whether it's a question or not. For example, &quot;are you going to the store&quot; vs &quot;you are going to the store&quot; have two different meanings, despite utilizing the exact same words in each phrase. The difference comes in where the words &quot;are&quot; and &quot;you&quot; are placed. Therefore, the punctuation isn't as important in English as the question is derived from the wording. In Spanish, the phrasing of a sentence does not require structure. The &quot;are&quot; and &quot;you&quot; can almost go anywhere in the sentence and it will not change the meaning. What will change it however is the inflection in the voice. Spanish speakers tend to get higher pitched as they speak of they're asking a question (I.e. start the question in their normal voice and end the sentence a little higher pitched). Thus, if you are reading Spanish, the &quot;upside down&quot; punctuation helps the reader know that the sentence is a question and the voice needs to show this. </p>
<p>Edit: Inflection, not reflection of the voice</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have shown well how useful the question-marker is, but from a developmental perspective, Latin used a particle -ne, usually attached to the first word of a question sentence that didn't use a specific interrogative word, to mark the same thing. The move from a voiced particle to punctuation is a function of increased literacy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use the same order of words in Italian to form the interrogative as the demonstrative. Vocal inflections clue the listener. This is true across all of the Romance languages with Spanish the only users of bracketed punctuation. I like it and think this should be adapted by all cultures. It's logical and easily learned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
