		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few possibilities as to how this is done.</p>
<p>A) As it has already been said: Buildings are designed to limit the spread of fire. Usually buildings are divided into fire sections within which a fire should be contained. This is mainly achieved by utilizing non-flammable materials with have the necessary qualities to not only contain the fire, but also prevent the transmission of excessive heat and the permeation of smoke.</p>
<p>B) Active fire suppression systems such as sprinkler systems and gaseous suppression systems.</p>
<p>C) A dedicated fire fighting water line. Depending on building code and building type it may be necessary to provide a high pressure water line for fire fighters to use. The problem is that there is a limit as to how far you can pump water up with a single pump</p>
<p>E:</p>
<p>D) I forgot hand held fire fighting systems, but they're more for small scale fires and/or immediate response instead of a major fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They go inside, and set up 'base camp' a few floors below the fire. Modern high-rises are designed to slow fires from spreading within them - although in the tragedy discussed in the news article the fire protection was circumvented by flammable materials (cladding and insulation, added after the building was originally constructed) on the outside of the building.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most high rises built in the U.S. have standpipe systems, to which firefighters can attach attack lines, attached to fire pumps that can pressurize the pipes with water once a valve is opened. A fire engine will typically hook up to the FDC near the fire pump to provide extra pressure or take over completely should the pump fail. Depending on the fire department and the condition of the building, the type of elevators, and how high up the fire is firefighters can use elevators to get within a couple of floors of the fire, or they use the stairwell of the building to reach a spot below the fire floor, attach the lines to the standpipe then haul the hose up the stairwell to the fire floor to being suppression operations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The International Building Code (IBC) is the base building code for the vast majority of the US. It has multiple fire protection requirements for high rise buildings. A hire rise is defined by the code as a building with an occupied floor more 75 feet above the fire department vehicle access. I was always taught this was the threshold because a 100 foot ladder leaning at the proper angle only reached 75 feet.
Highrise buildings are required to have a fire command center (FCC). The FCC is a special room where the fire fighters can go to provide command and control. It is required to have the fire alarm control panel, building plans, fire pump status, and generator status, among other stuff. As others have said the firefighters go in the building. The IBC also requires buildings over 120 feet to have a designated fire fighter access lobby. This lobby joins the fire service elevator to a stairtower equipped with a standpipe. Newer editions of the code require two fire service access elevators. This provides a safe staging area for the firefighters.
If the building is in excess of 420 feet shit gets real, An additional stairtower is required or an occupant egress elevator is required (I've never done one of those).
In regards to the pumping, fire pumps in high rise are required to be fed from two different city streets. If you're building happens to be in a seismic area then you need an onsite secondary water supply (The last one I did was 52,000 gallons).
TL;DR Highrise buildings have systems to assist the firefighters with interior attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern buildings have</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fire lifts have a keyswitch overrding the light barrier that would keep the door open if a limb or sooty smoke trips the sensors (reason why its not allowed to use lifts in emergencies), allowing them to quickly approach the site while keepin exits open, they exit a couple floors below.</p>
</li>
<li>a hardlined standpipe allowing water from groundlevel to be pumped to the top</li>
</ul>
<p>Usualy firefighters bring a couple of hoses with them to the site and attack it from the standpipe if possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
