		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitelly to charge from low to around 85%</p>
<p>The conversion is not 100% efficient, more like 70-90% depending on the crappiness of the circuit inside. The efficiency is more in the 80% usually, but that is not the main issue.</p>
<p>The efficiency is depending on the load, that's it, the power going out. It kinda look like an inverted U, where the peak is somewhere between half and 3/4 load, but can greatly change from device to device. The lower end is usually low efficiency and the upper end is higher. For example, 1/4 load could be 70%, peak at 3/4 load at 85% and be 80% at full load. Already you see that a low current draw waste more.</p>
<p>But that is not all, the circuit itself consume some power no matter how much current flow. The led for example waste the same power since it is always on, same with some other circuit inside.</p>
<p>Now, why 85% charge? Because that is about the upper limit of the bulk charge. The battery reached it's maximum voltage and now the current start to drop, lowering the load. Now both devices start to have a worse ratio of power transfered vs power consumed by each. remember the phone use power too.</p>
<p>edit: power bank constant current + phone constant current + PB voltage regulator efficiency + Cell voltage regulator/charger efficiency...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the end state is what? Fully depleted both battery and bank? Then connect first, let the bank drain first, and then internal battery. </p>
<p>Otherwise you discharge, recharge, and again discharge the internal battery. Charging is not 100% efficient, some energy is lost as heat. So by avoiding unnecessary recharging you save energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
