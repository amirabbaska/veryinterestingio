		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with wildlife in a rehab clinic and I can tell you, though not with exact science, that we use light to convince the animals it's night or day. </p>
<p>For example, if we want to do surgery on an animal or an examination, we'll change the lighting to make it passive before we sedate it. This convinces the animal it's either day or night, depending on the normal schedule of the animal, and they relax. We then sedate them with a gas and do our thing. After the surgery, if they're capable and cleared by the vets, we'll put them back in their cage and alter the lights to their feeding time. We don't feed prior to surgery, so if possible, we like to give them something to boost their energy and spirits after. </p>
<p>We also use light to control behaviour. If a bird escapes their cage, we'll turn off all the lights to stop it from panicking and flying to a light source (what they perceive to be the sun or sky) and hurting itself. For diurnal animals during cleaning, we'll place them in a kennel cab and cover it completely, convincing the animal it's night time and it'll go to sleep. Vice versa for nocturnal animals.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this answers your question at all on perception of time, but to me it is evidence that, unlike humans, an animal's perception can be manually controlled via light and darkness.</p>
<p>EDIT: Shamelessly plugging wildlife care on my popular comment! If you see any wild animal that is behaving erratically, not following a known pattern (nocturnal animal out wandering during the day for example), or that looks malnourished or in anyway distressed, please contact your local wildlife centre or animal control. We can easily coexist with wildlife, and there's no reason to let an animal suffer when help is just a phone call away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think OP wants to know if animals <em>feel</em> time differently, not if they tell time differently. Kind of like how you perceive time to go by faster when you're asleep. </p>
<p>As for an answer, there have been studies that suggest that time perception correlates with metabolic rate (or for a 5 year old, how much their body moves). So a highly active fly perceives time to be much slower than a hibernating bear.</p>
<p>This would be a good read for you:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without being able to get too deep into it (and not 100% what you're after) - animals do have a built-in clock. I don't know if it's universal but many animals will adopt an approximately 24 hour wake/sleep cycle even in the absence of light. The circadian rhythm is driven by the brain. You can extend or shorten it to a degree by artificially controlling light exposure but only by a certain amount.</p>
<p>Fun fact: while humans' (and many animals) circadian rhythm is reset by light entering our eyes, ducks also have light sensitive neurons <em>in their brain</em> related to circadian rhythm. That means that a blind duck would still adopt a day/night cycle aligned with the rising and setting of the sun because enough light passes through their skull to activate those cells.</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to say how animals actually perceive time, though. I'm curious - what exactly do you mean by that? What kinds of descriptions are you expecting to see?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can share my observations about my two housecats. I am a stay at home mom so I get a lot of time to stare at them.</p>
<p>They do seem to have a perception of time, and certainly of routines.</p>
<p>Just this morning, I had an empty house so I slept really late, until 9:15 when usually I am up at 6-7. Both cats were waiting outside the bedroom when I came out, which is unusual, usually only my favorite one is waiting. (Sorry, its true, he's the cat with a better personality.) </p>
<p>Both were waiting though because I was running late and the food bowl was empty, so both had to air their grievances. They certainly do get the routine of the house, and expect when I should emerge so they have some perception of things happening on time.</p>
<p>When we have gone away on vacation for a week or so, when we come both both cats act weird and certainly notice we were gone for a long time as well.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that dogs can sense time by smell.  Say I leave for work at 8am.  There is a certain point in the day where my smell dissipates from the home to a point where my dog knows I'll be coming home soon.</p>
<p>So I'm sure with similar creatures they can make a schedule depending on what smells come and go</p>
