		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is performed in sheep and cattle through a process known as juvenile in vitro embryo transfer (JIVET), in order to make quicker genetic gains by shortening the generation interval and producing more offspring with desirable genes. Basically the development of the immature eggs is stimulated by injecting reproductive hormones; the eggs are then harvested and implanted into mature recipient animals. I can't see how this would ever be useful or ethical in people though.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The eggs aren't active. They're in the primordial follicle stage. Even if you could get sperm to reach it, the egg or oocyte isn't viable for actually producing a child. Additionally, the uterus isn't able to actually hold and nurture a child before the menarche (first period) because the hormones that make the uterus fill with nutrients aren't there yet. Only when the menstrual cycle starts, (and hence puberty), does the uterus become viable to hold a child. And this coincidence with the first development of the first viable egg. The development of the egg from primordial follicle to a viable oocyte causes the cells to create hormones which make the uterus become viable. </p>
<p>So, no puberty = no viable egg + no working uterus. </p>
<p>tl;dr: The eggs aren't ready yet. When they are ready, the child will have started puberty.</p>
<hr />
<p>The genetic data is there, so maybe you could take it out, put it in the cell of a viable oocyte from a third donor, and you can have three-donor babies? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the female menstrual cycle is that each month one (usually) egg matures and then is released by the ovary into the Fallopian tube.   When women go through egg harvesting for IVF, they are given fertility drugs to induce the ovary to mature multiple eggs in the same cycle, then those eggs can be harvested once they're mature. Only mature eggs can be used for IVF.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The eggs aren’t fully developed yet so they’re still in an immature stage. </p>
<p>Longer answer if you know a little bio, they’re frozen part of the way through the cell cycle (as in, prophase/metaphase/anaphase/telophase) and they all only progress further during puberty. After that, every month during the menstrual cycle a few eggs move even further down the cell cycle and “wait” to be fertilized or they can’t actually complete the transition to finish up that process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
