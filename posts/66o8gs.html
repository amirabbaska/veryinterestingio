However, when I heard the shoe squeak again and realized it was a just a shoe, it did not hurt at all. Why does my perception of where the noise is coming from change how I hear it? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your perception is entirely gated by your attention. All of your senses are firing at 100% all of the time and this world is constantly throwing sensations your way.</p>
<p>So much sensations, in fact, that we can only attend to so many. Attention is a resource that we can only use so much of at any time. Imagine, if you will, if your body held no priority over sensations and all sounds, touches, tastes and smells were regarded equally. You would be adrift in a veritable sea of white noise, incapable of gathering anything meaningful from your environment due to sheer sensory overload and attention all shortage.</p>
<p>Luckily your body has a gating mechanism that dictates what sensations are important enough to grab your attention and focus. That gating mechanism is your thalamus. It's always working and automatically determining a hierarchy of senses so that you can focus on, and more accurately perceive the important ones. Ever noice how you can hear your name mentioned in a crowded room? Your thalamus has learned the specific auditory cues that make up your name, so that when those sounds hit your ears, they jump ahead of all other sounds heard at the same time and alert other processing parts of your brain.</p>
<p>Now the thalamus is wonderful, truly, life would be unlivable without it. But it doesn't solely hold the reins of your attention; you have direct control yourself. Take for a minute to sit and try and attend to other noises in the room. I bet if you have a fan or an AC unit, you can hear it running. It's been running this whole time, it hasn't gotten any louder now that you've decided to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Now to your ELI5: you were idly sitting in class and a person was walking down the hall. Their shoes were as squeaky as they ever were but you didn't notice. You, being a diligent student, were paying attention to the writing on the chalk board. Suddenly the chalk causes and unexpected squeak. This squeak sends an alert to your higher processing centers, pulling more of your attentional resources to that noise. Now because more of your attention is focused on that high pitch noise, you notice the squeaky sneaker in the hall.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains do not perceive sensory information in isolation. Nearly all sensory experience is multi-modal, where contextual cues from the other senses influence the perception of the primary sense-data (in this case hearing). </p>
<p>The multi-modality of sensation is dramatically demonstrated by the illusion called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">McGurk Effect</a>. For an amazing example, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/G-lN8vWm3m0" target="_blank">this short video</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have heard a theory that it sounds like a scream and is an echo of our past as mammals, but I think thats unlikely given the actual pain screams of animals isnt 'felt' to the same degree as the squeak/vibration of your examples.</p>
<p>In short, it's the way your inner ears vibrate and the synesthesia you get when that part of your brain is triggered making you feel awful. Its caused by overloading the senses with the various vibrations.
Its a complex tone with even vibration you cant 'hear' in it.</p>
<p>Sometimes people feel sick or actual pain.</p>
<p>It triggers some more than others due to brain and hearing differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm taking a psychoacoustics class right now and they describe it as three stages of sensory input: sensation, perception, and cognition. You'd think the brain would normally function respectively, but your cognition can influence your perception, and your perception can influence sensations as well. Your brain relies on a kind of amalgamation of sensory input and past experiences/memory. So your memory of a chalk board screech probably influenced your perception of an already somewhat similar sound.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, you can influence how your brain functions a bit. Musicians, for example, will have a much more &quot;memory&quot; based perception as they try and hear the chords and rhythm and relate to it. Over time, they demonstrably &quot;hear&quot; music differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
