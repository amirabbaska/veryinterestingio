<p>Heres a general rating system for the engines. <a href="http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/" target="_blank">http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/</a></p>
<p>At higher levels chess is largely considered a draw as there are many many ways to cause a draw, often in professional games like the world championship last year with Magnus Carlsen vs. Sergey Karjakin, Karjakin seemed to almost put Carlsen on tilt because he kept trading down pieces as if he was trying to cause a draw.</p>
<p>You have to keep in mind that in Chess draws are possible, so absolutely perfect doesn't mean much unless whenever it's solved it's proved that one side has the advantage in which case that color would always win.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given an actual AI, it would depend on the AI. Some might -play better as black than as white, or vice-versa, just like humans. But White has a first-move advantage, so it is likely that it would have an edge.</p>
<p>If the AI was perfect is a very different question - and it is a very well discussed issue - the answer is unclear; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_chess" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_chess</a></p>
<p>This is because there are 10^43 possible board positions, and you would need to list the best response for each one in order to solve the game fully. That's unlikely to be feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The discussion about white having an advantage in perfect play is conceptually wrong - it is true in games involving current heuristic and human game playing, but irrelevant. We cannot know which player can force a win, or if there is a forced draw, without solving chess. No, the fact that heuristic methods involving pruning trees are effective at winning doesn't change the issue with needing enumeration or clever proofs to show if there is a forced win or draw.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How about an AI for a different game? There have been waves made in AI research based on the game of Go.</p>
<p>For several years now, Google's been working on a Go AI, named AlphaGO. You may have heard of its match last year against top pro Lee Sedol, or its matches a few weeks ago versus World number 1 Ke Jie, if you follow either Go or AI research. (It went 4-1 vs Lee Sedol and then an easy 3-0 vs Ke Jie)</p>
<p>After the Ke Jie series, Google released 50 self-played games, AI versus AI. You can view the game records <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/alphago-vs-alphago-self-play-games/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>These games were played under full time controls, which I'm taking to mean 3 hours per side plus 3-5 extra one minute periods. It's highly unlikely that either side actually used all of that time, as it played a move around every 45 seconds during the Ke Jie matches.</p>
<p>An example of Blitz self-play can be found <a href="https://deepmind-media.storage.googleapis.com/alphago/pdf-files/english/ag-vs-ag1/AG%20vs%20AG%20-%20G1%20-%20English.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>There was a 7.5 point advantage to White in every game, called <em>komi.</em> Chinese Scoring rules.</p>
<p>In human play, White tends to have an advantage by virtue of the komi, but only barely. However, when AlphaGo played itself, White ended up winning 38 of the 50 games. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1U1p4Mwis60?t=17m20s" target="_blank">According to DeepMind</a>, AlphaGo thinks the game is very balanced at 7.5 komi, with a slight advantage to White. They have an interview at the start of every game, I think, if you're interested in more from them.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, when the komi was set to 6.5, Black started winning more games.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? If AlphaGo thinks the game is balanced at 7.5, yet has an overwhelmingly high win percentage as white?</p>
<p>Well, 50 games is not a large sample size, and these are curated games for us to study, rather than just randomly selected. It's entirely possible that the 70%+ winrate isn't entirely accurate.</p>
<p>However, it's also a possibility that, as the AI gets more and more perfect, the slight advantage given to White becomes more and more pronounced. I'm positive that this will be covered in DeepMind's next Nature paper. They released one after the Lee Sedol match, and plan on releasing another one. More of their work is <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a chess AI in python once. When I tried making it play itself, it would end up in the same situation every time - they would just get in a loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen moves up one square to put king in check</li>
<li>King moves down one square to escape</li>
<li>Queen moves down one square to put the king back in check</li>
<li>King moves up one square to escape</li>
</ul>
<p>This would repeat forever.</p>
<p>In the end, I changed it so that it had a 1/25 chance of making a 'mistake' (purposefully not making a good move), which meant that eventually one side would win.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
