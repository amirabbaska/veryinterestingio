		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the other way around. Human can survive on one of the most diverse diet. Most animal have a very specific diet and can't usually change it. If they lose that source of food, they can often be in danger. </p>
<p>Cats for exemple, lack the ability to produce certain aminos-acid and vitamins so they can't survive without meat to give them those things. Human can produce a lot of those so they mostly need a source of energy to produce what they need. They still need specific nutrient, but those are usually frequent and a lot of source of food can provide them.</p>
<p>People can survive on a LOT of different diet. But of course as we know more have the exact need of our body, you can specify our diet to make sure that we get all of what our body need, but that's not needed to be relatively healthy or to stay alive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really &quot;require&quot; a carefully balanced diet. Humanity as a species and would do fine if we all raised three kids and died from malnutrition around age 35. </p>
<p>The problem is, we don't really like that idea. And if you want to live till you're 80, you need to take proper care of your body. And thus people have figured out some pretty great and healthy diets. That's not required (just look at people who eat nothing but junkfood), but it will greatly improve the odds of growing old. </p>
<p>Think of it as maintaining a car. If you plan to scrap it after 50k miles, you can do whatever you want. But if you want to drive 350k on it, you need to change the oil, clean the filters, properly inflate the tires, use the right fuel etc. But you only have to do that if you want it to last a long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the advice for well-balanced diets is to extend your life. A human doesn't need to live for 60 or 80 or 100 years, but we want to. Evolution targets efficiency, and efficiency is &quot;live long enough to reproduce and then die as soon as you're not useful.&quot; Humans can live to 40 on terrible diets, which is fine if you reproduce at 20. Most people don't want that lifestyle, so we use knowledge of medicine and our bodies to extend our life further than evolution deems necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's funny, I just got out of TAing a course about human brain development where we were talking about what constraints act on the development of large brains at a species level. Related to your question about diet is the question of cooking -- specifically, when foods are cooked they can allow us to extract more usable calories from them. As an adult human, your brain requires about 25% of your caloric intake daily. The development of skills like cooking as well as biological specializations to process certain foods makes our large and complex brain (relative to our body size and food consumption) possible! Not sure if this exactly answers your question, but it's interesting at least! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals have all sorts of malnourishment problems. Humans just have enough food to be able to consider stuff like health and 'well-balanced diet'. Animals need that as well.</p>
<p>For example cats that don't hunt need extra calcium in their food because they never eat bones (NEVER give your cat cooked bones, only raw) and so on. Without a balanced diet they will die or get sick as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
