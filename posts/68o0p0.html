		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend brought home some off-brand cereal called &quot;Fruity Spins&quot; instead of the obvious &quot;Fruity Loops&quot; and they look the exact same and practically taste the same as well.
How does this &quot;Fruity Spins&quot; product not get absolutely destroyed in court?
Surely if I made a movie called &quot;Dahvengers&quot; and it had a nearly identical cast of characters as The Avengers then Marvel could sue me to the ground?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three basic protections to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Copyright = media, like books, movies, and such. Things that can be literally copied.</p>
<p>Trademarks = logos, characters, brand recognition</p>
<p>Patent = inventions, processes for doing things/making things.</p>
<p>You can't copyright or trademark food. You can patent a food, but only if it's pretty unique. Cereal isn't - most of it is all variations on a similar thing.</p>
<p>So there's nothing wrong with Fruit Spins looking or tasting like Froot Loops.</p>
<p>Brands and packaging can be protected. The font and logo of Froot Loops, for example, are probably trademarked. The bird-guy they use, too. So as long as Fruit Spins doesn't copy the font, logo, or bird-guy on their branding or boxes, they're not violating a trademark.</p>
<p>The Avengers, on the other hand, is likely copyrighted (for the actual content of the movies/comics) and trademarked (for the characters). </p>
<p>So if your Dahvengers movie had the same plot as an Avengers movie, just with different names or small details changed, you'd be violating copyright. If the characters were the same, or slightly changed (The Incredible Bulk, Titanium Dude, etc), you'd be violating trademark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The legal standard is whether the so-called &quot;knock-off&quot; brand is likely to cause confusion to the consumer or to cause them to mistake the knock-off brand to be sourced from the original. The law is more directed toward protecting the consumer and seems to permit copying a competitor's product.</p>
<p>&quot;[T]he plaintiff has the right not to lose his customers through false representations that those are his wares which in fact are not, but he may not monopolize any design or pattern, however trifling. The defendant, on the other hand, may copy plaintiff's goods slavishly down to the minutest detail: but he may not represent himself as the plaintiff in their sale</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, you can't patent recipes, etc.  But in many cases, some generic and store brand products are literally the same product.  The same factory produces both, just with different labels.</p>
<p>Sometimes even two brand name products are the same.  There are canneries in Samoa, for instance, that package tuna for both Sunkist and Chicken of the Sea.  It's like alternate days different labels.</p>
<p>edit: of course I meant starkist</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't copyright a recipe for food and usually can't patent a food product. The specific form in which a recipe is presented can be copyrighted (the words and formatting), but as long as someone changes up the words they can use the same ingredients, measurements, and steps. Similarly, you can protect branding and food packaging, but not a food product. If someone figures out how to make a Twinkie and sells it with different packaging and branding, they're allowed to.</p>
<p>Malt-O-Meal and others can get away with off-brand cereal because their packaging and branding is different. For example, they don't use Lucky the Leprechaun with their Marshmallow Mateys cereal (similar to Lucky Charms); they use a kangaroo instead. Also, I don't even think the recipe is exactly the same because their cereals definitely taste a little different.</p>
<p>In some cases you can patent  food products, but they have to be non-obvious and novel. Most food products are obvious variations on old recipes (like with cereal). Egg yolk substitutes are an example of a patented food product.</p>
<p>The big difference with movies is that you can copyright a script and characters but you can't normally patent a food. As a result, you can't recreate and sell a movie even if you have the ability to. You can still change a few things to avoid confusion with the original film and probably be okay, though. Or make a parody. The main thing is you can't cause confusion between your film and the original (i.e., you can't make it so that filmgoers would think your film is the original when at the box office buying tickets or that the original film approved or endorsed your film).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supermarket off-brands are frequently produced by the brand name companies. It's a win-win for the food company: either you buy their product at a markup or you buy their product for a little bit less. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
