		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all - I found this story shocking and disturbing when I first heard it and I certainly don't condone these actions....but they happened and were detailed in the video I saw.</p>
<p>I remember a documentary in the 90s where a guy would take a large tarp of plastic or cloth and stretch it out underneath a large tree in the Amazon rain forest.  They would then shoot some gas up into the air that would kill like 99% of all creatures it contacted....or maybe it was just insects, I can't remember but I think it only affected insects.</p>
<p>Anyways, for the next several hours the jungle would &quot;rain down&quot; the carcasses of dead insects onto the tarp and these scientists would collect the insects and categorize them.  </p>
<p>They said that every time they did this they would get something like 20,000 different insects but what was surprising to them was that <del>90%</del> (correction it's 80%) of what they found were &quot;new to science&quot; every time they did this experiment.</p>
<p>It didn't seem to matter where they went.....they repeated this many, many times and every time they did it, <del>90%</del> (correction it's 80%) of what they catalogued was new to science.</p>
<p>It literally blew the top off of the previously held estimates for the number of species on earth and at the end, the scientists had to conclude that they simply had no idea where it would end nor how many species of living things were on the earth anymore.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT - Found The Vid but not the clip I was referring to.  It's called &quot;Web of Life: Exploring Biodiversity&quot; and was produced by PBS back in the 90s.</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnsl5OpjwEY" target="_blank">Here's a clip...but not the one I referenced</a></p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdPDWGqjWh4&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank">The original clip I was talking about</a></strong><br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the way you calculate it is with a bit of estimation.</p>
<p>Say that we have a box with a hole, and the box has 1000 colored balls inside you can take out through the hole. What we don't know is which colors, or how many colors the balls are.</p>
<p>So we take out one ball, and it happens to be blue! So now we know there's blue balls in the box. Great!</p>
<p>Now imagine that there's only blue balls coming out. You pull out 10 balls and they are all blue, you keep pulling out 100 balls and they are all blue. Now we've only seen 10% of all balls inside the box, but we can start guessing that the chance that we never got another color means that most, if not all, balls are blue. Maybe we got lucky and only found the 100 blue balls first, but the chance of that happening are really small, theres 5958926632240478155489389057946132722598279588777288866613428027720091866834339557556406953783393337191792337384343797137527180562707601151082428455887739138152983603695993602780124665235348032787297990137398327480690965409929969664334240631387010833309096272433060469800960000000000000000000000000 different permutations (that is groups of balls we would pull out in an order) of balls we could have had, but only 1 of them would be if all of the balls were blue.</p>
<p>Now lets imagine what would happen if instead the second ball we pulled out was a red ball. This time we know there's more than just blue balls in the box. Now imagine that every time we pull a ball it comes out a different color, and after pulling out 100 they are all a different color each. Now there's a chance that there's 100 colors and nothing else, and we just happened to pull out one ball of each color with no repeats. The chance of this is a little bit higher than taking out all the balls of one color, but it still is very very very small. You'd have to be very lucky, it's a better guess to think there's still many colors we've yet to find. Maybe not 1000, but certainly more than 100.</p>
<p>So we can use the history of how many new colors we discovered as we saw each ball and create a good guess of how many colors probably exist in the box, and how many we know already.</p>
<p>The same thing can be done with organisms. We know more or less how many insects, fungi, plants, animals, bacteria etc. exist on earth by knowing how many resources they need, how much spaces is available, doing thermodynamic studies, etc. From there we notice that as we look at animals and see what species they are, we find new species every so much. Just like with the colors, we can guess how many species we probably haven't seen yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Statistics like this are created based on looking at what is identified within a group.</p>
<p>Perhaps an easier example.</p>
<p>Let's say people are inspecting defects in a product.  Someone in charge intentionally adds 10 defects.  Then they watch and see what comes through the line, what is discovered by the process.  If people only find 3 of the defects, then they can estimate they're catching 30% of the defects overall, letting 70% of the defects go through.  On the other hand, if all 10 defects are discovered, then they know they're catching all or nearly all of the defects.  The percentage of things they know about should roughly match the percentage of things they don't know about.</p>
<p>It applies to other statistics as well, like crime stats.  They can look at crimes they know happened but weren't reported through official channels, and look at crimes they know about and were reported. Looking at the difference shows about how many crimes go unreported.  It is not exact, but if people are careful about how they create the stats they can be fairly accurate. </p>
<p>For counting species there are several ways it can be done.  One way is like above, to have one group track the number of species in an area and another group figure out how many are new. Another method is a linear regression, figuring out an approximately how many species there should be based on estimates and comparing it to how many have actually been identified.</p>
<p>Also, most of the species that aren't discovered are small things.  We're down to small numbers of new birds and mammals, often they are sub-species that get reclassified as a new species, or they're highly specialized species living in a remote and small geographic area.  </p>
<p>It is mostly bugs, fungi, and other small organism that are being discovered in large numbers. These are things that are hard to spot and identify, many only identified because of genetic testing on tiny or microscopic organisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an exact answer but two that may help.</p>
<p>Many of the worlds species are insects, and many of those are thought to be beetles.</p>
<p>One bit of information that supports this theory comes from an attempt to document the number of species within a, relatively, small forest encampment. The researchers found that with each tree that was shaken to gather the insects on them, that there were many unique beetle species. Almost a new species per tree.</p>
<p>Aditionally, and unrelated to beetles, is that fact that we havent explored our oceans all that much. And that means that we've yet to find all the species that inhabit the oceans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well it's a bit outside my area of expertise, but if I had to make such an estimate, I would look at the rate at which we're discovering new species, and how that rate has changed over time. That would allow me to estimate how many species we're likely to find in the future. If the number is much larger than the number of species we already know, that would get your 14%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
