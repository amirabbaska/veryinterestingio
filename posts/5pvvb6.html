		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an open, public place, and it's something fairly non-committal. If you sit down for a full meal, you're there for probably the better part of an hour. If you grab a coffee, you can chat for as long or short as you like depending on what's going on. It's also pretty cheap, only spending a few bucks for a drink rather than maybe $20 or more for a full meal. Timing is also more flexible. You can grab a drink whenever, but going for a meal at something like 3:00 in the afternoon is a bit odd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a common practice that is done in a public non threatening location. Nearly everyone drinks coffee, tea, cocktails, and or other beverages, otherwise they... you know... die. Also, this doesn't require a lot of time or cost by either party so there is a low risk/reward threshold.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what could be more cost effective... maybe meeting for gum on a street corner?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these answers are totally spot on but, also, caffeine and alcohol make you want to talk. Caffeine is a stimulant so you naturally want to converse more while alcohol decreases your inhibitions and removes many social anxieties because of it. You naturally want to talk more, are more engaging and can leave if it gets weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition, it is not romantic, so less chance of someone mistaking it for a date. You are going to a bustling, well-lit public place for a fairly short period of time. You are drinking something to make you more alert, as opposed to alcohol which will make you less alert. I can ask a male colleague to discuss a project with me while we get coffee, but if I said &quot;Let's discuss it over lunch,&quot; &quot;Let's get a beer and talk it over,&quot; that could have very different implications. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sharing a drink of some sort has been a social ritual of long standing. In ancient times, the sharing of tea was a time when differences were put aside for a few moments and people were able to get along, even if they were enemies. It was also a ritualistic way for a host to demonstrate to the guest the honor that the host felt in having the guest in their presence. These rituals were slow and took much time. In more modern environs, coffee has been added to the mix of beverages; as well as a shot of good bourbon in some boardrooms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
