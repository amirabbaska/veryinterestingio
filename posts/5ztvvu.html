		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note: Some of the content below might sound gross to some, but this is/was the way of life for a huge chunk of people that you might never come across. Also, please don't judge them if they are so poor that they can't even afford a proper toilet. </p>
<p>I am from India and it is true that we (the general population, not the elite or upper middle-class) use our left hand to wash off the bum with water after nature takes its course. It is one of the first things that we are taught when we are around 3 years old (till then its your mom/dad/elders, because Indian style squatting toilets are not safe for kids and need supervision). We are taught to wash our hands with soap immediately afterwards. It is so ingrained in your psyche that transition from that habit to Western habit of using a toilet paper was so painful because I would never &quot;feel&quot; clean after using toilet paper. Also, I come from a lower-middle class background in India, and when I was a small kid and we used to go to our grandparents house in rural south-India, they didn't have a proper toilet. They had dug a pit in the estate behind their cottage and adults used that to take a dump. Kids would just go into the woods and take a dump where no one is seeing them and clean up afterwards. You always take water with you to clean up afterwards. </p>
<p>Back when the caste-system was still very prevalent in India, people from a certain caste were responsible for cleaning up other people's shit from common area (dump sites like woods). It is still true in many rural locations in India, but education and general social progression is slowly changing it. Current Prime Minister, Mr. Modi, even started a campaign called Swachh Bharat (or Clean India) under which a chunk of the budget was allocated to build toilets in rural India and generate awareness in those area.</p>
<p>As a side-note, as the living standards are rising, people are moving towards toilet paper in India too and having a western-style lavatory in your house is considered a must have and a &quot;status-symbol&quot; (because we love to copy western culture as a mark to show better life-style). It is important to note that squatting is the most natural style of taking a dump, rather than sitting on the toilet seat. It is more healthy and less strenuous on the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ancient Greeks used stones/clay. The Romans used a community sponge on a stick (they kept it in salty water in a bucket at their bath house). In colonial America the old farmers almanac had a hole through the corner so it could hang in the outhouse (people could rip out sheets to use). Toilet paper began commercial production in 1857, but evidently they caused splinters until Quilted Northern invented &quot;splinter free&quot; in 1935. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many places in the world still use the barrel and bucket. Wipe your bum with your left hand (two sides to each finger, finish with the thumb). Clean your left hand by running water over it. In places where water is scarce, you have to reuse the water. Try not to touch anything with your sinister hand.</p>
