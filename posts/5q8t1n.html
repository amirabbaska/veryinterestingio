		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answer about cost effective solutions to meet the current needs, where both the needs and costs change over time, but your point about discovering new techniques should be addressed. </p>
<p>New, better, coding techniques (for errors correction and recovery) allow you to send more bits in a given symbol. Essentially, if you and I are talking and we want to communicate the most complete sentences with the fewest words, we can agree on a code book.  Something like: heyu = how are you?, hiya = I am fine,  etc.  but in binary.   If I just send those four letters, but you only get h_y_ you cannot decode my message.  I can add extra letters to the message (redundancy) with some type of agreed coding so if you lose some of the letters you might be able to figure out which were missing, up to some point.  </p>
<p>In communication systems, this can extend to 256 bits or more in a single symbol (sent as a single transmission waveform), and with coding techniques available I will chose how to encode my data and what kind if symbols to use based on how likely it is that there will be errors (how much noise there is on the channel).  At the same time that processing power has gotten better and cheaper, so we can process long messages to decode them quickly, and we have moved from hardware processing to software, people have also discovered new codes which can give me as much or more ability to decode the original message with better chances of success.  In some cases the math was simple (turbo codes), it just took someone having an Aha! moment, in others (LDPC) the math gets pretty out there.  Also,  new codes are great on paper, but not always possible to process in the time required for real two way real-time communication. </p>
<p>Beyond an ELI5 post as well, new antenna designs, multiple input multiple output antenna arrays and cross antenna interference cancellation techniques, as well as new more efficient  multiple access strategies, have been developed that would not have been reasonable, or in some cases possible, with older systems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wireless N draft was 2007, released 2009. Since then, we haven't had any strictly better standards for 2.4 GHz. ac is an improvement over short distances, but not over longer distances. It is not strictly better.</p>
<p>ac wireless has several advantages:</p>
<p>1) Does not use 2.4 GHz. 2.4GHz spectrum is massively congested now, since wifi is everywhere. 5 GHz has more room, and less things on it. This is an advantage which in 2007 really wasn't all that big, because there were less wifi devices everywhere (the iphone only came out in 2007, no smart watches, etc.). Also, less interference from things like microwave ovens.</p>
<p>2) Higher frequency = more speed. ac starts at 450 Mbits per second. Not really much call for that in 2007.</p>
<p>3) Beamforming / MIMO. This uses processing power to increase the throughput by focusing the signal. Wireless n was already a significantly higher throughput than most people needed, and if you needed really high throughput you'd use ethernet.</p>
<p>4) Extended battery life. This advantage has improved over time, as the power drain of other items such as CPU has gone down, laptops have gotten thinner, and batteries smaller as a consequence.</p>
<p>However, there are downsides:</p>
<p>a) More processing power. Which means more expensive, a cost which goes down over time as chips get faster.</p>
<p>b) Using 5 GHz means you need antennae for two frequencies, since otherwise you would not be able to use 2.4 GHz networks. More cost.</p>
<p>c) Less range on the 5 GHz. With a higher frequencies, it does not go as far, and is stopped by walls, etc. more easily.</p>
<p>d) You need to upgrade everything to ac to get the benefits.</p>
<p>So, I'm seeing quite a few disadvantages, for advantages which are mostly increased throughput which no one needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, processing powers increase whilst decreasing cost and energy requirements. But that is not all. </p>
<p>As you concluded yourself, new algorithms, compression method and other transmission methods help with this too. New algorithms, or more accurate ones, can help with developing better filters, antennas or can help with faster compression, error correction etc. </p>
<p>All those factors help with creating new technology which leads to faster wireless communication standards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the technical points, the standard has to be agreed on among manufacturers. This is a negotiation process that involves giving and taking. </p>
<p>More advanced manufacturers want new standards to include higher specifications that are easier for them to meet than their competitors, but if they push too hard then there won't be enough low cost hardware to ensure adoption. </p>
<p>Apple has been both helped and harmed by this strategy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
