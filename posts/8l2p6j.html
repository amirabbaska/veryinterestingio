		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well we can imply what they eat by looking at their anatomy and comparing it to living animals or by using common sense when looking at their anatomy. For example the dinosaur Spinosaurus has a long and narrow jaw with pointy conical shaped teeth. This is very similar to modern fish eating animals like some crocodilians. This shape minimizes the resistance in water when closing quickly and the pointy teeth are prefect for snagging fish. All of this information along with the new data coming from the specimen recently discovered in Morocco which shows Spinosaurus most likely where at least semi-aquatic. All of this points to a fish based diet for this genus. Of course new evidence, or a new way of looking at current evidence, can change how we view Spinosaurus so nothing is certain in any science especially paleontology. Sometimes it's easier to find out especially when some dinosaurs like Coelophysis have been discovered with actual stomach contents preserved. In Coelophysis' case the contents where little lizard bones. For plant eating dinosaurs we look at the teeth and the known plant fossils of the area and can make educated guesses to what they where eating. Some of the large long necked dinosaurs, known as Sauropods, had very long necks that where held vertically off the ground. Brachiosaurus is an example of this and it's obvious that they where eating from the tops off tall trees.</p>
<p>I really hope this all makes a little sense. We will never know for certain what they ate though some are easier to have a basic understanding of their diet than others. This is a really great question by the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question.</p>
<p>We don’t usually know exactly what prehistoric animals ate, but there are lots of lines of evidence that give us good ideas, and in some cases very specific answers.</p>
<p>Here's a bunch:</p>
<p><strong>Teeth</strong> The number one way paleontologists explore dino-diets is by looking at their teeth. All across the animal kingdom, teeth are shaped for diet, so we can compare ancient dentition with the animals we know today. The sharp and serrated teeth of many theropod dinosaurs were built for slicing meat; <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tyrannosaur-teeth-were-serrated-like-steak-knives-1.3172520" target="_blank">tyrannosaur teeth</a> were particularly thick and strong, probably very good at crunching bone; the peg-like teeth of some <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/saurischia/sauropoddiet.html" target="_blank">sauropods</a> are thought to have been useful for raking soft leaves; and the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleocomm/2016/09/14/all-the-better-to-chew-you-with-my-dear/" target="_blank">complex tooth-batteries of hadrosaurs</a> were extremely efficient for grinding up plants. And more!</p>
<p><strong>Micro-wear</strong> By taking a microscopic look at teeth, paleontologists can examine the patterns of tiny scratches and damage the teeth accrued during eating. This can help distinguish, for example, who was eating <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44172-dinosaur-teeth-microwear-analysis" target="_blank">soft foods vs. hard foods</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth chemistry</strong> Different foods have different chemical make-up, and animals pick up those chemical signals when they eat them. So paleontologists can compare the ratios of isotopes (different forms) of elements like Oxygen and Carbon in dinosaur teeth to figure out, say, <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1666/08020.1" target="_blank">what kinds of plants</a> they were eating.</p>
<p><strong>Poop!</strong> <a href="https://commondescentpodcast.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/episode-30-prehistoric-poop/" target="_blank">Coprolites</a> are fossilized feces, and if you can link a poop to a pooper, you can see exactly what it ate. Bone fragments have been found in coprolites attributed to large meat-eaters, plant remains are often found in the turds of plant-eaters, and sometimes we find surprises, such as a recent study that revealed that some hadrosaurs were (accidentally?) eating <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/news/dinosaur-poop-shows-presumed-vegetarians-also-ate-meat" target="_blank">crustaceans</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Fossilized gut contents</strong> It is true that internal organs almost never fossilize, but sometimes we get lucky. If an animal dies before it finishes digesting its last meal, the food can fossilize along with the rest of the body. We’ve found dino-stomachs with fossilized <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26893497/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/plant-eating-dinosaur-spills-his-guts/#.WwMn64gvw2w" target="_blank">plant</a> and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/22809-diinosaur-gut-contents.html" target="_blank">animal</a> remains.</p>
<p><strong>Bite marks</strong> Sometimes we’ll find a dinosaur bone with <a href="http://markwitton-com.blogspot.com/2014/09/does-deinonychus-really-have-one-of.html" target="_blank">suspicious holes</a> that match up perfectly with the shape of the teeth of local predatory dinosaurs. In really lucky cases, the predator’s teeth will end up <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/tyrannosaurus-rex-hunted-for-live-prey-1.13381" target="_blank">stuck inside the bones</a> of its prey, a wonderful &quot;smoking gun&quot; pointing to the perpetrator.</p>
<p>And I'm almost certainly forgetting others.</p>
<p>AND the best part is that all these different lines of evidence generally agree with each other - we don’t tend to find plant remains in the guts of dinosaurs with sharp meat-slicing teeth, for example. So while we almost never know <em>exactly</em> what a dinosaur ate (and even when we do, we only get a small sample of its diet), using all these different strategies we can cobble together a very good idea for most prehistoric animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can also sort of tell from the amount of Carbon or Nitrogen isotopes left in the fossils (assuming any are left) from the food it ate. From that you can tell if it mostly ate plants, or land or marine animals, or other foods like algea, etc. I don't know the typical concentration for plants or animals but it is different. There is always a slight amount of unstable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the air. This is taken in by plants and consumed by plant eaters and then meat eaters eat them. The isotopes slowly decay, and the amounts of remaining isotope can determine both the age of the fossil as well as concentration from the food source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
