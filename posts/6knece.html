		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Receptacles deliver power to plugs via spring clips. Everytime you plug something in or take it out, the springs take some wear and tear.  They wear out over time and are rated for x amount of timed you can plug/unplug . </p>
<p>Cheaper receptacles are rated for less times while more expensive receptacles are made better/have better materials and are typically rated for a higher amount.  </p>
<p>*edit hospital grade receptacles have a much high spring tension
Or You might also be used tamper resistant receptacles and people have issues with the plastic guards retracting if the plug is not inserted properly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These outlets seem like you really need to jam the plug in to get something into them, and you'll probably only find them in newer homes or recently renovated rooms. They're basically designed to close a door over each prong socket and neither will open unless you stick something into both sides at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I mean, there's like birds and bees, see?<br />
No, hold on.  Let's say you've got a ground and a hot wire.<br />
Oh I give up, it's oxidation and that just gets in the way.  Plus, sometimes things aren't made up to &quot;snuff&quot;, cuz they're cheap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some kinds of electrical faults cause an arc of high-voltage electricity to zap between the plug blade and the metal tabs in the socket. This turns some of the metal into an oxide, a different chemical that's bulkier and more 'crusty' than the metal itself. </p>
<p>As the oxide builds up, it can make the socket's metal tabs slightly thicker, which makes it hard to insert a plug. </p>
<p>It's a good idea to replace plugs and sockets that have oxidized significantly, because the 'crust' increases the odds that more electrical faults will occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
