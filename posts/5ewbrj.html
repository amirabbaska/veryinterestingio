		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism of action isn't well understood, but as someone who's done literally a couple hundred hits of LSD lifetime, on high dose experiences you begin to forget who you are and lose a sense of individuality and feel like you're just melting into the universe. There is no longer a &quot;you&quot;, there is only everything. We are all a part of the universe, just groups of atoms and molecules spit out randomly and perfectly in just a way that we are able to identify ourselves and observe our universe. </p>
<p>At lower doses there isn't this &quot;ego death&quot; as much as you realize that anger is a choice and we are just another animal existing in a spec of dust in a universe grander than we could ever imagine </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because the duality between &quot;you&quot;  vs. &quot; the outside world&quot;  is merely a psychological construct. Taking psychedelics breaks this construct down, which puts you in a state of egolessness. This state is characterised by feeling one with everything.</p>
<p>The whole idea of &quot;the self&quot; as a singular, finite and bounded entity is flat-out wrong. &quot;The self&quot;  is an evolutionary mechanism, a model of you as biological machine, one that enhances your survivability. Since it is only a model, it is an imperfect representation of reality. While it is at the core of our being and perceiving the world, it is essentially, an illusion. </p>
<p>In reality, there is no duality: everything is interconnected and there is no boundary where &quot;you&quot; stop and the external world begins. Psychedelics can be a reminder of this.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know. As someone mentioned its a schedule 1 drug so no studying can be done on specific brain pathways. </p>
<p>We do know:
LSD-25 activates 5HT (serotonin) receptors directly on the target cell.
the overall response to this activation is dependent on what part of the brain you are activating or where the receptors are located, LSD activates receptors on raphe neurons that project all over the brain but in higher concentrations in the thalamus (known as our perception modulator, it filters incoming stimuli and passes it along) LSD binds to receptors, activates them and makes the thalamus freak out.
This is the mechanism of perceptual alterations and may be
responsible for interconnected experiences. </p>
<p>LSD is a psychedelic, if you are looking for experiences of unity, dissociative hallucinogens (PCP, Ketamine) will give you a stronger effect.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
