How did the air get there in the first place?  Is it just really, really old?  Will the oxygen ever get replenished or is it mostly unusable now?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rock around those caves is mostly sandstone and limestone, both of which are permeable (notice all the stalagmites and stalactites in the images).   To find air, all you would have to do is find a part of the cave above the water table, as the air would be able to seep through the rocks.  As to how often the the oxygen gets replenished, I found <a href="https://caves.org/pub/journal/PDF/V79/cave-79-01-59.pdf" target="_blank">this article</a> that says that the air tends to get swapped out of caves on Mallorca whenever the outside air temperature gets lower than the cave temperature.  It also mentions that the water table level is connected to the tides there.  So presumably as the tides rise and fall, there would be at least somewhat of a bellows effect, getting some new air, even if not from all the way from the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is, they don’t. But the problem is with the question. If the entire cave is underwater, and deep, for example, 100 feet below the water surface, no breathable air pockets will exist. In some tourist caves like this, there may be temporary pockets of exhaled gas formed by passing divers, but this will disappear rapidly due to low dissolved gasses in this type of cave water. However, in a deep cave that is mostly dry, but has areas that are inundated with water (called sumps, or siphons), the possibility of air pockets is directly related to water table, or “perched aquifers” as answered above.  In the case of the Thai cave, the entire cave area they were diving is periodically mostly dry. Due to the shape of the passage, water flow will force water through the passage, and then recede, creating localized pooling, which if deep enough, could be considered as having air pockets above, or pools below, depending on your point of view. Limestone is normally not very porous, but caves are formed along fracture weaknesses in the strata, so air and water can usually pass through areas like this, allowing air back in, as water levels drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
