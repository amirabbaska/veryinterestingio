What determines the maximum temperature, and what item do we think could get the absolute hottest due only to a microwave oven?  </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the responses! Very informative.</p></div></div>

<p>Grapes are mildly electrically conductive and their size is close to the wavelength of the microwave. Induced current moving back and forth over the narrow connection between the halves of the split grape drives it to enormous temperatures. Plasma is also conductive so the oven continues to drive fucktons of current through it keeping it twisting around in there at several thousand degrees.</p>
<p>Caution, vaporized organic matter has a unique smell and may cause your microwave oven to melt or make the glass parts shatter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My understanding is that the temperature you can achieve can go higher still, but practical matters make higher temperatures increasingly difficult, such as sufficiently insulating the molten material you are heating so that the heat doesn't leak away faster than you can add energy, and doing it without heat-damaging the oven, etc. People line the oven interior with brick like a kiln.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. As something gets hotter, the rate heat is conducted and radiated away increases. However, your microwave doesn't increase its power output as the food inside it gets hotter. So, if you put something in a 600 watt microwave (made up that number) and turn the microwave on for forever, eventually whatever is inside the microwave will heat up until it is conducting and radiating away 600 watts of heat. At that point it is in equilibrium and the temperature will not increase or decrease. This maximum temperature depends on how much contact it has with the air and microwave (since I will conduct heat to them) and it's surface area (more surface area means more area for heat to radiate away from). So, if you wanted to get something incredibly hot, you should get something very small and use magnets to suspend it in midair, then create a vacuum inside the microwave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave energy strongly interacts with water because it is a polar molecule. Therefore, foods containing lots of water will heat up more strongly than those which lack a great deal of water.</p>
<p>Simple experiment:</p>
<p>Place a slice of bread into the microwave for one minute. It should heat a little bit, perhaps 5-10 degrees C.</p>
<p>Then if you put 0.3 L of water into the microwave, you heat it from room temperature to close to boiling, an increase of 50-70C, in one minute.</p>
<p>Because of the impact of water, it is hard to get anything in the microwave above 100C.</p>
<p>A few foods do contain enough polar molecules which have differing thermal properties than water, and can be heated above 100C. I believe certain cooking oils, including coconut oil, are among them. I don't recommend trying it, as I can't find any reference for how hot it can get!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
