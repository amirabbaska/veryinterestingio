		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it is because adult chicken pox tends to cause complications like pneumonia and encephalitis while childhood chicken pox does not. Adults’ immune systems are stronger and employ more antibodies (rather than white blood cells) than children’s immune systems do, which is what triggers the immune response and the subsequent symptoms.
Some strains of the flu are like this, too, such as the 1918 pandemic. The Spanish Flu killed young adults instead of the usual flu victims (old people and kids) because that strain triggered a severe immune reaction called a cytokine storm which basically shut down the bodies of infected people. A stronger immune system=stronger immune reaction=worse symptoms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a lot of infections, the it’s not the disease agent that does the most damage to the body, it’s your overzealous immune system. Some parts of your immune system aren’t developed yet when you are a child so the immune response is less coordinated and more inefficient in a way. In some infections this is bad because the infection will get worse, but in some cases like chickenpox it’s a good thing. This because the child’s immune system is still able to fight off the infection in its less coordinated state that is unable to go into the hyper-efficient scorched earth mode that causes chicken pox to be fatal to adults. Hope this was helpful!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

While it tries too hard it causes problems like swelling in lymph nodes and extra fluid in the lungs, which can easily turn into other nasty diseases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
