		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably a lost cause given the number of upvotes the top comment has received, but I feel the need to point out that while <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2salhs/is_it_possible_that_a_mountain_taller_than_the/cnnr3cs" target="_blank">it</a> is correct in the sense that Everest probably represents about the highest mountain we'd get on Earth, the explanation provided along with that is a gross (and largely wrong) over simplification. There are many physical limits on the height of mountain ranges, which include:</p>
<p><strong>Work Required to Continue Building Topography</strong> This is probably the one that gets closest to what is being described in that top comment (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2salhs/is_it_possible_that_a_mountain_taller_than_the/cnnr3cs" target="_blank">&quot;whereby they cause the earth's crust to compress from sheer mass&quot;</a>), but has less to do with isostasy and more to do with work (in the energy sense) involved in building topography. For mountain ranges like the Himalaya that are built through the collision of continents, this collision represents the energy input. At a certain point, the amount of work required to continuing to increase elevations exceeds the input and it is &quot;easier&quot; to simply expand the mountain range laterally. For those interested in a technical treatment of this, check out <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/faculty/molnarpdf/1988GSASpecPaper.M&amp;LyonCaen.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Isostasy</strong> Isostasy is an important factor, but within that, the really important point is the nature of the lithosphere that the mountain range is sitting on. While thinking of topography on the Earth from a purely isostatic standpoint (i.e. blocks floating in water) works to some extent, the better description is in terms of flexure (i.e. blocks sitting on a taut sheet of elastic). The height of a mountain range (the height of your block measured relative to some reference) will depend on the density and size of the block and the strength, essentially the thickness of the elastic sheet. You could imagine the same exact block having very different heights depending on whether the sheet is very thin (sinks down a lot, block is not very high) or very thick (doesn't sink much, block is much higher). In terms of mountain ranges, this basically depends on the type of material in the mountain range, the shape of that mountain range, and the nature of the lithosphere it forms on. This is largely why Olympus Mons on Mars is as high as it is, not the gravity, but rather because the thickness and the rigidity of the Martian lithosphere is much much greater than Earth's and thus can support larger loads. Coupled with the lack of active tectonics and a fixed source for magma from a hotspot leads to a giant volcano.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure-Temperature Conditions at the Base of a Mountain Range</strong> Probably one of the most important aspects for collisional mountain belts, like the Himalaya are the fact that they have reached the height they are by crustal thickening, basically the crust being deformed and stacked on top of itself. Because of the isostatic/flexural response, as the crust thickens, elevations increase but the depths (and thus the pressures and temperatures) that the bottom, or root, of your mountain range is experiencing also increase. At a certain point, the temperature and pressure conditions reach a point where the material making up the mountain range will change into a very dense rock called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclogite" target="_blank">eclogite</a>. The eclogite will be denser than the mantle rocks against which it is juxtaposed, which is gravitationally unstable, leading to a process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_%28geology%29" target="_blank">delamination</a>, where this dense elcogitic root detaches and sinks into the mantle. Going back to the isostasy discussion, there is now a reduced thickness of crust which on the long term will lead to a reduction in elevations of the range.</p>
<p><strong>Climate</strong> Another huge factor is the effect of climate and erosional processes on the height of mountain ranges. There is a relatively popular idea referred to as the &quot;glacial buzzsaw&quot; which predicts (and has been largely born out by data in many of the Earth's active mountain ranges) that mountain ranges generally will not exceed a certain height because of the actions of glaciers, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLfM1FB58yA" target="_blank">video that describes the &quot;buzzsaw&quot; in a simple way</a>. Glaciers are incredibly efficient erosional agents, so once a mountain range reaches heights sufficient to start forming glaciers, the glaciers in turn buzz down the peaks of that range. The height limit imposed by glaciers would obviously depend on latitude (higher latitudes can support glaciers at lower elevations), general climate, and the precipitation patterns in the mountain range (still need precipitation to form glaciers). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tallest mountain of all time is probably around the height of Mount Everest because mountains hit something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy" target="_blank">isostatic limit</a> whereby they cause the earth's crust to compress from sheer mass. Olympus Mons is another mountain that reaches the isostatic limit, but is significantly higher because of Mars' reduced gravity and less active plate tectonics. The field of paleoaltimetry deals with this and similar questions.</p>
<p>EDIT: Damn, this blew up. Lots of questions here I don't know the answer to. I'm not a geologist, just a nerd who remembered a tidbit from an undergrad geology class I took 8 years ago, then confirmed it with Google. =/</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual maximum theoretical height of a mountain ON LAND on Earth is around 10km, which is right about where Mauna Kea is today, and roughly twice what we see with Everest. Contrary to some of the other answers, it's entirely possible for a mountain to exist at those heights...albeit temporarily. Someone even did the math: <a href="http://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/how-high-can-mountains-be/" target="_blank">http://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/how-high-can-mountains-be/</a></p>
<p>Basing his calculations on the mountains load on the crust underneath, and the failure point of granite, he worked out that the maximum height for a granite mountain on Earth is roughly 10km. Beyond 10km, the granite would simply crumble under its own weight and collapse. </p>
<p><em>h</em><code>max</code> ≈ 2×10^8 N/m^2 /(3×10^3 kg/m^3 ˙ 10 m/s^2 )≈ 10^4 m = 10 km</p>
<p>While that's the maximum theoretical height, everyone else is correct when talking about practical maximum height. The isostatic limit would normally prevent mountains from ever approaching this height through the processes which normally raise our peaks, and erosion typically kicks in to help keep mountains from achieving that maximum potential.</p>
<p>However, this does <em>not</em> mean that mountains could not have achieved these heights for brief periods. Massive volcanic events such as the one that created the Siberian and Deccan Traps, or the Ontong-Java Plateau in the South Pacific, could have created mountains that reached this limit. Given a large enough vent, more conventional volcanoes might be able to reach heights well above Everest (though the calculations would need to be redone to account for their weaker source material.) Massive asteroid impacts could have also created peaks that approached this limit. Certain types of earthquakes could theoretically generate mountains of that size almost overnight. The Giant Impact Hypothesis, which supposes that the moon was generated from debris originating in Earths impact with another object, would have almost certainly generated mountains of this size.</p>
<p>All would have been very short lived as the crust sank beneath them and erosion tore them apart, but it's certainly POSSIBLE that mountains significantly taller than Everest have briefly existed  on the Earth's surface. Given the planets long and violent history, I think it's probable that Everest has been eclipsed at least once. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li><em>&quot;When discussing mountains, there is a huge difference in definition between ‘tallest’ and ‘highest’. Mount Everest is the highest, but the tallest mountain on earth is actually in Mauna Kea in Hawaii.</em></li>

<p>And in reference to your question, I'm sure it's likely that there were taller mountains at some point, but I doubt it's possible to tell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mountains taller than Everest exist now.  Mauna Kea is 1400 meters taller than Everest.   Everest’s claim to be the world’s tallest mountain is based on the fact that its summit is the highest point above sea level on the earth’s surface. All Everest’s 8,848 metres of mountain are above sea level. From base to summit Mauna Kea measures 10,200 metres, but the first 5,995 of those meters are below the surface of the ocean. If the title of tallest mountain was measured from base to peak, Mount Everest would actually be third, behind Mauna Kea and Mount McKinley in Alaska.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
