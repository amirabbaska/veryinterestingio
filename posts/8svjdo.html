		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, to be more precise, there is a property of water and ice that will tell you how much the water will expand. It's called <em>density</em> and it's defined as the mass of the material per unit of volume. So a unit of density is the gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm^3 ). Water has a density of 1 g/cm^3 and ice has a density of about 0.93 g/cm^3 , i.e. a cubic centimetre of water contains 1 gram but a cubic centimetre of ice (the same volume) weighs less at 0.93 grams.</p>
<p>Now since the total mass does not change when water freezes, but the density decreases (since ice is less dense) you can work out how the volume will change.
Say you have one litre (1000 cm^3 ) of water - this weighs 1000 g (1 kg). If you freeze it, it still weighs a kilogram but now has a lower density. Since density = mass/volume, rearranging the formula gives you volume = mass/density. The new volume is therefore (1000 g)/(0.93 g/cm^3 ) = 1075.3 cm^3 , or 1.0753 litres. So you can indeed work out the expansion.</p>
<p>Note: the densities of water and ice vary slightly with temperature, but this can be ignored for most applications.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While density can be used to determine the volume change in a material, that's kind of the back door approach. There are entire tables of a material property called an expansion coefficient. It's a typically linear value that can be used in a formula to determine the volume of an object at any given temperature. It's used in a lot of construction, even if it's not what they call it. Ever wonder why they put cracks in concrete? Expansion. It heat and expands, and the larger the slab, the more stress you put into it. Brick can expand up to 1 inch for every 60 feet. Like any material, wood expands and contracts, which is why you hear your house creak as the temps cool from the day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The change of volume of a given quantity of water is functionally dependent on both temperature and pressure.  You can fit the empirical data points from a given substance to an equation, but I'm not aware of any way you could calculate the density of a substance at some arbitrary pressure or temperature without interpolating between observed values and incurring some error.</p>
<p>TL;DR  There's no universal law you can use to produce the equation so you have to do the experiment at a given temperature and pressure or find someone else who has.  Because it's water, I bet someone has already.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated there's a known volume for a specific temperature and pressure, but there isn't really a set formula for this if you want to know what the values are you need to look in a table. There are formulas that exist which are just equations set to best fit a certain set of data but there is no standard formula like PV=nRT for an ideal gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
