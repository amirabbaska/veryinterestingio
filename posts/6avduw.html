Obviously precipitation is out, but are there any sort of weather events? Strange eddies or localized currents where warmer and colder waters meet, the equivalent of a a windy stormy day under water? Are there ever the equivalent of dust storms along the ocean floor? Anything that could reasonably be called weather? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly some similarities to the way that weather works. The ocean's Gulf Stream can <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zVcdviq.gif" target="_blank">buckle and spawn warm/cold core rings</a>, incredibly similar to the way our atmosphere's jet stream can <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ewu6gC2.jpg" target="_blank">buckle and spawn local highs and local lows</a>.</p>
<p>That said, a local low vortex spawns storms in our atmosphere. While oceanic rings are also vortices, there's no real equivalent of storms since there's no precipitation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the interesting portions of the weather are related to the phase changes of water which gives precipitation and stuff. Apart from that, in the ocean there are still eddies and currents. </p>
<p>However, while the atmosphere is heated from below (sunlight at the surface), which drives convection and stuff, the ocean is heated from above. This mostly means that its only the upper layers of the ocean that have what could be called weather, ie variations on short time scales. </p>
<p>Its perfectly possible to find eddies by using satellites to measure variations in sea surface height or temperature. The larger the eddy the longer it will last for. Its the mesoscale (10-500 km) eddies that last for days to months. The larger the eddy the larger the effect, so its harder to see the effect of the smaller eddies (just like in the atmosphere).</p>
<p>There are eddies everywhere and they could be thought of as ocean weather but they aren't particularly exciting like a supercell storm or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers have explained how 'weather' is not an applicable term to the oceans below the surface layers (which do in fact have a large influence on weather). I just wanted to make explicit that this is because the process in the troposphere occur largely due to energy input from the sun, the light from which cannot penetrate more than a few hundred metres in the ocean. Differences in received solar energy across the Earth create the heat differentials necessary for winds, the evaporation necessary for H₂O's phase changes, the energy that is re-radiated by greenhouse gases, and the photochemical reactions necessary to create an ozone layer. </p>
<p>Disregarding the term weather, your question drives at what sort of variability in conditions exist in the oceans. Surface currents driven by wind, patches of upwelling due to interactions between currents and seafloor topography, and largescale <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_gyre" target="_blank">ocean gyres</a> are all interesting aspects illustrating our dynamic oceans. </p>
<p>Moving to the deep oceans, less and less variability in ambient conditions is typically seen, which is one reason why deep-sea sediments make auch good indicators of climates and environments that existed long before any formal records or humans at all. Perhaps the major phenomenon of interest down there are deep sea currents, or the cold components of the <a href="http://https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">global thermohaline circulation</a>, which as its name suggests is driven by density differences caused by variations in temperature and salinity. </p>
<p>One of my favourite quotes from marine biologist Rachel Carson on the deep sea borrows a term from atmospheric weather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I think of the floor of the deep sea, the single, overwhelming fact that possesses my imagination is the accumulation of sediments. I see always the steady, unremitting, downward drift of materials from above, flake upon flake, layer upon layer – a drift that has continued for hundreds of millions of years, that will go on as long as there are seas and continents..... For the sediments are the materials of most stupendous snowfall the Earth has ever seen...” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Marine snow' sounds so much better than the sediment and feacal detritus that it actually is. Conveys they constant nature of the process quite nicely though. </p>
<p>So what we have in terms of 'ocean weather' is a large conveyor belt of density driven currents and some wind driven ones on top with various smaller scale process of circulation and fragmentation in between. The driving physics for both ocean and atmospheric movement is fluid mechanics, which is essentially the same, but operates much more slowly in the oceans due to the higher density, and is not accompanied by phase changes which lead to all the interesting things seen in weather like precipitation and hurricanes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that surprised me when I first learned fluid dynamics is that the oceans have largely the same equations of motion as the air, since they're both fluids! (Oceans have an extra salinity equation, while the atmosphere has an extra water vapour equation) One difference however is that the ocean is pretty much truly incompressible. Another thing is that density currents are more prominent in oceans due to the effect of salinity.</p>
<p>Other than that, most of the theory holds. There are things like eddies (Kolmogorov thy.), fronts, inertial oscillations etc. Since water is &gt;800x more dense than air, different terms in the equations will be more significant for each of the two systems. Finally, it is worth noting that the atmosphere and ocean are coupled -- the oceans affect the weather (eg. el nino), and the weather affects the oceans (eg. wind-driven gyres).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
