		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like a few folks have mentioned, Staph is everywhere (such as all over your skin). As long as you don't have any deep cuts, it's not going to get in. Even if it did, your immune system might be strong enough to eliminate the bacteria without the infection becoming widespread, or systemic. Basic beta-lactam antibiotics (think penicillin) are usually strong enough for your run-of-the-mill Staph. </p>
<p>Staph is also in hospitals; however, the Staph there tends to be super Staph. The use of powerful antibiotics in hospitals selects for the biggest and baddest strains of bacteria (the ones that are able to survive most antibiotics), like MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus). These infections are much harder to treat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Give an injury. Give it a warm, dark place with weakened blood supply and it can do a lot of damage. </p>
<p>My wife just almost lost her lower leg to a staph infection. if you get a crush injury, get it cleaned out professionally. </p>
<p>And when people get injured they go to hospitals. And you have a bunch of people going from one patient to another so there is the potential of contamination if one person doesn't properly wash their hands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Staph is everywhere, on our bodies and in our environment.  It is an issue in hospitals because hospitals are full of sick people who are more susceptible to infection than the general population. Staph isn't the only bacteria like this, there are many others which are infection concerns in the hospital that most people with healthy immune systems usually don't have a problem with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because that's where the sick people are. I don't mean that as a wisecrack. That's where the illness-weakened are, and the old and frail.  Oh, and that's also where people have their bodies sliced wide open and exposed to the environment.</p>
<p>Think about it, if we had a special place where people gathered <em>because</em> they're healthy, robust, and strong, (call it an antihospital), and we even had special trucks to deliver them there with lights and sirens, there'd be precious little staph there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By staph I'm going to assume you mean MRSA, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. This species of staph is normal flora on your body, meaning it lives there on your skin,  in your upper respiratory tract,  and GI tract mainly. It only becomes a problem when it ends up elsewhere, like a wound site, or by eradicating the normal flora of another region leaving a new environment for it to grow in. Hospitals are a place where the wounded and immune compromised are found in high numbers, so naturally you have a higher frequency of staph infections there. This is nbd if it's basic bitch staph aureus,  as penicillin will do the trick. but with MRSA the situation becomes more complicated. </p>
<p>But what makes MRSA special?  MRSA is staph aureus that has acquired a genetic mutation that makes it resistant to a large class of our most commonly used antibiotics.  This happened because we essentially selected for them; it is found on basically every person, including the very ill that recieve regular antibiotic treatment. These treatments killed all but the resistant staph aureus, leaving the resistant ones to takes their place. Because of their resistance, we have to bring out the big guns like vancomycin, an intravenously administered antibiotic, and probably another type of antibiotic to keep it from becoming resistant to that. This treatment method keeps MRSA infected people in the hospital, where they can get their germs on stuff and people to be transferred to other sick people. </p>
<p>TLDR: sick people are concentrated in hospitals,  staph likes to infect sick people. Staph is hard to get rid of so it hangs around and keeps infecting people. </p>
