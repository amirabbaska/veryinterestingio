<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl" target="_blank">Thor Heyerdahl</a> proved that sailing across the Pacific ocean in a primitive raft was possible and in later expeditions that it was possible to sail across the Atlantic ocean using primitive technology.</p>

<p>before sails were even commonly implemented</p>

<p>Sails have been in use as far back as 6000 - 4300 BC or even longer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a boat. </p>
<p>The Polynesian people lived on strings of islands for thousands of years, some islands that were close together and some that were further away past the horizon. They were experts at seafaring, had excellent boats, excellent navigation, and understood the cyclical way the ocean current and winds changed over the year to let them go far out and then circle back. They knew what supplies to bring, how to get fish and fresh water on long trips. They could spend weeks at sea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Polynesian people were great boat people and fierce navigators always out in search for new lands to claim. The first people to get to Hawaii were following a flock of birds (Pacific Golden Plover). The birds migrate from Alaska to the South Pacific to lay eggs. Early Polynesian explorers followed these birds as long as they could see streams of them. They knew they had to be stopping at a land mass somewhere, so they would follow them until they couldn't see them anymore and resume next year from the spot they lost them last. It took 400 years for them to find Hawaii. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The prevailing theory out there is people from either SE Asia or Australia set out in large rigger canoes possibly with sails. They bounced further outward from island to island from West to east. Hawaii was the last island(s) to be reached and colonized.  They used the stars to navigate and it was a rather rigorous process and most settlers never returned to the original island.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
