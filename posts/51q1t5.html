		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people already work under the assumption that dark matter exists. All of cosmology just assumes it is there. The real question comes down to what is it made of, what sort of things make up dark matter. We believe it is there but currently only have guesses as to what it might be, what other properties it has and therefor how to even begin looking for it.</p>
<p>So the better question would be how would our understanding change if we discovered it and learned what sort of properties it has, but we jsut don't know enouhg to answer that question yet. Until we can learn more about what dark matter is, we just don't know what consequences it could have on our understanding. Maybe it turns out to be something we have already guessed, in which case maybe not much changes. Maybe it will turn out to be something completely different than anyone ever guessed which could change our understanding quite a bit.</p>
<p>Sorry if it isn't a great answer, but we sadly just don't know much about dark matter yet, and thats why people are trying to find it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like most physics theories, general relativity is of the form &quot;If you know these inputs well, then you can expect these outcomes.&quot; Relativity doesn't tell you how much matter is around, any more than Maxwell's equations tell you how much charge is around. But it does say, if you have a certain distribution of matter, then you should expect these observed behaviors. The problem is, when we plug in the matter distribution we can see, general relativity does not actually produce a good match to observed motions in some cases (notably galactic rotation curves). </p>
<p>So there are two possibilities to investigate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That general relativity is right, but our inputs are wrong because we don't have the right amount of matter to plug in. This is the branch that has led to the dark matter hypothesis.</p>
</li>
<li>That our inputs are right or close enough to being right, and general relativity is wrong. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both options are being pursued. </p>
<p>To validate the dark matter hypothesis, you really need something more than &quot;it exists because it fixes the match-up between relativity and observations&quot;. So the trick is to try to confirm its existence by some means <strong>other than</strong> gravitational influence; for example, seeing it interact in a particle detector. If that is accomplished, then the first of the two options above will be taken to be correct.</p>
<p>This is very much like what happened with neutrinos back in the days of Pauli. Beta decay seemed to violate the laws of conservation of momentum and energy, so Pauli proposed an &quot;unseen&quot; particle that would fix that match-up. It took two decades before the neutrino was actually observed interacting with matter in a particle detector, and those that did find them won Nobels for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is abstract and independent of physics. Math is a useful tool to describe physics, but math can be written that describes the exact opposite to physical laws and still be correct mathematically.</p>
<p>As such, any new breakthrough in our understanding of the physical universe will not (and indeed cannot) have any impact whatsoever on the validity of mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>As other users have already pointed out, the majority of physics in this area assumes that dark energy/matter exists and affects the observable universe, so if it's &quot;found&quot;, investigated deeper and behaves similarly to how we currently describe it, Physics won't change much either. In general, our understanding of Physics is based on our observations of the universe - discovering more details about something won't change the fact that, to date, we've observed behaviour that points to our current understanding of the universe. At this point, most genuinely new discoveries are confirming what we already believe or refining our current descriptions but not changing them too much from what's already in text books.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would not significantly change physics (maths is entirely separate) because it is assumed to exist already. Proving it doesn't exist would be more significant.   </p>
<p>How it would change physics would depend on what dark matter IS. It could be composed of the supersymmetric counterpart of the neutrino, which would confirm the theory of supersymmetry, a theory beyond the standard model.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, something relates directly to my field of study.</p>
<p>Instead of answering what will and what won't change the answer to that is a convoluted, I'll tell you what will happen.</p>
<p>So we found matter that is Dark Matter, now what? Well, the first thing depending on the type of matter it will immediately heavily disfavor some theories while favoring others, is it massive? is it light? What is the spin of the particle? Is it a sterile neutrino? An Axion, or a Neutralino. All of these will point you towards something about the physics, is it SuperSymmetry, is it Kaluza-Klein, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Now beyond the simple physics, the type of dark matter will have cosmological implications. The problem with giving you specific answer is that there way too many branching possibilities which would make this reply a book rather than a small post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
