		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With many devices that have a computer chip inside, unplugging them clears out the memory cache, which is often clogged up with some error.  So when you plug it back in, the memory cache is free to operate as normal again. </p>
<p>With laptops and smart phones, it's often some poorly coded program or website that's eating up a ton of resources and running in the background.  When you reset your computer or smartphone, those background apps usually don't start again until you tell them to.  </p>
<p>Pro-tip: with your laptop go into settings and deselect half the programs that automatically start up when the computer is turned on.  It will load way faster and your system won't be as clunky.   </p>
<p>Edit: Clarifying, I meant that half the programs that are set up to open automatically when you start up your computer are probably bloatware or unnecessary, so you can set it up so that they do not start up when the device is powered on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For computers, RAM is probably a term you hear tossed around a lot. It differs from, say, a hard drive in some pretty major ways. You can think of RAM as the work bench where a computer places files it's using immediately, while the hard drive is storage space. (Trust me this all comes back around to the plug eventually.)</p>
<p>So, when a computer is running, it generally loads a file from the hard drive into RAM, then performs its operations on the RAM copy. There's a bunch more technical stuff to explain, but to answer your question that's pretty much the big thing to know going forward.</p>
<p>So, sometimes when something is going wrong with an electronic whatever, there are messed up programs or files being run out of RAM. And this is where the most important part of this explanation comes in- unlike a hard drive, RAM is impermanent. It relies on a constant supply of electricity to operate, and does not retain its data when its shut down. </p>
<p>So, much like how you can lose a big document you haven't saved in a while when your toe hits the power strip, when you unplug a device, it loses the supply of power to its internal memory. At this point, any data loaded into RAM vanishes once it's discharged, which happens pretty quickly. When you plug it back in you're essentially forcing the device to reload its files back into RAM, which generally fixes the problem unless you've royally mucked up the files on the device's permanent storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you don't hold the handle long enough the shit doesn't get completely flushed down, but once everything is flushed out you got nice clean memory to shit in again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're playing a game of chess and in the middle of the game you realize both bishops are on the same color. You don't remember which piece was which, and you don't know how many moves to go back to fix the problem, so the only solution is to return all the pieces to their starting positions and start again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons why unplugging and plugging it back works so well, as it addresses several modes of failure in hardware at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original connection may be loose. The unplugging and plugging back procedure reseats the connector to a reliable, tightly coupled state.</li>
<li>The connector may suffer from contact corrosion. The unplugging and plugging back procedure scrapes some corroded material, which is often an insulator, off the contact.</li>
<li>Dust may have accumulated in the connector over time and partially shorted out the wires. The unplugging and plugging back procedure shook or blew the dust off the connector and restored the insulation between signals.</li>
<li>The attached hardware may have locked itself in an undefined state. The unplugging and plugging back procedure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_cycling" target="_blank">removes and reapplies the power to the device</a>, forcing it to a known, reset state.</li>
<li>For computer peripherals, the driver on the host computer may also suffer from a state lockup. The unplugging and plugging back procedure forces the driver to unload and reload its state, restoring its functionality. This is akin to force exiting a locked up application and restarting.</li>
