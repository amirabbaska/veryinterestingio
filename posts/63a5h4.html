		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how your brain prioritizes sensory stimuli. The thalamus is the control center for sensory stimuli and it essentially permits certain stimuli to be more in conscious attention like new scents or change temperature. So in your mouth you have chemoreceptors for the main food stimuli which are sweet (glucose), sour (acid), bitter (basic), salty (Sodium ions), and umami (protein/glutamate). Now your saliva is composed of many things namely digestive enzymes and water, so you should taste something technically speaking. Another caveat is that the stimuli must be able to dissolve in order to trigger a receptor. So the reason you don't taste or at least don't perceive the taste is that it is removed from your conscience attention to focus on more pertinent stimuli. The human body really likes to separate &quot;self&quot; from &quot;foreign&quot; so it will highlight exterior stimuli more often than not. </p>
<p>Tl:dr The thalamus tells your brain to ignore your saliva to focus on other stimuli.</p>
<p>Edit #1: You should taste others saliva because of the residual food that is in that individuals mouth. Otherwise humans should have the same proteins in their saliva, so in terms of composition they're identical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ooh i know this. In a neuroethology paper I did in my postgraduate studies, we focused on the function of the cerebellum, as a sort of sensory data processing centre of the brain. One of its key functions, is differentiation between the self and others/the environment ( another the anticipation of movement, consequences for movement etc ). The cerebellums ability to differentiate between the self and others is a survivalist mechanism, that allows for better situational awareness and shaves vital seconds off reaction time. The key way that the cerebellum helps differentiate the self from the environment is by dynamically counteracting continuous afferent stimuli ( constant repetitive incoming signals ) the kind of constant stimuli that the body produces on its own as a byproduct of actually functioning. One of those is the taste of ones own spit, others include the sound of ones own passive breathing, that fact that you don't wake yourself up from your own loud snoring etc. The cerebellum actively cancels this stimuli out because... well, its information that the brain, for the most part deems useless, and blocks, so it can focus on defensive actions and self preservation as indicated by novel and sudden changes in the environment, things that are more important than its own breathing. That being said, you can function pretty well without a cerebellum. Since lack of split second situational analysis is not ESSENTIAL to life, it just helps a lot. There are individuals that have no cerebellum and function pretty well.</p>
<p>tl;dr : it is a part of the brains innate prioritisation mechanisms, repetitive stimuli, like the taste of your own spit, is innately blocked by the cerebellum, hence no taste</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think its more of a adaptation mechanism in our body, we cant taste our tongue or saliva cause we adapted/desensetized to it, its been in our mouth for so long we dont notice it like breathing.</p>
<p>technically saliva does have a taste I cant really describe it and I'm not gonna run to my GF and say hey can I get some of your spit.</p>
<p>but yeah depending on what you have eaten, plaque, etc. can change the taste of spit kinda like tea that seeps in water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
