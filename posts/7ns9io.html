		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean cold water as in near-freezing, the warm effect comes from endorphins released to block the painful freezing sensation in order to maintain function to enable you to get the hell out of the freezing water.</p>
<p>I disagree with the equilibrium theories proposed by others, unless you were to be submerged in a body of water that is only a small fraction of your total volume but still manages to cover you. If the water volume is greater than say a third of your own, you will dramatically cool down as the water in your body and the water around you begin to equalize their temperatures, unless measures are taken to increase your own heat generation. </p>
<p>The body has compensation mechanisms in place to prevent dying rapidly due to hypothermia, including the shivering reflex to increase muscular heat generation and constricting peripheral blood vessels to minimize heat loss from vital organs, at the cost of your extremities cooling down faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert and could be wrong. Water will actually take body heat away about twice as fast as air will. So the average body temp is about 98.6 Fahrenheit. The body is always producing heat through metabolic and kinetic (muscle movement). It just so happens that 98.6 is the perfect temp your body has found for homeostasis. If you were to go into a body of water that was below that at 80 degrees you will start to feel cold sooner. your blood vessels will constrict in you extremities as your body tries to keep blood flow to more important organs (lungs, heart, and the such) to keep them warm. Then you will start to shiver. That's the body's way of producing heat as a last ditch effort. This is why scuba divers will use wet suits to stay warm even if the water is a high 70-80 degree Fahrenheit.                                                                                 Now you can go outside at those temperatures and feel comfortable in little to no clothes. But, if you were in a room set at those temperatures with no other form of energy to warm you up like the sun after a period of time you will get that cold feeling.     As to  your question i think there could be a couple answers.                 1. Your mind tries to block the sensation so you can be more attentive to other things. An evolution perk so predators don't sneek up on us.                                         2. This might be the major cause. As your body constricts vessels and restricts blood flow to your limbs your nerve endings lose sensation and can't feel as well per say. Also since you have less blood flow to your hands the temperature of your hands drop. Like when you go outside in the freezing cold and then place your hands under room temperature water it will feel hot(don't do this for fun it can cause damage). So both are doing the same thing it's just that water does this faster than air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I think it has to do with body heat. In the water, your body heat and the temperature of the water find an equilibrium where both are at the same temperature, whereas in the air, it's always moving so it cools your body while your body heat doesn't have time to affect the air temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whats happening is the water takes heat from you faster than air, and whats also happening is your body freaks out and pulls the blood and heat away from your exteemeties to try and save you before your heart stops.</p>
<p>When you go into cold water like that your extremeties are freezing to the point where you can no longer feel it. Youre technically dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you'll find your answer just as much in the conditions of your question as the physics involved.</p>
<p>Jump in a pool at 60F. Water comes into contact with every square inch of you. It seeps into every crack and is more effective at conducting heat away. So you get a RUSH of cold which over time is less and less of a shock. </p>
<p>Air at 60F? Chances are every time you've been in air at 60F you we're clothed. If you stood stark naked in it you would feel a lot more of that &quot;shock&quot; you get plunging into water.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of other factors like the dryness/absorptivity of skin and the way boundary layers form on the surface of your body in water vs air.</p>
<p>The other day I was in my car at the ski resort. 20 F, I had to change my shirt. Stripped it off and jumped out the car to grab my shirt from the back. Being suddenly shirtless in 20 F was like jumping into cold water.</p>
<p>If it helps, conversely think about ice melting in room temp water vs room temp air. Water gets into every little pore and crack and divet in the ice while air has a harder time &quot;flowing&quot; into those &quot;aerodynamically protected&quot; spots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
