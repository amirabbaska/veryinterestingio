Below are pictures of a large tank with goldfish in, the tank had openings in the side where people could put their hands into the tank and touch the fish. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/SNpSa4a.jpg" target="_blank">Picture 1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3Mx8eRh.jpg" target="_blank">Picture 3</a></p>
<p>What stopped the water from spilling out of the openings? Surely the gravity and weight of the water should push it out and all over the aquarium floor?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When looking at the problem, you have to think about why you think it will spill out. Intuitively, you think the water is PUSHING due to gravity. It's pushing downwards, therefore it should push outwards, right? Partially correct!</p>
<p>Normally in an open system, that is right. If you have a bowl of water above another bowl of water, and connect both with a tube filled with water, sure enough a siphon is formed and water flows from the top to the bottom. This is because the force on the top of the tube is greater than the force at the bottom. To collect the forces, we have on the top the weight of the water, and we also have the kilometre of atmospheric air above it! Then again, at the bottom of the bowl, we also have the atmosphere of air above it, so they cancel out. What you're left with is the weight of the water which means a net force pushing water down. </p>
<p>In the tank example, the tank is likely sealed at the top. Therefore the is NO atmosphere pushing down on the 'top'. The bottom still has a kilometre of air above it, which creates a force bigger than the 2m or so of water. In fact, you can directly convert it, and you find that 1 atmosphere of pressure (that kilometre of air), is roughly equal to 10.3 metres of water. So if you have a tank 10.3 metres high, it'll just about hold the water in.</p>
<p>Any higher, and there will be zero pressure at the top of the tank, which will break your tank. If your tank can hold a vacuum at the top, then the water will start to vaporise and you'll get some funky stuff happening (that's after all the soluble gases bubble out of your water, so no oxygen for the fishes!).</p>
<p>There's another interesting example of our intuition gone wrong. If you ask most people how high they think they could suck some water up a straw (assuming the straw doesn't break), what's the highest it'll go? Most people would not imagine there is a limit. The answer is again 10.3 metres, and that would be if your lungs could produce a vacuum! </p>
<p>If you're keen to go past ELI5, read up on hydrostatics, with the basic governing equation being P= rho.g.h</p>
<p>Edit 1 courtesy of u/accrdt</p>
<p>Edit 2: I don't know where I got 1 km of air from either (it's more like 100km+ as others have pointed out), but it gets the point across. As for those saying it's not ELI5...I struggle to find a better analogy - the straw example is not quite right as it involves capillary forces. Imagine the tank had no floor and was still sealed at the top. The air would still displace the water in the tank. Hopefully people can piece together all the responses to get the right understanding!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top is sealed, AND a vacuum pump is used in that headroom to reduce the pressure.  If it created even slightly greater vacuum, air would start bubbling IN through the ports.</p>
<p>The vacuum pump must be run regularly.  You need to bubble fresh air through somewhere to oxygenate the water, and the CO2 and escaping air must be extracted.  In fact the water will degas more rapidly under the partial vacuum.  </p>
<p>Also, water evaporation up top- again, accelerated by the partial vacuum- will add water vapor which increases the pressure.  It has to be pumped out in an ongoing process.  If the pump stopped- even if there was no backflow of air- the ports will begin to leak water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As stated above, it's most likely sealed at the top. In simpler terms think of it like putting your finger on top of a straw. The water should flow out, but stays in the stray because it is sealed at the top</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So if it's sealed at the top, where does air exchange happen? From my experience with aquariums, which is, admittedly, limited, you need a certain degree of water movement and exposure to air at the surface to release carbon dioxide and oxygenate the water. </p>
<p>Is this part of a larger system with water flowing in and out from a connected reserve behind the scenes  where oxygenation is occurring? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that the water level for all those holes is the same! If they put a lower hole in for short people, air would come in the higher holes and water would pour out the lower hole!</p>
<p>A really nasty trick would be to bring in a U shaped bit of pipe and put in through the hole in the tank so the top of the U goes higher than the hole in the tank. At first water would fill the bottom of the U just to the same level as what's in the holes. But if you were then to blow into the pipe to push air around the bottom of the U, you would make an air siphon so air could rush into the pipe and water come pouring out the holes in the tank. You'd want to get your mouth away from that pipe pretty quick because it will be pulling air in pretty vigorously!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
