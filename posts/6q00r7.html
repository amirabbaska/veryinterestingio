		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You literally cannot, save for occasions where one juror rats out another. This is why good judges try very carefully to guide the lawyers and witnesses to avoid any fatal missteps. If somebody says something that's sufficiently improper or inadmissible, it can result in a mistrial or a verdict that's overturned on appeal. The courts recognize exactly what you have: that some things simply can't be cured with an instruction. </p>
<p>And to be clear, judges don't tell the jury to &quot;forget&quot; the testimony, again recognizing that humans can't do that. The judge will normally instruct the jury to wall it off in their mind, and to remind themselves that they can't consider the stricken testimony. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A judge cannot prevent that from happening, but it is not uncommon for jurors to go to the judge when they feel that other jurors are engaging in misconduct.  (This is more common in civil trials in my jurisdiction where you only need 9 of 12 votes to win.  So even if 9 jurors disregard the instructions during deliberation the outvoted jurors don't hesitate to disclose the misconduct.)</p>
<p>Also, lawyers try to interview jurors after the verdict and ask about things like this which can be evidence for post-trial motions to set aside the verdict.  Source:  am lawyer.</p>
<p>For what its worth - jurors as a rule take their responsibilities very seriously.  I've seen this from talking to jurors post trial and also from the times I have served on a jury.  I don't remember the specifics but in one criminal trial where I was a juror something was excluded and other jurors said &quot;But the Judge said we can't consider that&quot; when someone tried to bring it up.  There's no way that bit of evidence was magically erased from memories, but the jurors absolutely would not actively consider it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In <em>voir dire</em> prospective jurors are always asked whether they will follow the judge's instructions and unless they answer &quot;yes&quot; they are disqualified. So anybody who is actually sitting on a jury has given his word that he will not use the information in the example you give.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no way a judge can do that.</p>
<p>They hope the negative impression given by admonishing the lawyer or witness for saying something improper will outweigh any benefit to the case.  </p>
<p>If the improper statement is too prejudicial, a mistrial can be declared, and the offending party sanctioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
