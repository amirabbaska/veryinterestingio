		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It’s been studied (back in 1990). There is some cross reactivity with the major cat allergic protein (Fel d 1). But the extent of cross reactivity is variable. </p>
<p>“They tested 11 cat-allergic patients against Fel d 1-like structures in eight members of the Felidae family: ocelot, puma, serval, siberian tiger, lion, jaguar, snow leopard, and caracal.  Hair from the big cats were collected, extracted, and used in a RAST system and histamine test. The results showed that all patients had cross-reacting IgE antibodies to seven of the Felidae tested. No IgE antibodies were reactive with the caracal.  Eight of the 10 patient with IgG4 antibodies directed to cat dander also had IgG4 antibodies  directed to several Felidae species, including the caracal.</p>
<p>In general, those with cat allergies also showed an allergic response to big-cat dander, but it wasn’t as strong. Your cat allergies should not deter you from visiting a zoo or sanctuary.  You will be kept a safe distance from the big cats. The study found that this mild big-cat allergy doesn’t usually affect the patients’ lives. “

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies are reactions to specific proteins. There are some proteins that are common to all cats and there are some common to particular species. An example of this is persons with shrimp allergy. Some are allergic to both shrimp and prawns and some are not allergic to prawns because of one of the  exact proteins that shrimp have and prawns do not. So the answer to your question depends on which exact proteins from domestic cats the person is allergic to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.
<em>Fel d1</em>, the dominant cat allergen, is conserved across cat species and similar proteins are present in big cats as well.</p>
<p>So, if you're allergic to house cats, you're probably allergic to other members of the <em>Felidae</em> family.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on if you are allergic to the car or, like me, allergic to the dust that accumulates on my cat's fur. I thought I was allergic to cats because my face would itch when I pet them. But upon allergy testing I found out I'm just allergic to the dust on them, and not the cat dander or anything else to do with the cat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add some info to what was already said. When the human body has allergic reaction, it produces higher that normal amount of special leucocyte, doctors call that &quot;sensibilised&quot; state.<br />
Such human may develop allergy to any other proteins he may or may not meet in the coming years. For example, even though I never touched or even smelled up close those animals, I have a slight allergic reaction to hamsters and horses. It is confirmed by a test, but it is also clear that allergy to cats is stronger and must have been the first to develop.<br />
So, it a person is allergic to something, a person should consider that he/she may anytime become allergic to something else and take care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
