		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I've come across 2 chemicals that regularly cause people to all have similar complex hallucinations.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pittmed.health.pitt.edu/jan_2001/butterflies.pdf" target="_blank">Tetraethyllead</a> - when workers were exposed to hazardous concentrations of the chemical, they contracted lead poisoning, but all reported having a similar hallucinations of &quot;being eaten alive by butterflies&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine" target="_blank">DMT</a> - many uses report seeing &quot;machine elves&quot; when they are hallucinating.  </li>
</ol>
<p>My question is: these aren't merely symptoms like stomach pain, or generalized hallucinations like seeing flashing colors, etc.  These are complex thoughts.  How is it that different people can all experience the same complex thoughts from a simple chemical?  Clearly the information isn't being transmitted by the chemical itself... but it's almost more unlikely that the same information is present in everyone's brain waiting for the chemical to trigger it.  Such would suggest that everyone has the same &quot;I'm being eaten by butterflies&quot; receptor in their brain, waiting to be activated by TEL.  </p>
<p>Or is it just that these drugs all affect the brain in some simpler way and everyone just has the same predictable way of making sense of the hallucinogenic effects?  But then what's there to differentiate one hallucinogen from another?  Why does DMT cause people to hallucinate &quot;machine elves&quot;, but other hallucinogens don't?  </p></div></div>

My own experience with DMT was like a kaleidoscope with no other &quot;entities&quot;.</p>
<p>All brains are wired differently but pretty much all of them use the same chemical schematics to do the job, so shared expereinces can come from that. A chemical change that causes one person to perceive an unknown entity may cause the same effect in another, or it may not. </p>
<p>Keep in mind with altered states of conciousness it be difficult to perceive what is influencing you, one person may say &quot;I'm bring eaten by butterflies!&quot; And cause the rest to manifest the same hallucination. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have time to go looking for it, but assume I pasted in my &quot;there are still no solid answers as to why, at the biomolecular level, the brain does most of the things it does&quot; copypasta here.</p>
<p>Okay, that's out of the way, conjecture time: the human brain seems to have a lot of specialized circuitry dedicated to subconsciously performing vital, complex tasks - possibly because those tasks are (or were) too essential to our survival to wait for acknowledgement from the conscious mind.</p>
<p>The best example I can think of off the top of my head is human facial recognition. If you don't have face blindness (which increasingly seems to be a pretty under-diagnosed condition, but I digress) you can pretty much instantly look at someone's face and know:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether or not you are looking at a living, healthy human's face</li>
<li>whether you are familiar with that specific person</li>
<li>if you are familiar with them, who they are</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that an extensive amount of face-identifying parameters are encoded in the average human mind, and that those parameters do not vary much between healthy individuals (false positives are fairly common, and may rely on the conscious mind to dismiss them, but false negatives - looking at a normal human face and not perceiving it as a face - is almost unheard of if brain injury is not involved).</p>
<p>If a hallucinogenic compound alters neuron behavior in a specific way and reliably reaches one of the brain structures responsible for these &quot;hard-coded&quot; aspects of cognition, it might produce fairly constant mental experiences among different users.</p>
<p>If the visual cortex, at some level, does make a more or less binary determination as to whether your visual field contains [something] - where [something] could be any stimulus we are evolutionarily primed to look for - then it really might be as simple as hallucinogens flipping the &quot;am i looking at a person right now&quot; (or &quot;is there a swarm of insects all over me&quot;, &quot;should i tell the endocrine system to activate the FOF response&quot;, etc) bit from false to true. That's <em>wildly</em> speculative, though, and in my extremely limited experience with neuroscience I have never seen the phrase &quot;it really might be as simple as&quot; be vindicated by research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You often hear &quot;no two people are wired the same,&quot; but by and large our brains are very similar to one another. The information comes from the structure of our neural circuits. For psychedelic hallucinations, candidates are primary visual cortex and the retina.</p>
<p>We see similarly, and so we hallucinate similarly too.</p>
<p>I think we are pretty close to understanding the visual hallucinations. We already have algorithms that can reproduce pretty psychedelic-looking images. Check out Google Deep Dream or /r/deepstyle</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't be too sure about that.</p>
<p>From the bottom-up perspective, even &quot;generalized hallucinations&quot; can consist of extremely intricate shifting patterns that could nevertheless be generated by cruder patterns of neurotransmitter release, e.g. <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/uncoiling-spiral-maths-and-hallucinations" target="_blank">Klüver's form constants</a>.</p>
<p>It's not much of a stretch to think there's a chemical that could cause butterfly-like patterns, e.g. small flickering/fluttering objects, perhaps accompanied by itching/stinging skin sensations if there's a tactile component to the &quot;eaten alive&quot; part.  People are also quite good at distinguishing agents from objects, and even have specific brain regions for (primarily) recognizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_face_area" target="_blank">faces</a>, so I find it plausible that certain types of stimulation could evoke impressions of quasi-human or at least intelligent entities.</p>
<p>And from the top-down perspective, if a certain sensory experience is sufficiently &quot;butterflyish&quot; or &quot;elfy&quot; our brains will pattern-match and naturally fill in some of the gaps.  I suspect that's basically what happens in ordinary dreams, which are at least on par with most psychedelic experiences in terms of weirdness.  It also reminds me of how near-death experiences can contain remarkably consistent themes within cultures, but there's more variation <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18344255" target="_blank">across cultures</a> in whether people see a host of angels or travel across the River Styx/Sanzu, etc.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Complex patterns can emerge from relatively simple sources, and our interpretations of novel/ambiguous stimuli are influenced by our prior experiences.  So lace your DMT with TEL and watch the butterflies eat those machine elves!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to state that there are a lot of people in this comment section that don't know what they're talking about. LSD or mushrooms, for example, can definitely cause you to see hallucinations beyond fractals and kaleidoscope vision. It's totally dependent on dose, set and setting, and personality. While ayahuasca/DMT or peyote can lead to soul bearing visions of dead relatives, the same can be induced by a vast selection of drugs. If you're to take a small dose of LSD, you're not going to have an ayahuasca journey. Use common sense. </p>
