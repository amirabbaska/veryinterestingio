		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very slightly, yes.  Very little [Edit: about 3% worst case] of the energy in sunlight is in UV, but there is some, and if it's absorbed rather than reflected, that will make you warmer. </p>
<p>It's not necessarily true of all suncreen--it would theoretically be possible to make sunscreen that reflected UV rather than absorbing it.  But <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1523/7048/files/Screen_Shot_2018-05-08_at_10.09.59_PM_large.png" target="_blank">UV camera images of suncreen</a> show that it looks black, meaning that it works by absorbing it. </p>
<p>Those cameras are being commercialized for checking whether you applied sunscreen properly, and are <a href="https://sunscreenr.com" target="_blank">supposed to be available sometime this year</a>.</p>
<p>Sunscreen probably has a bigger effect to the extent that it interferes with your natural cooling through sweating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The UV would have been absorbed by your skin. Instead it is absorbed by the sunscreen. The same amount of energy is absorbed either way, so your temperature is unaffected. Some sunscreens increase the amount of radiation reflected, so those would actually lower your temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With organic-based (usually rub-in or invisible) sunscreens, they work to react in a similar way that your DNA does under UV. They undergo a <a href="http://www.rossorg.com/images/stories/News_images/Sunscreen_Photostability_101/Figure5.png" target="_blank">2+2 cycloaddition</a> as shown in that general scheme. This reaction is exothermic so yes, you may feel some heat, but probably the same amount as the mutation of DNA. The sunscreen is basically taking the bullet for your DNA. Since it's a chemical reaction, it's important to <strong>re-apply</strong> it after the recommended time as all the sunscreen will have reacted.  </p>
<p>There are sunscreens that are inorganic-based such as titanium oxides. These typically absorb UV and reflect/emit(?) white light, giving a white sheen on the skin.
