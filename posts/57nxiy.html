		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're basically asking what the limits of human vision are. And you're in luck, there was a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12172" target="_blank">paper</a> published this summer answering that question (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282" target="_blank">summary here</a>). The tl;dr of the paper is that the human eye can detect a single photon. If it happens to be one of the 10% of photons that enter your eye and actually trigger a rod cell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most amazing thing is that it’s not like seeing light. It’s almost a feeling, at the threshold of imagination,” says Alipasha Vaziri, a physicist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, who led the work and tried out the experience himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to actually answer your question. WA <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=international+standard+candles" target="_blank">claims</a> that a candle outputs 13 lumens of light. Which is about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=13+lumens" target="_blank">10^16 photons per second</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to &quot;see&quot; 1 photon per second, then if my math is right (assuming your pupil has a radius of 4mm), you could go up to *<em>[300 km away](<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve+1+%3D+10%5E16" target="_blank">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve+1+%3D+10%5E16</a>++</em>+(2+<em>+(4+mm)%5E2+</em>+pi)+%2F+(4+<em>+pi+</em>+x%5E2)+for+x) and still get that one photon per second entering your eye.**</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> People below have brought up some interesting points. 1 photon/sec isn't really &quot;seeing&quot; it constantly. Humans seem to have a 'frame rate' of ~100 fps, so say we want to see 1 photon per 'frame', and assume that only 10% of the photons entering our eye hit the rod and trigger this photon perception.</p>
<p>Then, to constantly be registering ~1 photon in your eye from the candle the answer shifts to *<em>a distance of [9 km](<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve+1000+%3D+10%5E16" target="_blank">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Solve+1000+%3D+10%5E16</a>++</em>+(2+<em>+(4+mm)%5E2+</em>+pi)+%2F+(4+<em>+pi+</em>+x%5E2)+for+x) (5.5 miles)**. Which is still crazy far away for a single candle.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> This got way bigger than I was expecting. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was assuming a vacuum, but an atmosphere wouldn't change the answer a crazy amount. The Earth's atmosphere (~20km thick) lets through ~30-50% of the light. So it might change things by a factor of ~2.</p>
</li>
<li>Using 'framerate' for how your eye works is a <em>terrible</em> analogy, but I don't have a better one. And yes, fighter pilots and trained eyes can apparently notice things at ~250 fps or 250 Hz, but 100 seems more reasonable for the average person.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The illuminance of a candle (1 candela or 12.6 lumens) from a distance of 1 meter is 1 lux. That of the dimmest stars typically visible to the naked eye on a dark night (magnitude 6) is 8e-9 lux. So we just need to know how far away the candle needs to be to be as bright as a 6th magnitude star.</p>
<p>By the inverse square law, that distance would be sqrt(1/8e-9) m = 11.2 km. From that distance, the candle should be just barely visible to the naked eye. From a tenth that distance (1.1 km) the candle would appear as bright as a 1st magnitude star.</p>
<p>By the way, a 100 watt light bulb is about 130 times as bright as a candle, so (again by the inverse-square law) it could be seen from 11.4 times farther away (128 km). Since the Karman line is at 100 km altitude, it would be possible to see a light bulb overhead in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I think we are forgetting is that since the photons from the candle will not spontaneously decay , meaning they will travel forever until they run into something (our eyes in this case).</p>
<p>Since <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12172" target="_blank">humans can detect a single photon</a> this means we could theoretically see the candle from any distance. HOWEVER it will appear to blink at a certain distance because of how light spreads as it travels sometimes that single photon will &quot;miss&quot; our eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally one I can answer. We just covered this in psychology. Basically you're looking at &quot;absolute threshold&quot; or the minimum amount of stimulus we can detect at least 50% of the time. According to my textbook the human eye can detect a candle flame from 30 miles away under perfect conditions &quot;dark night with no other interfering lights)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
