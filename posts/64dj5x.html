		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a college curriculum, courses are numbered to indicate both the level (100-level courses are more basic than 200-level courses) and, frequently but not always, the sequence of courses (you have to take Biology 101 before you can take Biology 102). </p>
<p>A course with a number of 101 is typically the first introductory-level course offered in a discipline. </p>
<p>Why isn't it 100, though? Well, first, it's the sequency. If you have to take 101 before 102, it's easier to understand and remember that 10<strong><em>1</em></strong> is <em>1st</em> and 10<strong><em>2</em></strong> is <strong>2nd</strong> that it would be to remember that 100 is 1st and 101 is 2nd. </p>
<p>Also, at some institutions, the number 100 is reserved for remedial courses. So as a typical first-year student at a US university, you would be likely to take English 101 in the fall and English 102 in the spring ... but that assumes that you have the basic skills in reading and writing from high school. If testing shows that you aren't quite ready for the college-level English courses, you might have to take an English 100 class to brush up those skills before moving on to 101 and 102. That's only at some institutions, though, and not as consistent as the 101, 102 style numbering. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In college, within a department, first year courses start with a 1, second year with a 2, third year with a 3, etc.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> first year course you take often <em>ends</em> with a 1.  A new freshman in their first semester might be taking Psychology 101, Chemistry 101, and Economics 101.  The second semester general courses would be 102, and a second year course would be 201.  As courses get more specific and electives become involved, the courses are no longer sequential.  Child Psychology might be 335, while Abnormal Psychology might be 470.</p>
<p>Note that this system is not universal, and most colleges today use 4 digit class codes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason hotel rooms often start at 101, because it's helpful to attach 1 to the number to indicate first (floor/year) so as to not later mess it up later. If the rooms on the Hotel's first floor were 1, 2, 3, the second floor would be 101, 102, 103 (or even worse, 45, 46, 47 if we just straight up count). Similarly by attaching 1 to the beginning to indicate first year courses as &quot;101&quot; we can indicate that they're first year courses and &quot;201&quot; or &quot;250&quot; are second year courses and &quot;301&quot; and &quot;375&quot; are advanced/third year courses.</p>
<p>100 is usually reserved as a pre-101 course that is somewhat remedial in nature (e.g, for a person who is capable but for whatever reason isn't familiar, like a returning student who hasn't taken math in 20 years), with numbers from 95-100 being <em>really</em> remedial (I had a friend who had to take Math 97 their first semester of college, which was like high school freshman-level algebra)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really because of college department class numbers.  Numbering systems definitely vary a lot, but it seems that a common way to organize class numbers is to have 100-level classes being undergrad classes, 200-level classes being grad classes or maybe advanced undergrad classes, etc.  Really, the numbering is kind of arbitrary, but there's this convention that the intro class to something is 101.  So as a freshman studying psychology, you'd take Psych 101, which would give an overview of the entire field of psychology.</p>
<p>But class numbers don't have to work this way.  The place where I went to school didn't do that.  In the math department, for example, 100-level classes were undergrad classes and 200-level classes were grad classes, but the general intro classes were 000-level or even lower.  So Math 1a and 1b were first and second semester calculus; Math 21a and 21b were multivariable calculus and linear algebra, respectively; Math 23a/b, 25a/b, and 55a/b were progressively more difficult honors versions of multivariable calculus and linear algebra; Math Xa and Xb were precalculus (I think there were two semesters, but I didn't have to take those).  Then, 100-level classes were the specific stuff.  I think 122 and 123 were Abstract Algebra I and II, 138 was Classical Geometry, 110's were analysis (I took complex analysis but I don't remember what the number was), 140's were logic (didn't take any), 100's were basic proof stuff, and so on.  On the other hand, I took one economics class, Ec 1011a, which was the hardcore version of microeconomics (1010a I think was less math-intensive and 1011b was the hardcore version of macroeconomics, but I only needed the one semester).  The prerequisite (which I didn't take) was Ec 10.  For whatever reason, the economics department had four-digit class numbers.</p>
<p>Then again, I think the college I went to is pretty unique.  Most other places probably have a more standard way of doing things.  And that standard way of doing things is for intro classes to be numbered 101.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
