Links were posted by those opposed to it, but those links seemed more like anti-vax type web sites. Other links popped up supporting the ADA position, but some people didn't trust that either. This is one of the links posted in the discussion that I consider anti-vax-ish, <a href="http://www.nofluoride.com/food_and_water.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.nofluoride.com/food_and_water.cfm</a></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An example: You know Pompeii? How they filled the voids with plaster and it was people?</p>
<p>From those casts and remnants of bone (teeth), they found out people from pompeii had amazing teeth. They decided to look into this, since dental hygiene wouldnt be a thing for a few more hundred years.</p>
<p>Long story short, they found that the drinking water had naturally occuring flouride in it. Along with the only-natural-fruit-sugars of the diet of that time, they had fantastic teeth. </p>
<p>Which is only relatively new data, I just thought its a flavourful addon to the process that lead to it being added artificially - it happened naturally centuries ago to great benefit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because flouride is good for our teeth.</p>
<p>Very very good for them.</p>
<p>Eating or drinking it (via water or table salt) helps to increase your teeths lifespan, and prevent cavities.</p>
<p>Smearing it on your teeth (via toothpaste) also helps to fight off cavities, (it's a slightly different kind of flouride).</p>
<p>The amount of flouride required before it becomes toxic is multiple times what you get from either source, so having it in both water and toothpaste ensures that most people get enough of it, generally without the danger of it becoming toxic. </p>
<p>(You would need to drink some 10 litres of average fliuridated water in one day before it started to become toxic) </p>
<p>Edit: 100 liters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fluoride has been found to prevent tooth decay since the early 1900's, but fluoridation only prevents tooth decay when it is frequently used (brushing your teeth everyday). Since many rural communities in the United States lacked dental care, fluoride was added to water supplies in the early 20th century as a way to provide a more holistic approach.The results shown through these communities were enough to warrant other cities and towns to use fluoride in their water supply and soon became a public health necessity for the United States. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build on some other comments - fluoride can actually help to harden the structure on your teeth. It is believed that the fluoride can replace some of the hydroxyapatite structure in enamel with fluroapatite which is a harder compound that is more difficult to erode.</p>
<p>The level of fluoride in drinking water is quite low. To get the maximal benefit it would be better to use toothpaste or mouthwash which have much higher concentrations of fluoride (all of which are safely below concerning concentrations). These levels are highly regulated by the FDA in the US, as you will see most toothpastes will deliver similar amounts of total fluoride. In addition, fluoride uptake is not 100% efficient so the amount you see on the tube is likely not the amount your mouth will absorb.</p>
<p>The fluoride delivery itself is typically through three common ingredients- sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, and stannous fluoride. Changing the source of fluoride can potentially have additional benefits for your oral health (e.g. stannous fluoride is known to have some degree of sensitivity benefit). This can also influence the total fluoride uptake in your mouth.</p>
<p>One final note is that fluoride is so important for oral health that it's very rare you will find a toothpaste without it that bears the symbol of the ADA. As a previous oral care researcher who worked with fluoride on a daily basis, I believe many of the concerns around fluoride are misguided due to the relatively low exposure levels we actually experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The possible issue with it is how it can potentially ape iodide as they're both halides. Iodine/iodide is vital for thyroid hormone. That's one of the primary question marks. Iodide would actually be a safer and healthier substitute to fluoride as it's something our body wants. Fluoride is a cheap alternative as it's mass produced as an industry waste product. I don't say that to demonize it. There's room for plenty of research in this area with a lot less done than most would think. Having this discussion with anyone is near impossible though because 99% of people don't have knowledge of chemistry and just act scornful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
