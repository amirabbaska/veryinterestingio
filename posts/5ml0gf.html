The sound is produced by the air escaping from between the palms as they come rapidly together. It's like a little explosion.</p>
<p>You'll notice you can clap very softly with your fingers, but the loudest  clap is palm to palm. The palms are slightly cupped, and the compression of these two cup shapes together encloses a larger volume of air, which then has to explode out of the space as the clap progresses.</p>
<p>If you clasp your hands palm to palm and then squeeze, you can hear the air coming out. Clapping is like that, but faster, so the sound is more explosive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Get her to slap still water in a bathtub with the palm of her hand and point out the waves that form, then tell her that when she claps her hands, she's making waves like those but in the air. What might also help is putting a very low frequency sound (~1-2Hz) on a speaker cone, so she can see and then feel the cone vibrating, then increasing the frequency slowly so she can see and feel the cone vibrating faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an excellent magic school bus episode about how sound is made that I think would explain this really well. Ms. Frizzle takes all the kids to a sound museum, and they illustrate sound waves and how they are generated from everything, and how there are different vibrations and wave lengths to the sounds.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess The Magic School Bus has its own wiki and here's a link to the specific episode I'm refrencing  <a href="http://magicschoolbus.wikia.com/wiki/In_the_Haunted_House" target="_blank">http://magicschoolbus.wikia.com/wiki/In_the_Haunted_House</a></p>
<p>I also just checked Netflix to see if they have it, and they do :).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is how I explained to my toddler:  Sound comes from things shaking a little bit, very fast.  Faster and smaller than you could do on purpose (a tuning fork or similar is a good teaching aid here).  Hitting things together is one way to make them move this way.  When a thing shakes like that, it shakes the air beside it, and that shakes the next bit of air, over and over until the shaking gets to your ear.  Inside your ear is a very fragile part (that you mustn't touch because it would hurt), and the way you hear is by that thing getting shaken by the air touching it.  Just like how your hand can feel something doing big slow shakes against it, your eardrum can feel the tiny fast shaking in the air.  Sound can even go through other things that are solid or liquid, because they can shake the same way, some of them even better than air (I had her put her ear to a picnic table while I knocked on it).  This is how you can hear underwater, even with no air inside your ears. </p>
<p>This might all be pitched a little young for a 6-year-old, but it seemed to be an acceptable explanation when I tried it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fill a bowl with water and then tap your fingers together in it. Tell her that the waves in the water are kind of like the waves in the air that we hear. Then let her mess around with it, splashing in different ways and seeing how the water behaves. Probably best to go outside first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
