		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that there's differences in the sugar composition (sucrose as a disaccharide vs glucose/fructose as monosaccharides, and that fruits contain more fructose), but I don't understand why &quot;alternative&quot; sugars like HFCS seem to be a relatively new thing, and limited to basically just corn so far as I'm aware.</p>
<p>In theory, humans have had access to fruit pretty much forever, so why do we only use a few dedicated sugar crops to produce refined sugar, instead of more regionally accessible fruits?</p>
<p>Is it simply a matter of economics, or is there some inherent difference that makes refining fruit sugars impossible?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't specifically answer why fruit isn't refined for sugar, rather than positing an educated guess about relative costs of fructose and fruit at retail, as well as costs of fructose refinement from different sources.  However, the following article may give you some answers you're looking for, with both the science and sociological history of sugar refinement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp89Dh4LzWAhWCxYMKHcevBb4QFggzMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9781489980762-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-1447120-p176365033&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2_-q6MEQq2bM2OXyudd5cT2vYEQ" target="_blank">Sucrose, HFCS, and Fructose: History, Manufacture, Composition, Applications, and Production</a></p>
<p>Some key quotes</p>
<p>1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The history of high fructose corn syrup is linked with sugar, in that HFCS owed its beginning to
demand created by periodic upsets in the supply of sugar. During such times, caused by weather or
political instability in cane-producing regions, sugar supplies became scarce and prices infl ated, causing
a hardship to food and beverage manufacturers. The mid-to-late-twentieth century was an especially
tumultuous time for sugar production with two major price spikes (1975 and 1980) occurring
within a span of 5 years; between 1960 and 2012, retail sugar prices increased sixfold. This created a
window of opportunity for the corn wet milling industry, which had access to a plentiful and dependable
raw material—cornstarch—and was seeking new ways to use it. Existing products such as regular
corn syrups and dextrose lacked suffi cient sweetness and functionality to successfully compete
with sugar. A series of technical achievements serendipitously coalesced around the time of the most
egregious sugar upsets to spur the development of a product with every bit as much sweetness and
functionality as sucrose: high fructose corn syrup. History thus repeated itself, just as sugar supply
issues created an opportunity for the budding beet sugar industry during the Napoleonic Wars 150
years earlier. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although fructose is found in many fruits and vegetables and the primary added sugars, its use as
a food ingredient is fairly recent. Crystalline fructose was available and used primarily in pharmaceutical
applications prior to 1987. The A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company saw untapped opportunities
for fructose in the food and beverage industry because of its unique sweetness and physical and functional properties, licensed crystallization technology from European beet sugar producer,
Finnsugar, and began marketing it to food and beverage companies in the late 1980s. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key learning is that sugars have been a part of the diet for many thousands of years, though
not in the amounts now consumed. The only bona fide challengers to cane sugar—beet sugar
and HFCS—were developed in response to upsets in supply caused by the turmoil of war,
weather, or politics. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to HFCS, a sociological force that I did not see mentioned in the article which definitely drove the economics of sugar was the low-fat craze of the 1970s and 1980s.  Fats were removed from many foods, and to counteract the loss of taste, &quot;added sugar&quot; became an ingredient in many many foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest factor is, of course, economics of food production. Corn specifically has been optimized for production more than any other agricultural product in history. We can grow corn more cheaply and efficiently than anything else on Earth. According to a University of Nebraska paper, corn yields increased from 20 bushels per acre in 1860 to 140 by 2000. Yields are projected to be 300 bushels per acre by 2030.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
