		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anti-venom is made by injecting small amounts of the venom collected from the venomous animal into another animal. The animal's body creates antibodies(things in the blood which attack foreign things in your body that shouldn't be there) to fight off the venom. Then those venom fighting antibodies are extracted from the animals blood and presto. You can now give them to a person who has been bitten and give their body a huge amount of antibodies to help neutralize the venom in their blood before it does more damage. There are some antivenoms that can be used to treat multiple different venoms and also ones that are specific to one kind.</p>
<p>If you ever saw the princess bride you might remember that a character fed himself tiny amounts of a deadly poison to build up an immunity to it. We are doing the same thing but instead of making ourselves resistant to the venom (there are people who have done this though it's stupidity dangerous) we make another animal resistant and then use their blood to extract the antibodies and give them to people who have been bitten. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use an animal that won't die (horse) to produce antibodies against that venom. The only problem is that it's a big allergen and therefore if you were bitten by a rattle snake they would observe you for symptoms before they would give it to you and then they would be ready in case of anaphylactic shock </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the above about anti-venom is spot on.  I just came in to add that there is also human anti-venom.   My mom had to be filled the hell up with horse anti-venom after two copperheads unloaded their venom sacs in her body.  They told her to pretty much just stay away from anywhere that copperheads could possibly be because if she was bitten again she would have to be given human anti-venom which is much harder to find.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

He has sutvived hundreds of venous snake bites in his career and one time I talked to him when he was still alive, he told me it had been looked into to see of blood donated by him, could be used to make anti venom. He was bitten 172 times in his life and lived to be over 100.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
