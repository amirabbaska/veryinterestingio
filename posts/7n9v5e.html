		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the most basic level the body is prioritizing the immediate tasks needed to stay alive (keeping the heart beating &amp; breathing) at the expense of more advanced stuff like processing stimuli and thinking. </p>
<p>Comas can happen for a variety of reasons (trauma &amp; infections being the main ones) and can be induced by medical professionals to keep the body focused on repair when it might not have the resources to both fix itself and fully function. </p>
<p>Edit: Medically induced comas are also used to minimize psychological trauma which might result from being semiconscious while intubated (tube down your throat to your lungs to handle breathing); it’s not a pleasant time.</p>
<p>Edit: There’s a variety of different awareness states &amp; pain relief goals that can be targeted by a provider, which range from local anesthesia where a patient is conscious with a specific spot numbed to general anesthesia where a patient is fully unconscious &amp; unresponsive to stimulus. The approach is dictated by the patient’s particular presentation, history, &amp; the goal of treatment. </p>
<p>If you’re interested in how a “coma” is defined clinically (in treatment like a hospital), you can look at the “Glasgow Coma Scale” which provides gradiations of consciousness depending on patient presentation. </p>
<p>There’s a lot that needs to go wrong to put someone into a comatose state as the body is pretty resilient to outside changes. But if stressed, the body is structured to protect heart &amp; brain function, at the expense of other parts of the body. For example, when cold, the body will constrict blood vessels far from the core (fingers, toes, etc) which saves heat and blood for important organs. </p>
<p>The body can do this successfully because some tissues are more tolerant of being deprived than others, the use of tourniquets for bleeding is a great example. Tourniquets are used to stop massive blood loss on a limb (leg or arm), and when applied correctly, completely cut off blood flow. If you did this to a brain, it would be begin to take damage and die in a matter of minutes, but the limbs can be cut off from blood completely for several hours without tissue death. </p>
<p>A coma is where the body has so few resources that it prioritizes basic functions (heartbeat and maybe breathing if it can be managed) but can’t do anything else. These base functions are typically the last to go before death. </p>
<p>The heart runs on an internal pacemaker, so even if the connection between the brain and the heart fails the heart continues to beat. </p>
<p>You need signals from your brain to breath, but in a hospital setting that can be managed by a machine if your body won’t do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since this is ELI5, there are many factors that can cause coma, but lets simplify:</p>
<p>Brain damage, your brain is like a computer, sometimes circuits can be rerouted and that takes time so your brain has to shut down for a while to do this work. Thankfully, most basic functions to stay alive are automatic, things like breathing and heart beating, even digestion despite the fact that you can't feed yourself.</p>
<p>This can happen from a seizure, an impact, infection, lack of oxygen, stroke, or other problems.</p>
<p>Self preservation, some events can cause so much damage to the body that continued function would lead to death, as a product of evolution designed to survive, your brain can turn you off to take time to perform repairs and try its best to keep you from dying.</p>
<p>This can happen from overdoses, chemical imbalances, even poor nutrition causing nervous system malfunction.</p>
<p>For adults  wanting a little more depth than  a five-year-old; Hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes are all common causes of coma. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to ask a follow up question on this. Why is it that some comas last for several years, decades or even forever, long after any damage has been fixed? Does the body not have enough control to wake you up again? And why can't we medically wake someone up?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
