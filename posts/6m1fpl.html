		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been hot as hell lately and got up to 100 yesterday. I started to wonder why I was sweating and feeling like I'm dying when my body is 98.6 degrees on the inside all the time? Why isn't a 98 degree temp super comfortable? I would think the body would equalize and your body wouldn't have to expend energy to heat itself or cool itself.  </p>
<p>And is there a temperature in which the body is equalized? I.e. Where you don't have to expend energy to heat or cool. An ideal temperature. </p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the replies and wealth of knowledge. After reading a few I remembered most of high school biology and had a big duh moment. Thanks Reddit! </p>
<p>Edit: front page! Cool! Thanks again!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a like a heater that is always on; it cannot be turned off because that heat is produced by and required to maintain a delicate environment for your life processes.</p>
<p>Heat only flows from hot to cold. If temperatures are equal, there is no cold for the hot to flow to.</p>
<p>If 98F is ambient temperature then the constantly-produced heat in your body has nowhere to flow to. The heat will build up in you and you will overheat.</p>
<p>The rate of heat flow is proportional to the difference between the hot and the cold. Even if your internal temp reaches 105F+ and outside is 98F the heat flow would be small.</p>
<p>We evolved sweating as a way to cheat this by using evaporation to pull away heat from our skin. When water evaporates, it actually cools down when doing so, because changing a liquid to a gas takes energy (heat).</p>
<p>This works so long as the surrounding air isn't already full of water. Once it is full, sweat stops evaporating and you will overheat no matter what. This kills people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_resistance" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_resistance</a>
There is only so much heat (Tj max) our bodies can withstand. The ability to dissipate heat reduces with higher ambient Ta temperature. Humidity affects the thermal conductance to the outside world.
Edit: a word</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your body puts about the same heat out as a 50w lightbulb.</p>
<p>You're constantly making heat, constantly metabolizing. </p>
<p>If it's around room temperature, you are able to radiate the heat away without using any sweat. The variance in temperature is able to keep you feeling fine as is.</p>
<p>But the closer you get to the temperature our bodies run at, the less heat you are able to passively let off. So you sweat to use the power of evaporating water. Assuming it's not humid out this works well for a while, in fact, it works even past our own body temperature so long as you stay hydrated. But if it's kinda muggy out, then you can't lose the heat faster than it builds.</p>
<p>And so. You overheat. Just like a car going through a desert. The coolant and engine is hotter than the outside, but as outside nears closer to the car's temp, it can't drop all that heat away fast enough.</p>
<p>[Edit: Wow this blew up! I hope my explanation makes sense to you all. I tried to ELI5 it as much as possible so even the people from the back of the class understand it)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal body temperature is said to be 37C (98.6F), but this is actually not the complete story.</p>
<p>Your core temperature (deep inside where your internal organs are) is at 37C but your peripheries (skin) is much cooler, and may approximate your surroundings. We feel &quot;normal&quot; or comfortable when our skin temperature approximates normal room temperatures.</p>
<p>Your body maintains a warm core and cooler peripheries by constructing blood vessels near the surface. When your body gets hot, your body dilates skin blood vessels and allows the warmer central blood to get to the skin, and radiate that heat away. This is assisted by sweating, which provides evaporative cooling. You will notice in hot weather your skin blood vessels are prominent, but in cold weather they shut down to preserve the warm blood centrally.</p>
<p>When it's hot, you will also do behavioural things to cool down: take clothes off, fan yourself (helps sweat to evaporate) and lift arms away from body to increase surface area.</p>
<p>TL;DR: only the body's core is at 37C, your skin is much cooler, and that skin temperature is what we find comfortable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build on points previously mentioned, 98.6 degrees F is your internal body temperature.  Your skin temperature is significantly lower than that.  Something in the 70s if memory serves as part of the process /u/PoweRaider mentioned for venting heat.  You're uncomfortable because there's a 20 degree temperature swing between your skin and the air and your body is trying to add more heat to an already heat rich system.  It's the same thing with why your air conditioner doesn't do well in 100+ degree F temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
