		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The piano works by pointing the right joycon into the body of the box and pushing a key changes what the IR camera views (I'm guessing it lifts small paddles on the inside via lever motion). The camera can detect basic shapes easily and determine distance of objects so that must play into how it works too. The software the kit comes with interprets what the camera sees and outputs the corresponding notes.</p>
<p>The robot vr backpack looks like it uses the gyrometers (things that can sense motion) of the left joycon headset piece to determine view while it uses the other gyrometers on the right joycon to detect when your ducking. It then uses the ir camera again, to look at the position of markers inside the backpack controlled by pulleys, rubber bands and string. When you pull the strings it pulls on the tab with the marker on the inside up, and the camera can see that info to tell which arm your moving. </p>
<p>The rc car works like a hexbug nano but has dual drive lol the way the legs are shaped, the vibration makes it move forward incrementally. If only one side rumbles, it turns to <del>that</del> <em>the other</em> side.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: This is really a kit for creating non electric peripherals that mechanically give info to the gyros and IR camera. It isn't pretending to play with that stuff you make, they interact with the joycon to become actual controllers of what your doing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The right side Joy-Con has a little infrared camera and illumination LED. You can see how it all works in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Bd3HUMkyU&amp;t=129" target="_blank">this</a> segment of the video (pause and look closely a the scenes from that point on). The moving cardboard bits have white markers attached. The camera captures an image, and the software looks for the motion of these markers to determine which pieces of cardboard have moved. It seems you can probably customize the layout of the detection (by defining rectangular regions of interest that detect when a particular white marker enters or leaves them) to build your own contraptions.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's an <a href="https://mrcn.st/t/labo.jpg" target="_blank">annotated diagram</a>.</p>
<p>For the moving &quot;robot&quot;, the cardboard body is designed so that when the joy-cons vibrate, the robot moves preferentially in one direction (thanks to the angled comb-shaped &quot;legs&quot;). By choosing which side is vibrating (or both), you can steer the robot around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is using the joy-cons to their fullest.  It uses the buttons (obviously), motion controls, and the IR sensor (least obviously).  I'm sure they will use the HD rumble which is apparently very good, though under utilized.</p>
<p>The IR sensor can basically read a layout of white objects in front of it (in a dark enclosed environment, especially).  Think of it as reading a chessboard equivalent (it can probably do much better), and reading the positions of things in the squares.  It is easy to imagine that moving one piece back and forth across one or more squares could easily be treated the same as a button push or motion control that we use so often now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you watch the video closely you see that in all of the cardboard devices they Place one of the joycons in them. The joycons have gyro sensors in them and the red one has an IR sensor. These allow the movement of the cardboard devices to be translated to input for the games or applications, whatever you want to call them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
