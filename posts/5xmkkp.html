		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two components to your question. First is why fusion is possible in the Sun's core, second is why our fusion reactors need to run at much higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The second question is easier to answer, so I'll go for that one first.</p>
<p>The Sun actually produces so little power by volume that it would be completely impractical to reproduce the conditions of the Sun's core in a fusion reactor, <em>even if we could somehow do so</em> (we can't, because containing plasma at such pressures would be incredibly difficult and dangerous). The Sun is producing a lot of energy because it's so huge, but the actual power release per volume is only about a quarter of human resting metabolism.</p>
<p>You would literally get four times more thermal power out of a regular, resting person, than you could out of a human-sized chunk of solar core material.</p>
<p>So reproducing the Sun's core would make even a reactor of gargantuan size produce very little power. You'd quite literally need a star-sized reactor for a significant power output... and we already have that (albeit at 1 AU distance). What we need for practical fusion reactors is a significantly higher energy density, and for technical reasons, that involves a much higher temperature to get the fusion yield higher.</p>
<p>The explanation on why fusion can occur in the Sun and other stars requires a longer explanation, which has to go a bit deeper into those technical reasons.</p>
<p>Fusion is what happens when two light atomic nuclei collide hard enough that they overcome their electrical repulsion, come into &quot;contact&quot; with each other, and discover that forming one large nucleus is energetically more favourable than existing as separate nuclei. So they merge, and release some high energy photons, and sometimes some leftover particles are also ejected. For example, when tritium and deuterium nuclei come together like this, they form one helium nucleus, and one leftover neutron is ejected.</p>
<p>The more detailed reason as to why this happens is that there is a force called strong interaction, which is incredibly powerful at short ranges and is the main thing responsible for holding together not only protons and neutrons within atomic nuclei, but actually it is the force that binds together the quarks that form the protons and neutrons themselves. When two nuclei approach each other, they are strongly repelled from each other by the electric force (often called the Coulomb barrier), <em>but</em> if they get close enough, then the incredibly strong nuclear force will overcome the repulsion and bind the nuclei together. And sometimes eject something. Depends on the reaction.</p>
<p>This is actually also why the amount of neutrons increases along with the protons as you go up the periodic table of elements - with protons alone, the electric repulsion is not strong enough to hold the nucleus together, and you need neutrons to increase the strong interaction while not contributing to the electric force. So, the neutrons act as a glue that holds large nuclei together - but only up to a certain point. After the number of protons reaches a certain amount, the sheer size of the nucleus becomes so large that the strong interaction provided by the increased neutrons can no longer hold it together, and the nucleus becomes unstable. This means it will at some point eject something in order to reach a more stable configuration; this is called radioactive decay, and the ejected something are what radioactivity is. This is also the reason why, say, Uranium-238 is much less radioactive than Uranium-235; the three additional neutrons make the nucleus it more stable... But I digress. Back to fusion.</p>
<p>Obviously, fusion doesn't happen easily, as evidenced by our existence. There are two main barriers in the way of fusion reactions happening. The first one is obviously that atomic nuclei are normally bound with electrons around them, forming actual atoms. The first thing you need to do is to get rid of the electrons entirely, which is something called ionization. This is done by heating the gas so much that the atoms shed their electrons by collisions with each other, and the high heat keeps them from re-binding into atoms.</p>
<p>So now you have a plasma with free atomic nuclei surrounded by a free electron soup, hopefully contained in some way because otherwise it's going to just expand and cool off almost immediately.</p>
<p>But this alone is not enough. Since atomic nuclei consist of positively charged protons, and neutrons with no charge at all, they are strongly repelled from each other by the electric force. So getting them to come into &quot;contact&quot; with each other is very hard, and that means they have to collide very violently in order to defeat the energy barrier created by their electric fields.</p>
<p>However, if you increase the collision energy high enough - over the Coulomb barrier - the collisions will eventually bring the two nuclei close enough that the attractive force of the strong interaction overcomes the repulsive force of positive electric charges, and fusion can occur.</p>
<p>Actually it turns out that fusion occurs at significantly lower collision energies than expected simply by na√Øve analysis based only on the relative strengths of electric repulsion and strong nuclear attraction, but it is still a good basic summary of the problem. The reason for the lower energy requirement in reality is due to quantum physics: The nuclei basically have a certain probability of quantum tunneling through the energy barrier, achieving a closer proximity to each other than classical physics predicts, which means that <em>sometimes</em>, even at &quot;too low&quot; energies, fusion will still occur. And if that distance is small enough for the strong interaction to take the wheel... well, fusion happens. And it turns out that this process is actually significant enough to be a big deal for stellar fusion, as the temperature and pressure withing the cores of stars is just too low to break the Coulomb barrier.</p>
<p>Regardless of the minutia of how the nuclear fusion is achieved, the important thing to realize here is that as far as particle collisions are concerned, pressure and temperature are kind of interchangeable. Increasing the temperature makes the collisions more high-energy, but increasing the pressure means there's more of them happening. More collisions happening means you'll get more quantum tunneling going on, and thus you start getting some fusion out of this mess even though you're too low to break the Coulomb barrier.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Sun's core is compressed by the gravity of all the mass of the Sun itself around it. The density itself is actually surprisingly low, &quot;only&quot; about 160 times the density of water (160000 kg/m^3). It's still way more dense than any element we can handle in solid form - depleted uranium, for example, is about 19,050 kg/m^3 in density, which is only about 1/8th of the density of the Sun's core, but it's still a number we can understand well enough. A litre of the Sun's core would weigh 160 kg, though. This density, at 15 million degrees temperature, is enough to bring a great number of protons to a close proximity to each other, which increases the chances of the quantum tunneling happening through sheer statistical probability. And there was light.</p>
<p>By contrast, the plasma densities we can achieve are pretty much limited by how strong a magnetic field we can produce, and compared to gravitationally compressed plasma, it's not actually all that high. We can achieve very high pressures in small scale, like with a diamond anvil (high enough to allegedly turn hydrogen into a metallic phase), but containing fully ionized plasma at such pressures and at large scales would quite likely be impossible. And like explained in the short explanation, even if we <em>could</em> do it, it would not actually help make a useful reactor, so increasing the temperature is probably the only way we can do it.</p>
<p>Basically, if we want a high enough fusion yield out of the plasma to actually cover the expenses of running it, we simply cannot rely on the quantum tunneling, we <em>have</em> to break the Coulomb barrier. If we can do that consistently, and with a good fusion yield, then the thermal energy yield should be quite substantially more than it took to run the reactor (heating the plasma to fusion temperatures and containing it during the reaction), but so far it's proven to be rather an extreme technical challenge to get a net yield of energy out of it. Aside from thermonuclear bombs, of course, but those are not very practical for energy production...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>15 million kelvin is only 1.2 keV, the fusion barrier between two protons is about 500 keV. The only possible way fusion can happen in the sun at all is by one proton tunneling through this energy barrier. Tunneling is slow. It only happens in large quantities in the sun because there's a lot of hydrogen there. Tunneling in the lab would be a very rare event because we just don't have enough material.</p>
<p>I see a lot of replies here which kinda skirt around the issue. This is the most accurate answer there is. As a side note, your number of 100 million degrees in the lab is 861 keV. The Coulomb barrier for tritium on deuterium is only ~450 keV. So 100+ million <em>is</em> enough energy for the reaction to occur without tunneling.</p>
