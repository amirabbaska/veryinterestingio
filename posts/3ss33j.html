<p>I assume the flame in the ring is more visible because the hot gasses in the vortex ring barely get mixed with outside air and stay concentrated &amp; hot while the main jet of hot gasses will extinguish quicker because it gets mixed with more outside air</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: The combustion products of the gunpowder (and some powder that is still combusting) mixing with ambient atmosphere. The ring itself is being pushed by the overpressure wave exiting the muzzle.</p>
<p>All firearms produce muzzle flashes. A flash hider/suppressor is sometimes used to redirect the gas into discrete jets so that the user's sight is unimpeded. In a rifle suppressor, the amount of heat and pressure produced is often so high that it ignites ambient atmosphere and as a result special materials (like the kind you see in rocket engines, such as inconel) are used.</p>
<p>So that's a lot of energy, right? Not all of it needs to be used to push the bullet, and isn't: Just beyond the chamber of of the barrel there's a tiny hole that uses some of that gas to work a piston just underneath the barrel, which in turn is what drives the action of the gun. A fundamental design that has been used in rifles and machineguns for over a century. The DE is unique in that it's one of those rare gas operated pistols; it shares more of its DNA with rifles than it does with your typical semiauto handgun; most of those use the recoil generated by the barrel instead of gas pressure to work the action.</p>
<p>The designers of the original AR15 platform of rifles, from which the M-16 was developed, realized that you don't even need a piston: You can just let some of that hot gas impinge inside of a carrier in the heart of the rifle's mechanism and it works just as well (albeit dirtier).</p>
<p>tldr #2: The same stuff that produces that ring is actually being used to operate the gun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As to why a ring, the answer is it works just like any other ring (toroidal) vortex -- like a smoke ring.  You push a fast moving blob of air into a stationary one.  The moving air interacts with the stationary air because of viscosity, and that friction slows the outside of the moving air. The core of the moving air moves forward faster than the outside of it now, so the edges move backward, relative to the core, to the point they are at the rear of the fast moving air.</p>
<p>Moving air has lower pressure, so the fluid from the edge is pulled into the core of the blob, making a jet which separates the blob into the ring shape. Sides opposite the jet will counter-rotate, relative to eachother. All sides radially push in on the jet.  Think of holding a ball in your hands and push in your thumbs while rotating your wrists out and you'll see how it works.  As that air is ejected, the outer edges of the rings slow because of friction, and maintain the jet.  It's very stable, and can last for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a thorus because of a similar effect like in this video <a href="https://youtu.be/pnbJEg9r1o8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/pnbJEg9r1o8</a></p>
<p>Just imagine the plate being a bullet and it happens in one medium and not at the border between two media (mediums?). </p>
<p>So basically bullet starts a circle shaped vortex by pushing away (to the sides, up and down) the air in front of it and sucking in the air behind it (because of the lower pressure zone behind the bullet). </p>
<p>The stuff that is still combusting is sucked into this vortex, hence the &quot;fire ring&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A toroidal vortex of hot gases,  caused by the supersonic jet that leaves the barrel interfacing with the relatively stationary air down range of the muzzle.  It wouldn't happen if you fired the gun in a vacuum,  the gasses would all just continue in an expanding cloud down range. See also,  smoke rings. </p>
<p>tl/dr    the ring of fire is a  toroidal vortex of incandescent ionized gas, formed by the high velocity gas pulse from the bore,  like a smoke ring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
