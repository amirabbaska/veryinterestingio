<p>If you try to produce an outcome by altering a specific metric, altering the metric becomes the goal, rather than producing the desired outcome.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say I am driving a car.  On the dash I have a tachometer, a speedometer,  a fuel gauge, and an odometer.  These things all measure something different about the behavior of the car, and from the totality of these things I can understand something broader about the operation of the vehicle.  These instruments however are not complete.  For example I don't want to go at 100 miles an hour.  I don't want to travel 100 miles.  I don't want to use no more than a quarter of a tank of gas.  What I want to do is go to my Grandmother's house and not spend a fortune getting there.</p>
<p>So my actual goal... that isn't displayed.  Just different meters showing things that are relevant to me getting to the goal.</p>
<p>But lets say I have an environmentalist in the car for this trip.  And he says &quot;look, its all well and good to go to your grandmother's house, but we should try to use as little gas as possible.  Can you do something to keep that needle from moving?</p>
<p>The answer of course is yes...  I can slow down.  In fact the slower I go, the less that fuel gauge needle seems to move.  I can even stop it totally if i pull over and shut off the car.</p>
<p>Or I could take a detour that adds a long distance to the trip but is mostly down-hill, or smooth driving so for each hour I drive the gage seems to stay more stable.</p>
<p>Heck, I might even be able to add gasoline to the tank as we drive to make the needle to up!  Now that isn't what the environmentalist wanted, and slowing down isn't what I wanted either.</p>
<p>The economy is much more complex than a car, and obviously when we are driving it is easy to say &quot;well look you are just gaming the number, that isn't what I really wanted.&quot;  But when we are talking about the economy more generally that is MUCH harder to do, and it is easy to trick yourself into thinking that you have managed to manipulate the number in such a way as that it is still giving you informative data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the famous unintended consequences story I learned in intro economics. </p>
<p>When Hanoi, Vietnam was under French rule, the colonial regime created a bounty program that paid a reward for each rat killed. To obtain the bounty, people would provide the severed rat tail. Colonial officials, however, began noticing rats in Hanoi with no tails. The Vietnamese rat catchers would capture rats, lop off their tails, and then release them back into the sewers so that they could procreate and produce more rats, thereby increasing the rat catchers' revenue.</p>
<p>The government implemented a metric of &quot;# of rat's tails&quot;. Once this became policy the goal became &quot;create rat tails&quot; not &quot;fix rat overpopulation&quot;. </p>
<p>This is an extreme example where the metric actually causes the opposite effect. But the idea is the same. Once the metric is officially and publicly used to measure success, it is no longer useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>let's take an example if a country makes reducing unemployment rate as their goal. unemployment rate can be used as measure to see how well a country's economy is doing, lower unemployment rate normally means that economy is doing well, and vice versa. but, instead of making policy that help grow the economy and thus reducing unemployment rate, they make a policy &quot;if you become unemployed and don't get a new job within a week, you are forced to go back to school&quot; (since students don't count against unemployment rate). it makes unemployment rate to practically near zero (since no one become unemployed for more than a week), but it doesn't mean that the country's economy is doing well, the government just game the system to get near zero unemployment rate. thus unemployment rate ceases to be a measure of economic well being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong but from reading up on it I think the point is when a measurement of something is targeted people will start attempting to reach that target via most means resulting it the initial measurement being less valuable.    </p>
<p>Take for example the time it takes for the first bag on an aeroplane to reach the carousel. It seems like a good way to measure how efficient your staff are and how to keep flyers happy so you now set a company target &quot;the first bag has to reach the carousel in 5 minutes of the flight landing&quot;. That now drives the baggage handlers to focus on getting the bag there quick as possible so they get the fastest runner to jump into the hold, grab one bag and rush to the carousel so that they hit the target. The rest of the handlers now take 5-10 mins to get the others there with no concern. </p>
<p>The main point is targets drive behaviors so people working to those targets will attempt to find ways to meet the target that doesn't necessarily meet the initial intentions of the metric/target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
