		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to point out it HAS a significant and measurable effect on neurobiological mechanisms and physiological response. It won't cure cancer, but it can measurably boost the immune system, lower pain response, increase motor function and so forth, without the effects being just a poor perception of treatment quality. </p>
<p>The mechanism of action is not entirely understood, not because it's such a mysterious effect or that it's unlike anything else we've encountered, it's simply because the human brain is not entirely understood in general. This is why it's an active are of research. We also don't know exactly every single way certain neurotransmitters affect our neurological functions so simply measuring those don't unveil the whole picture. Not to mention studies on neurotransmitters are often done with surveys and imaging rather than physical examination (otherwise we'd have to crack open skulls a lot more often). Brains are also more complicated than a  bunch of transmitters bubbling in a biological circuitboard. Every person responds differently and their psychology (call it unique brain structure) plays a huge role.</p>
<p>I can't go into the exact details because I don't feel qualified enough on such a large subject to not make misinformed claims, but I can link you to a very comprehensive paper that goes into exactly what you're asking
<a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/45/10390" target="_blank">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/45/10390</a></p>
<p>To summarize: hormone secretion and the release of neurotransmitters (like endorphins) can be mediated by a psychological response. Placebo and expectations of treatment, conscious and subconscious, are one of these responses. If you don't know what endorphines are, they're an opioid peptide (your bodys own opioid molecule) that binds to opioids receptors in your brain and causes paik relief and euphoria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of things that can contribute to the placebo effect, but that doesn't mean they &quot;work.&quot; It just means that you (report that) you feel better after taking them. In illnesses where there is an outcome you can actually measure, there is no placebo effect*. </p>
<p>Things that make up the placebo effect include:</p>
<ul>
<li>reversion to the mean: your condition naturally gets worse and better over time, and you only go see a doctor when it's at its worst</li>
<li>natural progression: your cold will get better in a week no matter whether you take vitamins, herbal supplements, cough syrup, a placebo or nothing</li>
<li>poor memory: do you really feel better? How well can you actually compare it to how you felt last month? Especially when combined with...</li>
<li>patient expectations: the nice doctor gave you a pill, so you <em>must</em> feel better. Even though you don't quite remember it that way. </li>
</ul>
<p>And there are lots of other errors that can crop up in a clinical trial all building up the placebo effect. Maybe patients said the problem was worse to get a doctors attention, or a doctor exaggerated symptoms to get them on the trial. Or maybe the patients who took the placebo and didn't get better dropped out of the trial. Or maybe there's more subtle things going on. </p>
<p>Scientists don't compare things to a placebo because there's a magical placebo effect healing people, they use the placebo to measure all of these hard to spot factors and then hope that a drug does perform even after all these hidden effects are taken into account. </p>
<p>^(* the strongest placebo effects are measured in things like pain and depression which have to be self reported, and it could be argued that if you've convinced yourself you feel better, then the placebo has worked. If things like rashes or blood chemistry is independently measured the placebo effect fades away.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can break the placebo effect down into a couple of categories of sub-effects.</p>
<p>Things that would happen regardless. Meaning that you seek no treatment and these things still happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>immune response (a disease running its course)</li>
<li>natural healing factors</li>
<li>abatement of short-term or acute symptoms (e.g. a headache)</li>
<li>regression toward the mean (also the cause of some aspects of the &quot;nocebo effect&quot;)</li>
<li>accidental cure of the underlying problem through routine daily activity (e.g. a headache caused by caffeine withdrawal or dehydration)</li>
</ul>
<p>Purely psychological aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirmation bias: If you hope/expect a treatment to work you might be predisposed to notice evidence of it doing so, and discount or forget evidence against.</li>
<li>psychological priming and mood effects: If I gave you a glass of wine and told you that it came from a $50 bottle then you would perceive it to taste better, you would enjoy the experience more. This isn't an illusory effect, you would <em>actually</em> enjoy it more, it would <em>actually</em> taste better to you. Similarly, the placebo effect can make you <em>feel</em> better even if it does nothing. For symptoms that are themselves primarily &quot;in your head&quot; such as pain or depression, this can be a substantial effect.</li>
<li>reporting: If the thing being treated is something that requires reporting and can't simply be measured directly and objectively then you not only have the above effects on how people feel but you have other psychological effects. You might think &quot;well, it didn't work for me, but I'm sure it works for other people, I don't want to be rude, I'll just say it worked a little for me.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Actual physical effects. These are much less well-studied, partly because of the difficulty of studying them (how do you study the physical efficacy of placebos?), but there is some known effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduction of psychological stress: Placebos can reduce stress, and stress can have negative health effects, so removing that stress can have positive health effects. Cortisol, a stress hormone, can depress immune response and disrupt sleep, for example.</li>
<li>lifestyle changes: If you feel down you might be tempted to reach for other remedies or crutches to make you feel better such as drugs, alcohol, &quot;comfort foods&quot;, etc. If these are unhealthy then they might make recovery of some underlying condition more difficult. For example, alcohol actually disrupts deep sleep so if you use alcohol to help you fall asleep you will often feel less well rested the next day.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be major factors for almost any disease or ailment. For example, even with something as serious as cancer that you can't simply use &quot;happy thoughts&quot; to get through there will be a natural remission rate just due to your body's own anti-cancer systems (your immune system et al). And if that rate is even modestly improved by the last few things on the list above (stress reduction and improvement of immune response, sleeping better, eating better, maybe even exercising, and so forth) then that can potentially have a modest impact on survival rates. That shows you the possible extent of the effect. This is why treatments are always measured relative to a placebo. Because even a placebo vs. nothing can have significant effects across an enormous range of conditions, not just in reported results but in actual measurable physical improvements as well. The human body is an incredibly complex mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Placebo is an effect in the data, not in the patient. We can test this, for example, by treating people's asthma with nothing, a placebo and real medicine. Then we ask them how they feel <em>and</em> measure lung function.</p>
<p>When you compare the results of asking the patient, placebo performs like medicine. When you measure lung function, placebo performs like no treatment.</p>
<p>We find that placebo only turns up in data that is subjective and continuous. Binary results like cure/no cure or objective tests do not show placebo effects. If placebo had a real, clinical effect then we'd see it when we were objectively evaluating the patient too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the criteria for success are stringent and meaningful, such as 90% clearance of psoriasis (PASI90), a few percent of the placebo group achieve this. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057361" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057361</a>.
