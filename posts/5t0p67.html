		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tax exempt status is allowed for nonprofit organizations that are operated exclusively for religious, educational, scientific or other charitable purpose. There are a few more rules, but those are the two big requirements: (1) nonprofit and (2) religious, education, scientific, or charitable.</p>
<p>As you can see, churches don't get special treatment over other nonprofits. However, you might still ask why &quot;religious&quot; organizations are included at all. One reason is that it helps maintain separation of church and state. As the Supreme Court noted in one of its earliest decisions regarding a national bank, the power to tax is the power to destroy. By not taxing churches, the state removes itself from interfering in church business and also makes sure the state doesn't start relying on church taxes for its operation.</p>
<p>Another reason is that historically churches were important charitable and social centers. That's still true for many churches today, but it was even more apparent when the tax laws were first being made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Churches are exempt because they are non-profit organizations. The money they collect goes to paying for staff (preacher, secretary, cleaners), maintenance of the building/property, improvements to the building/property, and the various ministries that they participate in (food pantries open to the public, soup kitchens, helping the poor with bills, building wells in Africa, etc). There is no owner and are no stockholders making profit off of the money they collect and services they provide. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government gives an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c\)_organization" target="_blank">large variety of organizations tax exemption</a>, churches are just one type.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other charities (with the added bonus of donations to the group reduce the donor's taxes, too) this includes almost anything with a loose tie to education</li>
<li>Industry trade groups and unions</li>
<li>Sports leagues</li>
<li>Social clubs</li>
<li>political organizations (both campaign groups and advocacy organizations)</li>
<li>co-operative corporations (REI doesn't pay income taxes either)</li>
<li>Credit Unions</li>
<li>Unions</li>
<li>Pensions</li>
<li>Veterans groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Churches are just one type of these groups, that also perform actions to benefit their members (remember social clubs and sports leagues are on the list too) and the broader community (like organizing schools or hospitals).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The federal tax code makes organizations that meet certain criteria tax exempt. &quot;Being a religious organization&quot; is enough to qualify under current law, but let's just pretend that it wasn't for a minute. </p>
<p>Even if it weren't, churches would pretty much all still meet the criteria (see below!) and thus qualify for tax exempt status. So the only way of <em>excluding</em> churches from tax-exempt status would be discrimination on the basis of religion. That's unconstitutional under the First Amendment. </p>
<p>Also, at this very moment, there are churches that <em>don't</em> qualify for tax-exempt status because they violate other rules for tax-exempt status. I'm not talking about the <em>highly</em> debatable notion that churches risk their tax status be engaging in political activities. Set that aside for the moment. No, I'm talking about rules that prevent the benefits of any nonprofit, tax-exempt organization from &quot;redounding to a particular person or persons,&quot; i.e., using a tax-exempt organization as your own personal slush fund. The most egregious example would be someone routing their earned and presumably taxable income through a tax-exempt entity that then pays all their living expenses &quot;charitably&quot;. That's called &quot;tax evasion,&quot; and turns out to be an <em>excellent</em> way of <em>going to jail</em>. </p>
<p>Now most churches don't have <em>that</em> problem, if for no other reason than the IRS tends to catch on to that kind of dodge pretty quickly. But there are <em>definitely</em> ways that churches--innocently or otherwise--can get into trouble here that have <em>nothing</em> to do with religion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no surer way to end freedom of religion than to tax it. If your place of worship has to pay a fee to stay in service, that means you as a mass have to pay to support your religion. If you can't pay, you can't worship.</p>
<p>Not by religious doctrine, but by government mandate. You <em>have</em> to pay a certain amount of money.</p>
<p>Keep in mind governments tend to care for things that bring in more taxes, so bigger churches and bigger religions would be favored in developmental plans to prevent disruption of government income. This could be something as small as redirecting a highway so it goes through a neighborhood instead of a church or as large as adjusting policy to benefit one church more than another. The only requirement is that the government doesn't discriminate between religions. I may be completely wrong, but it seems to me that it can still discriminate between churches of the same religion.</p>
