		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the 4s orbital is typically lower energy (and therefore filled first) in comparison to the 3d because a small part of it is actually quite close to the nucleus, whereas the 3d is generally mostly far out. We describe this by saying the 4s &quot;penetrates&quot; the 3d orbital.</p>
<p>Most teachers in high school are under the misunderstanding that all s-orbitals are simple spheres. They aren't. The 1s is, but the 2s is more of a sphere within another sphere. Then the 3s is a sphere within a sphere within a sphere, and so on. Gaps between these spheres called radial nodes are added every higher shell. This happens for all orbital types: one higher shell adds a radial node to that subshell's orbitals.</p>
<p>The 4s shell has 3 radial nodes, and it's innermost sphere is close to the nucleus. The 3d, because it is the first shell to have d orbitals, has no radial node. The electron density is mostly out at the edges, and this allows the 4s to actually achieve lower energy than 3d.</p>
<p>4s therefore fills first.</p>
<p>If you're wondering about chromium being 4s^1 3d^5 instead of 4s^2 3d^4, it's because the energy required to pair two electrons in the same orbital (causing repulsion due to the two negative charges on the electrons) turns out to actually be a greater energy cost than just... having the electron go into the higher energy 3d state.</p>
<p>Copper has a related story, in that it chooses to pair the last electron in the 3d rather than the 4s. this is again because of the shape of the orbitals - that small inner sphere of the 4s that's close to the nucleus also means paired electrons will be forced closer together than paired electrons in the 3d (which spend their time on the outskirts of the orbital) and so pairing in the 3d is more stable than pairing in the 4s. At least once the other 3d electrons are near full anyway. Orbital energies all differ and change depending on the electrons present in the atom already.</p>
<p>These trends generally hold down the table, but as you get more shells, the energies become very very similar for different orbitals and the electrons stop caring what order they fill really. Because the energy is about the same.</p>
<p>As to why the d block and f block specifically misbehave more than the others, it's because their shapes  siffer to that of the s and p orbitals. s and p orbitals only experience shielding from orbitals in shells lower down, but a d orbital is so spread out that it gets shielded by other electrons in the same shell. With f orbitals that effect gets so bad you even start seeing something called lanthanide contraction, where the atomic radius seems to behave as if the f orbital electrons are barely even there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically there are competing effects that determine the most stable electron configuration that lead to a very predictable and regular order early in the periodic table (small atomic numbers) but become more complicated with both increasing energy level and angular momentum.</p>
<p>At first, the largest effect leading to the aufbau rules is the energy level (labeled 1, 2, 3...) or the principal quantum level - which can be thought of as roughly the average distance from the nucleus. The difference in energy between levels decreases rapidly with increasing energy level so other effects start to compete</p>
<p>The next aufbau rule - fill s before p before d... relates the angular momentum (s orbitals have no angular momentum, p orbital have one quantum, d orbitals have 2...). In a single electron system (H atom or highly charged ions) they are all equally stable for a given energy level, but with the electron-electron repulsion, multi-electron systems tend to have the lower energy arrangements when the outermost electrons fill s orbitals first, then p, then d... the difference in these energies also reduces with increases angular momentum, and also varies with how many electrons.</p>
<p>Then there are effects like Hund's rule - configurations with unpaired electrons are more stable than those with paired electrons. This typically isn't considered when following the aufbau rules but is cited as the reason Chromium, for example, is [Ar]4s^1 3d^5 instead of [Ar]4s^2 3d^4 as predicted by Aufbau.</p>
<p>These kinds of breakdowns of the Aufbau principle become more common with higher energy level and higher angular momentum, and they do so in a manner that you really couldn't predict ahead of time based on simple arguments about energy sorting - you can only rationalize after the fact. It's not that these concepts are B.S., they just become too similar in magnitude to keep sorting in a simple predictable pattern. To truly predict an electron configuration for a large atom, you have to do a full quantum calculation solving the Shcroedinger equation - way beyond what you could do by hand and can even pretty challenging with high-speed computers for the larger atoms. </p>
<p>tl;dr: Like just about everything you think you know in science, the simple rules are approximations and sometimes the approximations aren't sufficient to answer your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what drove me nuts about chemistry and resulted in me dropping ChemE as a major. After learning more about quantum physics, I realize, the truth is that there is no analog for things that exist at the macroscopic level. The best we can do is describe the behaviors mathematically. Orbital theory is as close as you're going to get for an explanation. Otherwise, the answer is &quot;quantum physics&quot; which is a somewhat different reality we don't experience in every day life. At least, that's how I've been able to rationalize it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what my esteemed friends and colleagues here have said, all d-block (transition metals) have different and varying amounts of electrons in their outer shell, it's this outer shall that does most of the chemistry for that atom. In the case of a transition metal there are 5 outer orbitals, with different planes of movement and bonding so you can get large complexes or structures to form. All electrons are able to be spin-paired. This means that in the 5 d-orbitals 10 electrons may fit. Where in the case of scandium there is 1 d electron (sort of) and in zinc there are 10. Different elements within this series form different oxidation states, mostly always forming positive ions. The stability of certain metals and their use in different things is often to do with their oxidation state and therefore their d electron count. One of the best things I can say here is that metals love doing shit and making shit. </p>
<p>Part of this is to do with the fact that they are slap bang in the middle. They want to achieve a stable electronic configuration (e18) like a noble gas, for example your reason krypton doesn't easily react is due to it having a full set of valence electrons so it doesn't have to gain any or lose any to be more stable and therefore doesn't NEED to react. </p>
<p>P-block elements or main group elements (gallium-krypton) get involved in chemistry just as much more often than not with metals themselves and are just as important to our everyday lives and are the basic building blocks of all organics, including yourself! P-block elements only have 3-orbitals so 6 electrons so can't form as many bonds or oxidation states, however a reason for the higher stability of the p-block is due to the electronegativity of this group the closer to the element fluorine you go the more electronegative the species. P-block will often form negative ionic species and are limited to the amount of electrons they can gain before becoming too unstable. Another main reason for the stability is that the ionisation energy of all elements increases as you go across the period. So it takes more energy to play with these chemicals the further to the right you go. </p>
<p>Metals and d-block Chem is extremely cool and I love it! I'd be happy to try and answer any questions you may have! I hope this went some way to explain the basics of it? And of course as to what I've said there are huge numbers of exceptions and we're learning new things all the time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
