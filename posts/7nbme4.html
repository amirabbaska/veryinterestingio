		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question got me curious, and there wasn't much I could find but I could not imagine there aren't some consistent trends in differential molecular oxygen quantity and/or concentration in the troposphere despite all of the mixing, no matter how minute. I was, however, able to find <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mdmccar/migrated/ocea213/readings/08_oxygen/petsch_TOG_8.11_The_Global_O_Cycle.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> chapter from <em>Biogeochemistry</em> edited by William H Schlesinger which contains this pertinent excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 21% O₂ in the atmosphere represents an average composition. In spite of well-developed turbulent mixing in the lower atmosphere, seasonal latitudinal variations in O₂ concentration of ±15 ppm have been recorded. These seasonal variations are most pronounced at high latitudes, where seasonal cycles of primary production and respiration are strongest (Keeling and Shertz, 1992). In the northern hemisphere, the seasonal variations are anticorrelated with atmospheric <em>p</em>CO₂; summers are dominated by high O₂ (and high inferred net photosynthesis), while winters are dominated by lower O₂. In addition, there has been a measurable long-term decline in atmospheric O₂ concentration of ~10¹⁴ mol yr⁻¹, attributed to oxidation of fossil fuels. This decrease has been detected in both long-term atmospheric monitoring stations (Keeling and Shertz, 1992, Figure 1(a)) and in atmospheric gases trapped in Antarctic firn ice bubbles (Figure 1(b)). The polar ice core records extend the range of direct monitoring of atmospheric composition to show that a decline in atmospheric O₂ linked to oxidation of fossil fuels has been occurring since the Industrial Revolution (Bender <em>et al</em>., 1994b; Battle <em>et al</em>., 1996).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The differences are so tiny that they're difficult to measure.</p>
<p>One way to estimate it: Oxygen (O2) is mostly removed by combustion and respiration to form carbon dioxide (CO2), and is created by photosynthesis <em>from</em> CO2.  So to a rough approximation, every time we create or destroy a molecule of CO2, we destroy or create a molecule of O2.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/oco2/pia18934" target="_blank">satellite map</a> of CO2 variations across the world: they vary by about 15 parts per million -- that's .0015 percent -- from place to place.  Overall average CO2 level is about 390 ppm, so these variations are small but detectable.  From the argument above, that means that O2 should also vary by about the same amount ... but there's <em>so</em> much more oxygen, making up on average 20.946%, that the .0015% is tiny by comparison.</p>
<p>So from place to place, we'd expect that oxygen concentration should vary from a low of 20.945% to a high of 20.948%.  Basically not gonna make any difference, and almost impossible to even measure.</p>
<p>.* Experts note: this is a rough estimate only, and doesn't factor in stuff like molar vs mass concentration, formation of CO and other compunds, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read that there are low oxygen conditions in deep ocean areas, wetlands, at the bottom of lakes, bogs and permafrost, where carbon compounds from plants and animals don't oxidize all the way to CO2 and become methane. I have also heard about low oxygen conditions killing fish where a lot of algae growth in bodies of water (from fertilizer runoff for example) uses up available oxygen at the bottom of the water body in the decay process.</p>
<p>From Hubbert's Peak by Kenneth S Deffeyes (geologist, Princeton, Shell Oil) p- 24-5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jorge [Sarmiento] pointed out two different ways that the Eastern Mediterranean Sea could exchange water with the rest of the ocean. One had surface water coming in and deeper water going out the other was just reversed, deep water in and surface water out. Since organisms strip nutrients  into the deep water, circulation of surface water in and deep water out turns the ocean locally into a nutrient desert. Snorkelers and divers love nutrient deserts; the water is clear blue, and the bottom is visible 60 feet down.</p>
<p>The alternative, with deep water coming in and surface water going out, traps nutrients. Some dissolved nutrients come in with the deep water, but almost no nutrients leave with the surface water. As the nutrients build up, the Eastern Mediterranean turned into a highly fertilized garden. The abundant rain of dead bodies and fecal pellets from the surface overwhelmed the limited oxygen content of the bottom water. Organic rich sapropels were deposited. At this point I was wide awake. This is the source of the world's oil.&quot;</p>
