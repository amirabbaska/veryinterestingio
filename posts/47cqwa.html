		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most dramatic nebula images you generally see are those of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1146.html" target="_blank">molecular clouds</a>. These are star forming regions, which will form stars and planets. However, much of the gas is dissipated within 10s of millions of years by the radiation and winds from big bright short-lived stars, which is barely enough time to maybe have some planets form.</p>
<p>But, in principle, there's no reason why a planet couldn't coincidentally happen to be near a molecular cloud, or even another nebula like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula" target="_blank">planetary nebula</a>.</p>
<p>However, the view will not be all that impressive. Nebulae are very thin and dim, and are only really visible because we use telescopes with very large collecting areas and very long exposure times. To a human eye, a nebula is just a faint grey-white cloud. It might look cool from a very dark area on Earth with excellent visibility, but from a town it would just look like the stars are a little bit dimmer than they would be otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a simple rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Consider an extended object, like a gas cloud. It takes up some amount of <em>surface area</em> in your sky. Now move twice as far away from it. The same patch of nebula now seems 1/4 as bright, but also has 1/4 the surface area in the sky it had before. Therefore, the <em>surface brightness in the sky</em> of extended objects is actually constant with distance. The reason they appear dimmer with more distance is simply because they take up less area in the sky (i.e. appear smaller).</p>
<p>So find a nebula in the sky, with your <em>unaided eyes</em>. Imagine that the whole sky has the same brightness as that small patch which is the nebula. Voila, that's your answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not satisfied with the other answers here.  According to <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_7/notes31.html" target="_blank">Barbara Ryden</a>, author of <em>Interstellar and Galactic Medium</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Within a parsec or so of the center, the density of stars is 10 million stars per cubic parsec. To put this number in perspective, the density of stars in the Sun's neighborhood is only 0.2 stars per cubic parsec. Near the center of our galaxy, the average distance between neighboring stars is only 1000 A.U. If the star Sirius were only 1000 A.U. from the Sun, it would be twelve times brighter than the full moon. If we lived close to the galactic center, the night sky would be full of stars with extremely high apparent brightness. We would be able to read by starlight at night.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is plenty of dust near the galactic center, and with a star density 50 million times greater than our own (with a night sky containing a million stars as bright as Sirius) I'd imagine nebulae would light up pretty well! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some nebulae are extremely bright-- consider the object <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_Nebula" target="_blank">30 Doradus</a>, a very large star-forming nebula also called the Tarantula Nebula. It's 160,000 light years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud. <a href="http://www.noao.edu/news/2011/pr1102.php" target="_blank">A press release from NOAO</a> claims that if it were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula (1,344 LY away) it would cover an area of the sky 60 times that of the moon and it would be bright enough to cast shadows discernible to the human eye.</p>
<p>However, the apparent intensity of a light source remains the same regardless of the angular size of the object--for example, if you take a two pictures of a bare light bulb at different distances, the exposure is the same, requiring the same combination of ISO, shutter speed and aperture, regardless of if you're taking the picture from across the room or right next to the light bulb. So even though the nebula might be bright enough to illuminate the surface of the Earth at night from that relatively close distance, no part of the nebula would actually appear brighter in and of itself than it does as we see it from Earth now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes.</p>
<p>In practice, I wouldn't want to live there.</p>
<p>We can see some nebula with our naked eyes--Orion's <del>Belt</del> sword, the Pleides, and a few others in the &quot;equator&quot; of the sky come to mind. They appear as stars or as dusty smudges and don't provide an awful lot of light in human terms, but you can see them without assistance.</p>
<p>To be near enough one for it to make a glow in the sense of useful light on a human scale we would almost certainly be close enough that other stars in or near the nebula would provide so much light as to all but wash out the light from the nebula. It would probably end up looking something like driving at night in a snow storm, except on a planetary scale--the planet is driving at night in a snow storm :). No usable light on the ground (you couldn't navigate by the light I don't think) but the sky might have a sort of twilight glow everywhere the nebula is.</p>
<p>Chances are the star of the system would clear the system of dust through it's solar winds before the planet was habitable; so if you were on the planet while the dust cloud was still wrapping it? You'd almost certainly find the surface uninhabitable surrounded by deadly collision-bound objects and deadly dust clouds. [Edit: nebula are the birth places of stars and planets, lots of things coming into being that you wouldn't want to collide with and who's radiation might fry you).</p>
