		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Â I don't know exactly how much info y'all want, so I'll do a tl;dr at the end. </p>
<p>Brain signals that initiate muscle movement start in the cerebral cortex and move through the spinal cord to the muscles. While the nerve signals pass through this system ( specifically when they're in the medulla) they are molded by signals from the cerebellum. </p>
<p>So basically(generalizing here)  the cerebellum controls fine muscle movement.  Unfortunately, drinking alcohol increases <del>production</del> (correction: uptake) of GABA (a neurotransmitter which primarily has a sedative effect) in the brain.  When there is an overabundance of GABA, the cerebellum doesn't function properly, and causes jerky, shaky fine motor movement.  Your eyes are controlled by fine motor movement, and thus get the same effect.</p>
<p>This is also why you have a hard time touching your nose when you are drunk.</p>
<p>TL;DR
When you drink, the motor control center in your brain gets too much of a specific neurotransmitter, and does not function well.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:  the GABA inhibitor theory is only that, a theory.  Alcohol may very well affect the cerebellum via different mechanisms.  However, this is a widely accepted theory and is the best one we have right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horizontal nystagmus, your eyes involuntarily jutting back and forth, is usually associated with middle ear pathology. In your middle ear, there are semicircular canals that are filled with fluid and tiny crystals. The crystals floating up and down in the fluid signal head movement to your brain. When you drink enough alcohol, the specific gravity of the fluids in and out of this area changes, and causes that region to suggest to the rest of the body including your eyes, that you are moving when you are actually not. The eyes are moving back and forth to try to compensate. As a finer point of distinction, the eyes are typically not  simply oscillating back and forth, but they are straying in one direction and snapping back to center.  Interestingly,  as alcohol wears off, it is common to have nystagmus in the opposite direction for a period of time as the body continues to adjust. By this I mean nystagmus may be left to right and then as you sober up, it may go right to left. For what it's worth, vertical nystagmus, which typically does not occur with alcohol consumption, is usually associated with cerebellar pathology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simpler version.  That is a nystagmus test.  When drunk the eyes bounce horizontally to the light, especially when extended to the hard right or left.  If they bounce up to down that is an indication of PCP, I believe.  For what it is worth (FWIW), it was a nystagmus test that stooped me from ever drinking and driving again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put when intoxicated you have reduced reaction time with your muscles. This includes the muscles in your eyes. Normally you can hold your eyes to the side perfectly fine for a period of time. However, our eyes want to be looking forward because it's no strain on the muscle, like flexing vs relaxed. When not intoxicated it is not a problem to keep your eyes looking to the side for a while. However, when I intoxicated you move your eyes to the side and they want to move back to center as normal. But with the delayed reaction time your eyes begin to bounce back to center before you catch it and put it back to the side. This creates what appears to be a small vibrating effect known as nystagmus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to realize is that many of the assessments administered during the FST were created when the legal limit was much higher, and the science back then supporting their usefulness even at higher BALs ought to be considered questionable by today's standards.</p>
<p>So the answer is it may not be useful at all in almost all cases of roadside tests, and it's certainly not useful at BALs close to 0.08.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
