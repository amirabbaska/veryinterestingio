		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You and your friends gather around a table. You eat food, you drink drinks, and pretend to be characters in a fantasy world. Your very smartest friend is the &quot;DM&quot; because he or she wrote down some ideas for a story that you can all act out together. Your DM starts at the beginning of the story, and lets everyone at the table improvise the middle and end. Solving problems and fighting monsters a big part of moving the story along, but at this table you roll dice to decide if your character will be awesome or fail. Winning takes some lucky dice rolls, but if you play to your character's strengths, you'll get through it no problem. At the end of the story your character gets experience points and levels up. If you and your friends get to a higher level, you can solve more interesting problems and fight way bigger monsters. </p>
<p>Just like any other improv or board game, if everyone at the table WANTS TO have a good time, it's going to be a great time. Also you have to worship the devil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's imagine two characters; Bob the Barbarian and Will the Wizard. Bob is very strong and very tough, but not a very smart or sociable guy. Will is very smart and can do cool magic things, but is a frail fellow. You get to come up with a fun story for Bob and/or Will about why they're an adventurer/how they got to be so cool.</p>
<p>From there....you make up things as you go along a story, which is controlled by your DM, aka your &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;. Let's say his/her story has you confronting a troll who demands payment for you to cross his bridge.</p>
<p>Bob could try and fight the troll. He's good at fighting. His stats are great for fighting. Bob can also certainly try and write up a treaty between the nearby town and the troll to arrange free passage in a diplomatic trade agreement. Bob's not so good at that, but he's definitely able to try if he'd like, and Bob gets to be a hero either way.</p>
<p>Will might try using magic on the troll to pass by undetected, or he can use his clever wits to trick the troll in to letting them pass for free. Will can also attempt to arm wrestle the troll to let them pass; it may not work, but that's totally Will's call, and if he wins he still beat the bad guy.</p>
<p>That's D&amp;D in a nutshell. You come up with a character, create a fun backstory, and then just make up things based on what the DM is narrating to you. The DM is the world your characters live in. They're the narrator describing events as they unfold. They're the familiar tavern keeper welcoming you back in from the cold. They're the bad guy cursing you with his dying breath. You are active members in the story they create. You can literally do (almost) anything, as long as the dice go your way. There's a chance of success or failure in almost everything you do, only limited by your own creativity. Depending on what you wanna do, you add a certain modifier to your dice roll. The better you are at a certain skill, the higher the modifier, meaning the more likely it is that something using that modifier will succeed. </p>
<p>Depending on how you make your character, certain stats are more likely to succeed than others, so obviously you'll probably play it safe most of the time. </p>
<p>...But no one remembers that time the cleric THOUGHT about punching the troll in the dick so that she could intimidate it to let her friends pass, and then decided to pray to their god to make the troll go away. They remember the time Christina the Cleric kicked a troll so hard in the nads it passed out from the pain. </p>
<p>Moments like that are what make D&amp;D amazing, and I hope you and your friend have a great time playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies in advance I am on mobile:</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game. </p>
<p>The game is structured by rulebooks that describe mechanics, detailing how to decide if a particular action has the desired result or not (&quot;I want to jump over this big pit! For example). </p>
<p>Because these actions are usually more complicated than simple success or failure (continuing our our example: you may fall short of the other side of the pit but just barely manage to catch the ledge, hanging on for dear life!) there exists the role of The Dungeon Master (DM). The DMs influence and control of the game can vary from person to person. The typical experienced DM will act as the arbitrator, will keep the flow of the story going, will act and play as all the characters aside from the players (shopkeepers, monsters, quest givers), and will also act as the environment (traps, dungeons, weather, dues ex machina). A DM may write their own story and monsters and dungeons, or use premade material.    </p>
<p>Edit:
The core mechanic of DnD is as follows:
For any action with a chance of failure roll a twenty sided die (called a d20). The DM instructs the player to add the relevant numbers from the players character sheet. Compare the result against a pre-determined 'dice check' number (called a DC). </p>
<p>Putting it all together: </p>
<p>DM: you are in a dark cave. The door to the treasure is on the far side of the room, illuminated dimly by light seepung through the cracks in the frame. A large pit, 15ft across, blocks your path</p>
<p>Player character (PC): I get a good running start and leap across the pit!</p>
<p>DM: ok roll an Athletics Check. Remember, that's d20 plus your strength and also plus any training you may have in athletics. (The DM knows from the rulebook the DC for this check is DC 15)</p>
<p>PC: ok! I rolled a 7, plus my 3 strength bonus and 4 from my training. I got 14!</p>
<p>DM: You dash towards tje pit and make a mighty leap! Soaring through the near total darkness you realize you aren't going to make it! If you are quick and lucky you may be able to grab on to the ledge and avoid a fall. Roll a dexterity saving throw. that's a d20 plus dexterity plus training.</p>
<p>PC: I got a 19!</p>
<p>DM: you barely manage to grab the ledge and haul yourself over the side. Lucky save!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>D&amp;D is a game, and First and foremost it should be fun. It is also a game with a lot of rules. How many of them you choose to follow depends on who's running the game, and at it's core the game is very flexible. There are a common set of generally agreed upon rules you'll find at every table, how much damage weapons do, how movement works, how casting spells work. You want to learn the rules for whatever flavor of D&amp;D you choose.</p>
<p>Pathfinder is free and available online and the getting started section applied to most D&amp;D type games: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html</a></p>
<p>D&amp;D version 5e can be googled: d&amp;d 5e player's handbook pdf you can view the basic rules for free (TIL): <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules</a></p>
<p>Reading the first few section of either handbook will get you acquainted with the general way the game works. After that there are lots and lots of details. Pathfinder has a nice beginners box which simplies a LOT of the rules, but lets you get a good feel for how the game plays. If you choose to teach yourself and your friend, and you won't be joining an experienced table I highly recommend you start with this: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox</a></p>
<p>It will primarily allow you to PLAY the game instead of spending hours learning rules.</p>
<p>Once you have the general stuff like &quot;how do I hit things&quot; and &quot;how do I move around&quot; you'll want to decide what &quot;game&quot; you want to play. do you want to create your own world? author your own story? If so, the world is your oyster. You can craft a fantastical story and have your friend play through it with you. This is a very traditional approach, but it puts a lot of burden on the Game Master to create a story. If that's not your style there are TONS of already written Adventures for both D&amp;D 5e and pathfinder. You basically get to play through an RPG story. This is great if nobody you know is a good author, and will make some of the stuff easier to understand since monster stat blocks and things will be easier to understand.</p>
<p>After you get a feel for the rules and how it generally works, there are tons and tons of digital tabletop ways to play with people online. And lots of local game-stores host their own game nights, pathfinder has the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society</a> which is a way to very much play Pathfinder like an RPG. I found it to be a great place to try different characters without having to commit to a full campaign. At the time when I played PFS I played a &quot;home game&quot; with friends with a long running story, and I would play a couple PFS games every month to try out different character classes etc. It was really fun. If you're looking to play D&amp;D like a MMO or RPG, PFS will give you a similar experience. If you are looking to play a huge fantastical story of your own creation, you probably want to read the rules and craft your own world. If you want something in between, checkout the pathfinder adventure paths or campaign settings.</p>
<p>I have only played d&amp;d 2, 3.5, and pathfinder. I have friends who've played 5e and claim it's simplier and easier to approach, but I don't know all the resources to dive into 5e. There are subreddits for each of these games though, with lots of info.</p>
<p>e: added link to basic rules for 5e</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My real advice would be to see if there's a group or club near you who would be happy to play with some newbies. There should be some people who are happy to run a game for you, or let you join a campaign. Look on facebook for groups in your nearest reasonably sized town.</p>
<p>However, the basic explanation:</p>
<p>You have a Dungeon Master (DM for short) who sets up a basic setting for a story. Some locations, characters, monsters and so on, and find some way to give the players a quest. This can be simple, for example, a major local figure has recruited you to go to a specific place and find a magic gem, or something. </p>
<p>The players create characters, with certain skills and abilities. The players say what they want to do. The DM decides whether to just let them do it, or whether they need to roll dice for it. The skills and abilities tend to add a number to the roll. </p>
<p>An important thing to understand is that the DM is running the game. He is not trying to defeat the players (that would be easy - rocks fall, everyone dies) but to create an interesting challenge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
