		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. Or rather: the abstract definition of charge flowing from the positive electrode to the negative is inaccurate.</p>
<p>In reality, a current can consist of a various species of particles: electrons, positive ions, negative ions. Since electrons are by far the lightest, in most situations the current is mostly determined by the flow of electrons. In a regular metal wire, the ions are part of the metal and are thus fixed, while electrons can move freely, but from negative to positive, opposite to the direction of the reference current. However, in a semiconductor material, current is carried by both positive and negative charges.</p>
<p>The convention that current flows from positive to negative is an arbitrary choice. You could easily define it the other way around and nothing would change. For historical reasons, we use positive-to-negative and while in many cases the dominant flow of charge carriers is in the opposite direction, it's not really worth the hassle to change the definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The convention was set by <a href="http://practicalphysics.org/electric-charge-and-current-short-history.html" target="_blank">Benjamin Franklin</a>; because of the methods he used, it seemed intuitive to him to assign &quot;positive&quot; charge to be what is actually an <em>absence</em> of electrons. By the time anyone understood electricity well enough to realize the convention was backwards, it was <a href="https://xkcd.com/567/" target="_blank">entirely too late</a>. Fortunately, it doesn't really affect the math. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply history and fact it does not matter which direction current flows, the maths works either way until you get into semiconductor theory. Even then, assuming holes move instead of electrons still works.
In many cases, like batterys, it happens both ways with ion transport.
Ben Franklin came up with the direction and was another century before electrons were discovered, so it became 'convention', hence conventional current flow vs electron flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about electric current, we're talking about the flow of electrons. Since those are negatively charged, they're attracted to positive charges. A positive charge is basically just a place with missing electrons. The electrons want to go fill those empty spaces.</p>
<p>Think of a row of chairs filled with people, except for one seat on the end. We'll pretend that the seats closer to that end are &quot;better,&quot; so people want to sit there. The person next to the empty seat moves over, creating a new empty seat where that person was. So now the person next to the new empty seat moves over. This keeps happening down the row. If you were looking at the row from a distance, it would look like there were an empty seat traveling down the row of people. This is what an &quot;electron hole&quot; looks like in a flow of current. It's easier to track the hole moving from positive to negative than it is to track all the electrons moving from negative to positive.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Charges always flow to the path of least resistance or to the lowest potential difference. This doesn't mean positive to negative. In nature, the Electric Field of a positive point charge points outward and that of a negative point charge points inward. </p>
<p>Scenario 1:  When you put two oppositely charged point charges of equal magnitude closely next to one another there will be a Lorentz Force exerted pulling them together that is proportional to the charge size times the net Electric field.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: You have two metal plates close together with a copper wire attaching them to each other on their backside to make a circuit. The plates are oppositely charged and the positive plate has 2x the charge as the negative plate. The net Electric field will point towards the negative plate. This force will polarize the loose electrons of the copper wire as the built up charged ions in between the plates flow in this direction around the wire. This effectively is a capacitor discharging. Most batteries are designed with ions flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, hence why people say current flows from positive to negative.</p>
