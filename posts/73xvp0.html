		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the people speaking the dialect have sufficient power and/or influence to get people to accept that it is. That's it. Two language can be very similar and mutually easily intelligible but if there are two governments that have the authority to say they are different languages, then they're considered two different languages. As I have been told is the case with Serbian and Croatian (I don't speak either so I'm just going by what I was told by someone who lived in the area). On the other hand, there's Arabic. I'm told that what is spoken in Lebanon is so different from what is spoken in Saudi Arabia that they're not mutually intelligible... but they're both considered to be Arabic because there's a purposefulness to keep calling them the same language. Yet at the same time these are all different countries so there's no cohesive movement to pick a standard version of the language so the different regions start speaking the same version. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll agree with what everybody else is saying about political/social pressure being a key factor as languages seem to exist on a continuum. Also, I'd like to share that I've been exposed to an English language varient that I'd like to think of as being pretty darn close to being another language, that's Jamaican Patois. I grew up speaking it but because the social capital is in the mesolect (standard English) I was told as a child that we're English speakers and it was a sign of being poor/uneducated/rural to &quot;chat Patois&quot;.</p>
<p>Once I was older I realise how different that dialect is from standard English, trying to explain to a standard English speaker words in Jamaican music like &quot;unnu&quot; or  &quot;dehso/yahso&quot; or a word like &quot;nyam&quot; which I can translate but has more implications than just eat or devour.  I was like damn, this isn't just an accent like I was told by older folks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The classic response to this is &quot;When it has its own army and navy.&quot;</p>
<p>There's a thing called the Dialect Continuum, where dialects A and B can communicate, and B and C can communicate, but A and C cannot.</p>
<p>So it seems to A and C as though they're speaking different languages. Are they?</p>
<p>There are places in Europe where you can drive three hundred miles, cross a couple of borders, and everyone agrees you're now in a different country with a different language.</p>
<p>But you could take someone from certain neighborhoods in Boston and drop them into certain neighborhoods in Louisiana and they would not be able to understand each other. Even though they are ostensibly speaking English.</p>
<p>(In reality they WOULD be able to understand each other because they would each immediately shift dialects to the English everyone hears on the TV, but the point stands).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Quebec and France both speak &quot;French&quot;, but a lot of people from France can't understand Quebecois even though Quebecois understand the French.</p>
<p>A few years ago Quebec released a movie about an Olympic swimmer that drops blown up condoms on public events called &quot;a vos marques party!&quot; ( Play on words for &quot;a vos marques partez!&quot; Or translated it's &quot;on your marks, get set, party!&quot;)</p>
<p>When it was filmed in French in Quebec, but it was dubbed in Parisian french before being released in France so people could understand it.</p>
<p>It pissed off a lot of hardcore Quebecois because they feel that quebc speaks French.</p>
<p>Despite this, and despite having a lot of differences ( Quebec says &quot;char&quot; french say &quot;bagnole&quot; ), people still say it's the same language.</p>
<p>I think Quebecois and french are on the tipping point before it becomes a separate language</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really have a good definition of this. There are languages that are very similar, but are considered different languages (Spanish speakers might be able to understand Galician and Catalan, and even communicate pretty well, but they're all different languages). On the other hand, we have languages with different dialects that two people speaking them won't be able to understand each other. This is true for Northern and Southern Italian, French from different regions, and Chinese especially. Just because you speak one of them, doesn't mean you'll understand all of them. And there are so many Chinese people that finding people in your region that speak your dialect, and having it evolve independently of the others is very easy.</p>
<p>So in conclusion: governments get to pick and label them. But there isn't very clear definitions of either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
