<p>I'd assume there are a infinite amount of numbers and maybe even rational numbers. I'm more interested in integers.  </p>
<p>From what I've seen, it works when b = a (aka a^a = a^(a)), but that's a trivial solution. The only non trivial solution I found was 2^4 = 4^2.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we have a^(b)=b^(a), then taking logs and rearranging gives log(a)/a=log(b)/b. So if we look at the function f(x)=log(x)/x, then we'll want to find two different values x=a and x=b so that f(a)=f(b). If f(a)=f(b), then we can just work backwards to a^(b)=b^(a). </p>
<p>So what does f(x) look like? Well, it's negative for 0&lt;x<1 and positive for all x>1. Furthermore, looking at it's derivative, you can find that it is increasing when 0&lt;x<e and decreasing when x>e. And, finally, the limit of f(x) at x=infinity is zero. So, f(x) is increasing whenever it is negative and this means that it never repeats a negative value, since it is only going up when it <em>is</em> negative, and once it's positive it's never negative again. So we can't have f(a)=f(b) when either a&lt;1 or b&lt;1. But, since it is increasing from x=1 to x=e, and f(1)=0, and it is decreasing from x=e onward, and f(x)-&gt;0 as x-&gt;infinity, it follows that for any 1&lt;a&lt;e, there is exactly one b&gt;e so that f(a)=f(b). So there are infinitely many solutions to this.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/d4AGJsy.png" target="_blank">Here is a plot of how this works</a></p>
<p>Note that 2 is the only integer between 1 and e, so a=2 and b=4 is the only nontrivial integer solution.</p>
<p>We can actually parameterize all of our solutions. In particular, if r is any real number, then maybe we can find an 1&lt;a&lt;e so that b=a^(r) gives us a solution? Plugging b=a^(r) into log(a)/a=log(b)/b and rearranging things, gives a=r^(1/[r-1]) so we'll have b=r^(r/[r-1]). Since any 1&lt;a&lt;e can be written as  a=r^(1/[r-1]) for <em>some</em> real number r&gt;1, this means that every solution looks like this. So, pick  any r&gt;1 and</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a=r^(1/[r-1]) </p>
</li>
<li>b=r^(r/[r-1])</li>
</ul>
<p>will be a solution to the equation a^(b)=b^(a).</p>
<p>But what about rational solutions? If there's no guarantee that when x=a is rational that the corresponding x=b will also be rational. When does this happen? It turns out that it will happen infinitely often. In particular, if n is any positive integer, then</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a = (1+1/n)^(n)</p>
</li>
<li>b = (1+1/n)^(n+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>will work. This works by making r an rational number so that 1/(1-r) and r/(1-r) are integers, and plugging it into our formula. In particular, picking r=1+1/n works. The first few rational solutions are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a=2, b=4,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a=9/4, b=27/8</p>
</li>
<li>a=64/27, b=256/81</li>
</ul>
<p>To see why this form provides <em>all</em> the rational solutions requires some work, but it isn't too difficult, see <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~reznick/xyyx.pdf" target="_blank">this article</a> for details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yfpe9shyrw" target="_blank">plot</a> x^y = y^(x), we see that the graph has two pieces: a straight piece and a curved piece that intersect at the point (e,e).</p>
<p>The straight piece is just y=x; this corresponds to the trivial solutions.</p>
<p>The curved piece is given by y = -W(-log(x)/x) <em> x / log(x), where W is the principal branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function" target="_blank">Lambert W function</a>.
