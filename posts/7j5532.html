		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know very little about this topic, but I was interested and thought I might be able to find it myself.</p>
<p>So, attempting to find a graph of the efficacy of the flu vaccine after injection was very difficult. However, I did find <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank">this</a> page regarding the flu vaccine wherein it states that the antibodies build up over a period of two weeks.</p>
<p>From there, it was actually pretty easy to find a graph of the antibodies and how they build up over time, seen <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnBf2.png" target="_blank">here</a>. But the reason why I'm posting is to direct you to <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42977/why-does-immunity-from-the-flu-vaccine-appear-only-after-two-weeks" target="_blank">this</a> stackexchange post. It should go into more detail than I can!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although antibody titer is helpful in gauging the response to an ongoing infection, that has nothing to do with the efficacy of the vaccine against future infections. Antibodies to the flu vaccine are produced by plasma B cells, which are proliferating and producing the antibody according to the graph that the other commentator posted. Technically, if you got infected by the real flu once those antibodies are at maximum, your body will probably fight it off instantly. You might not even know you ever got infected.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t get infected by the flu in that short time frame, your antibody titer will drop off dramatically, probably within a week or two (although I’m not sure how fast this drop off actual is). After that, it’s up to a different type of B cell, memory B cells, to respond to an infection. These respond much faster than the initial response and will differentiate and multiply into plasma cells to produce the antibody again.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, you’re not looking for the time in which it takes for antibodies to form in response to an infection, but the time for a sufficiently large population of memory B cells to form. Since both responses begin at the same time, the timeframe might be (but isn’t necessarily) the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The graph you are requesting would be more simple to draw if having the flu could be defined as a simple yes no question. That is hardly the case however, since you could have a subclinical flu, or you could have flu with a wide range of severely in symptoms. I think you will have more luck if you regard the problem as a question of antibody titers, preferable IgG antibody titer. I think information should be available for average antibody titer at different time points after infection. Although [this] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22064268" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22064268</a>) is not what you are looking for, it is related and should give you an idea of how the question can be addressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the inactivated flu vaccine protects you from matched strains starting about a week to two weeks after administration and lasts up to about 2-3 months before the effect wanes. The effectiveness that I think you are referring to occurs at the population scale, where the proportion of cases prevented by the vaccine can be estimated based on vaccine use, strain matching, and confirmed influenza cases. So, if the vaccine is said to be “10% effective” then 10% of total influenza cases predicted based on epidemiological data were prevented by vaccine use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
