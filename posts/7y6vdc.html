		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fighting has a long tradition in hockey. As long as certain rules are followed the refs let the fight go until one player is knocked down. Then both players get a 5 minute penalty. It's mostly used as a way to blow off steam due to some slight or foul play (like consistently blindsiding players when checking them) and the fight is the consequence. So, yes, fighting is accepted in hockey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fighting in today's nhl is most often (though not always) done when a player from team A hits a player from team B and team B deems the hit to be dirty. If thats the case a player from team B will engage the hitter from team A in fisticuffs. Players have long memories and sometimes players will fight days, weeks or months after a dirty hit or play. </p>
<p>If the refs can step in safely and separate the players they sometimes will do that, but if the fight is underway they generally wait until one player is either knocked down or in an unsafe position. Sometimes fights go on for a while and if both players are exhausted they will step in. </p>
<p>Both players receive 5 minute penalties, and if there is a clear instigator, that player will receive an additional 2 minute penalty.</p>
<p>Fighting has decreased in recent years, and teams rarely roster a player who is a tough guy and a tough guy only. Most tough guys need to have some level of skill, and those who don't are generally out of the nhl quickly.</p>
<p>Right now it is an integral part of the game, but it wouldn't surprise me if the day comes when it rarely happens. Ex-enforcers have been found to have CTE and in recent years there has been a string of deaths and suicides by former nhl tough guys.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_\(ice_hockey\)" target="_blank">enforcers</a> do.</p>
<p>Generally the fighting is done in retaliation to rough treatment of a star player.  If a high scorer is banged up a bit, the team's &quot;enforcer&quot; will come on the ice to pick a fight with and punish the opposing player who did it.  The enforcer isn't there to score goals, he's there to instill respect for his team's good players.</p>
<p>To take nothing away from his skills, this is why Wayne Gretzky (a pretty small guy) benefited tremendously by playing alongside gigantic bruisers like Marty McSorley.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's part of the game and culture. It is an intensely physical sport with lots of contact and danger (big guys, high speed, sharp blades, hard surfaces, sticks swinging, heavy puck flying) so you can't be afraid of getting hurt. </p>
<p>Teams will usually have what they call an Enforcer who usually takes on the opponent's Enforcer to try and swing the momentum of the game. Other times, someone will make a dirty or unsportsmanlike hit on another player and need to be put in their place. </p>
<p>It's just accepted that fighting plays a role in the sport and culture of hockey, but there is etiquette. More often than not, the fighting players agree to fight before the puck drops and everyone knows it, the refs included. Once someone puts a knee down or falls, the fight is over. </p>
<p>YouTube some hockey fight compilations and you'll see what I mean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
