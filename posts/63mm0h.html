		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Portable chargers and phones are not directly connected batteries. The portable charger has a boost converter, that takes the voltage (between 3 and 4v) from the internal battery(ies), oscillates it to create an alternating current that can be boosted in voltage using a coil, capacitor or both, and then it gets rectified back to DC at 5v (USB standard).</p>
<p>(edit: in a discussion below, I'm corrected: the current is not alternating, is in fact pulsating DC. And therefore doesn't get rectified to 5v, it gets smoothed to reduce ripple) </p>
<p>The phone, on the other side, takes the 5v from the USB input and steps it down to the required voltage to charge the internal phone battery. That varies according to the technology of the battery, the charge remaining in it, the charge speed the phone wants, and so on.</p>
<p>When you connect two batteries directly, yes, they more or less reach an equilibrium, because as the most charged one (higher voltage) recharges the empty one, its voltage decreases as the other one's increases. When there is not enough difference of potential (voltage, in other words) to make the charge flow from one battery to another, they reach the equilibrium.</p>
<p>In the portable chargers, the boost circuitry makes sure the output voltage is 5v as long as possible, of course by drawing more current from the lower voltage internal cells, because in both sides of the conversion circuit the power should be almost equal [ P = I * V ] (ignoring losses in the conversion). So the charger extracts more current from cells to generate those 5v the phone needs, and the phone as long as it haves the right voltage, can charge the internal battery, so eliminating the &quot;equilibrium&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people can give a more detailed and strict answer, but this is the way I get it.</p>
<p>PD: sorry for any mistakes, english is not my main language. Regards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always find it easy to think of electricity like water. In this situation you have two pools, the portable charger and the phone battery. If your phone pool is low then the circuit board in the charger acts like a pump that takes water out of the charger pool and pumps it into the phone pool. This allows it to take all of the water out of the charger pool and put it in your phone pool. This fills up your phone pool even to the point of being fuller than the charger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of circuitry between the batteries that makes it all work.</p>
<p>As for the charged device, it's (most commonly) provided with 5V DC, whilst the battery tops out at 4.2V. There's charge-regulators between the 5V and the battery that makes sure charging stops when the battery is full.</p>
<p>As for the portable battery charger. Let's assume (for simplicitys sake) that it's a small one. It'll contain one Li-Ion battery that'll have 4.2V when fully charged, and 2.8V when it's practically dead.</p>
<p>Now, to charge the other device, it'll need to provide 5V. It does this through a &quot;DC-DC Boost converter&quot; which increases the voltage provided by the battery to 5V.</p>
<p>Now, this is not some physics-breaking EE voodoo. It's all about energy. If your device wants 1A current at 5V to charge, and your portable battery chargers battery is at 3V, the boost-converter will draw 1.666A from its battery.  (  5 <em> 1 = 3 </em> 1.666 )</p>
<p>This is of course assuming 100% efficiency, which isn't attainable. Most well-designed boost-converters are above 90% efficient though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna try and simplify things a bit here. These portable batteries, as correctly described in the other posts, has some circuitry that allows it to charge your devices. But the part of that circuitry that actually prevents the current from flowing in both directions, is called a Schottky diode, or blocking diode. It's like a one-way check valve and will only allow current flow in one direction. </p>
<p>This is actually what keeps them from reaching &quot;equilibrium&quot;. Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a USB dock that would somehow drain the power from any devices (cell phones, tablets) to charge any batteries that were connected to it. </p>
<p>It seems like something that shouldn't be possible, but I'd plug a 50% phone and 10% battery only to end up with a dead phone and 50% charged battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
