<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2005/08/the_white_stuff.html" target="_blank">Slate did one that touches on it</a>. </p>
<p>I think the biggest point out of the articles that answers your question is that vanilla came to the U.S. most likely as an ice cream flavoring. It was prized in ice cream and other foods for both its scent and flavor, and because it was considered a delicate and exotic flavor/scent, it was used in moderation. Even today, vanilla ice cream made with real vanilla will be white, because vanilla is incredibly strong and the amount that lends a good level of flavor/scent is not nearly enough to color the otherwise white ice cream significantly. </p>
<p>This is pretty much exactly what /u/vadergeek and other commenters have said; I thought the articles lent an interesting background from both practical and social perspectives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vanilla beans are black, but vanilla extract is not really. It's more of a dark amber. When you add a few drops of that to a huge bucket of ice cream made of milk and sugar, it turns a little yellowish like French Vanilla ice cream. Using artificial vanilla flavoring instead of extract makes white ice cream because vanillin is a pure white powder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Likely because using vanilla as a flavoring does not alter the color of the food. Vanilla is so strog a flavor that not much is needed to flavor foods. Before vanilla extract was invented, a common way to flavor baked goods was through the use of vanilla sugar. To make vanilla sugar, a bean pod was stored in the barrel of sugar, and the sugar would take on the flavor of the vanilla pod. Even now, if real vanilla flavoring is being used, the extract is in such small quantities that at best it turns ice cream a pale yellow. Even if the bean itself is ground up and added, this just results in tiny black specs while not altering the color of the food itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume the flavoring is older than artificial coloring. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s</p>
<p>Lots of people are saying it was just used to flavor white foods and it's not a strong dye. Like most plants the bean starts is as green abs turns brown as it drys. </p>
<p>I know it is from an orchid originally found in Mexico. Then exported all over the world via the spice trade.</p>
<p>TIL: vanilla flowers are only open for about a day and are pollinated by hand. That's why it's the second most expensive spice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
