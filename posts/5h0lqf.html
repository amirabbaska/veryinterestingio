<p>But with the focus on &quot;fake news&quot; these days, I want to make sure I am open-minded and using all available critical thinking tools to make sure I am informed properly. </p>
<p>So explain to me like I'm five - and as a PSA for other people whose BS detectors aren't yet finely tuned - how you can tell that a news source is, in fact, credible.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at it as the credibility of a news item as well as the credibility of the news source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the news source is generally well respected, credibility of any news item goes up.  One indicator of general respectedness is whether it was around before the web, another indicator is whether there is a print edition (these are NOT exclusive, just indicators).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the news source is using language seeking to analyze and inform, rather than inflame or anger, credibility goes up (compare HuffPo and Breitbart to the Economist and WaPo, even to the National Review).  If you get really angry reading the article, or think someone on the other side might, credibility goes down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the news source is TV or cable, look elsewhere for confirmation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the news item is being reported by multiple sources which have some amount of respectability, credibility goes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the news item is not a breaking news item but something that has been discussed across a broad swath of media for a period of time, credibility goes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the news item's sources are well-documented and relatively credible themselves, credibility goes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the news item is about events or ideas rather than people's individual behavior, then credibility goes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that every news outlet is occasionally wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>Remember that every news outlet has its own kind of bias, which may or may not be obvious at the point when you consume the news.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reason: One of the best ways to be able to initially detect problems is by thinking. Does this even make sense? If you were in the position as whoever the article is about could you understand why they did it? Many times very biased news sources will try and paint whoever they are talking about as being &quot;for the evulz&quot; without any of the nuance of the issues surrounding them. </p>
<p>Nuance: For instance during the Iran deal did Obama push for it because he is a muslim who wants Islam to take over America? Or is it because the US doesn't want to get into a war with Iran and believes this is actually the best way forward to prevent Iran from getting a weapon and not trampling on their national pride? The more nuance that a source tends to have, the less likely they are actually trying to evoke a specific response and are therefore more likely to be actually informative.</p>
<p>Concensus: Generally speaking this is one of the weaker ones to use, however this is not to say it cannot be used. If there are multiple sources that are reporting the same thing it can GENERALLY be trusted (Iraq war being an infamous exception). Also, if the reporting is being split through party lines (IE Fox News and MSNBC saying the same thing) then most likely it is true. </p>
<p>Bias: Amusingly enough, you can definitely use the inherent bias of the sources you are using to verify veracity. For instance, if there is a Fox news anchor or news flash that talks about something horrible the Republicans did, you're probably fine believing that. This does fall apart when you go to places like Breitbart that will never say bad things about their candidates so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Sources: Probably the strongest one, if whatever article written is linking to multiple sources or at least he primary source. Generally in technical works you won't understand it, but this is a situation where if multiple sources (consensus) are agreeing you're probably okay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting some decent answers, though I would add: does the article cite the <em>primary source</em> of the information?  A lot of fake news is getting circulated because of sloppy re-reporting, aided by tools that help readers share and broadcast the errors.  It's like every stereotype about rumors versus the truth, magnified times 1000 because of the internet.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credibility of a news source can involve more than just asking, is it true or not?  Sometimes the same facts, depending upon how they are presented, can help the reader draw very different conclusions.  For example, consider these two statements:  </p>
<p>1) Mr. Brown’s experience with the criminal justice system consists of three parking tickets over the course of 30 years.  2) The suspect has had multiple run-ins with the law before.</p>
<p>Both statements are true but they paint very different portraits of the person’s character.  As others have already mentioned, it’s useful to get the story from multiple sources.  Comparing what is reported (and what information is left out) can help you identify whether a “news” source is trying to inform you or shape your opinion.</p>
<p>I try to approach “news” with a healthy skepticism, even if I'm reading something that tells me exactly what I want to hear.  Scammers exaggerate (and sometimes fabricate) the benefits of a product in order to get you excited enough to buy it.  Political websites will exaggerate (and sometimes fabricate) what the opposing party is doing in order to piss you off enough to vote the way they want you to vote.  Sometimes a sensational headline exists for no other purpose than to you get you to click the link.
Even bloggers can be helpful; while it’s important to remember that a blog post is an opinion, a well-thought-out opinion piece can sometimes give you a new perspective on an issue.</p>
<p>The good news is the Internet provides the average person with more information outlets than ever before in human history.  We can benefit from scientific research, gardening tips, animal psychology, health issues, financial guidance, and other topics to an unprecedented degree.  The flip side is that in order to make sense of all this information we need to apply a dispassionate, critical eye to what we read.  Don’t jump to conclusions, don’t limit your sources to those you know will agree with you, and don’t be afraid to challenge yourself.  It’s a bit more work, but the reward is worth it.  Happy hunting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask a simple question:  how do they know this?</p>
<p>Major newspapers pay journalists to uncover information and will cite their source.  Good chance of real information.</p>
<p>TV news will report on what papers have reported or directly from interviews.  Good chance of real information.</p>
<p>Blogs and such might report on what the prior two reported, in which case you should verify that source actually reported that thing.  But if it's original information... how do they know this?  If they are citing a press release from some agency, are the newspapers also reporting on it, or can you find that information directly from the source?  If they are making unsourced claims, that is incredibly suspect.  If they are alleging crimes, what evidence do they have (and if they have evidence why aren't they reporting this to the police)?</p>
<p>Obviously this won't protect you against biased reporting, but it will do a lot to protect you against fake &quot;facts&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
