		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, there is a backlight behind everything. Infront of the backlight are 3 layers of 'pixels', red, green and blue. Each pixel in each layer allows light (from the backlight) through when a electrical current is passed through (or in some cases, not passed through). These colours 'mix' and through the help of a polarising filter you get what you see on your monitor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's look at light.  Light can be thought of as a series of waves.  Normally, the waves are moving at all sorts of angles.  You can pass light through a <em>polarizing filter</em> which straightens out the light waves in one plane.  It does this by blocking the some of the light and letting only some through. Sort of like having messy hair and then combing it straight.  If you take 2 polarizing filters, but turn the second one 90 degrees, you can effectively block <em>all</em> the light. Got it?  Ok.  Years ago, smart researchers figured out a way to make a material polarize light when electricity was run through it.  This was
liquid crystal&quot; . Power off= no polarize. Power on: polarize.   So, combine that material with a normal polarizing filter (turned 90 degrees!) and you have created an electric light blocker!  </p>
<p>So, now you have a way to block light.  Take 3 very small versions of this (call them LCD pixels)... and put a red, green, and blue filter in front of them.  When you put light behind it and turn off the power to the 3 pixels, the light from behind shines through and lights up all 3... producing red/green/blue light...which you see as white light.  Now, power up the pixels. You can now block the light selectively.   If you have enough of them (large LCD display) , and a way to control them (computer/electronics) you can create any image you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to talk about the plain gray/black LCD displays, like you'd see on an old-school digital watch or calculator.</p>
<p>Liquid crystals only allow light to pass that is oriented in a particular direction, but that direction changes when electricity is applied to the crystals. On top of the crystals, there is a piece of glass that also only allows light with a particular orientation to pass through, but electricity doesn't change that direction.</p>
<p>When the electricity is off, those two directions line up, so that light in that direction can pass through.  But when the electricity is on, the two directions that can pass are far different from each other, so the light that can pass through the glass can't pass through the LCD, and vice versa, which means that the combination of the two of them is opaque.</p>
<p>In practice, the crystals are contained in a substrate that keeps them in particular locations, each of which can be electrified individually. They have tiny, nearly invisible wires running to each of those locations to provide the electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Next time you’re at the store, take 2 pairs of polarized sun glasses and look through two while rotating. At one angle you’ll be able to see through, at another it will black out.</p>
<p>The backlight of an LCD is polarized and then each pixel is made up of red, green, and blue filters that also have little liquid crystal cells that rotate the angle of polarization when a current runs through them so the can let through the light, block some of the light, or block nearly all the light depending on the current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the liquid crystal is derived from protein in carrots. Also, they have been around for a long time. I can't remember the exact date they were discovered, but they are quite old. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
