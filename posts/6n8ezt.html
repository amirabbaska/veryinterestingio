		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are very small photocopiers too.</p>
<p>On the large ones, most of the extra size is for complex paper handling: several large supplies of different sizes of paper; a collator that can make 10-20 separate copies of a whole document; sometimes an auto-stapler; a high-speed jam-resistant paper feeding and duplexing mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not necessarily bigger. You can get photocopier that fits in your bag and you can get printers that take up the room. But even the big photocopier have a modest sized printer and a modest sized scanner. Most of the space is taken up by rollers and shelves for moving and manipulating the paper. And this part is optional. But there is a tendency that on smaller printers you omit the scanner part to make it more compact but for bigger printers you have the scanner module as it does not matter that much and is quite useful. So it is not so much that photocopiers tend to be bigger then printers but more the fact that big printers tend to be photocopiers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You see photocopiers in office environments. They are required to handle a larger load of workflow so require more storage, and other functionalities like scanning.</p>
<p>Your average home printer is small because it needs to take up less room to fit in your computer room at home and it doesn't get used for 10 hours every day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally they are not it's the paper trays and feeds under that make it look bigger than it actually is. But for example in the office I'm in the copier is bigger as it, a Xerox workcentre 7428, is designed to print a lot of pages quickly. But even then most of it is taken up with the large laser toner cartridges </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photocopiers are not necessarily bigger than printers. What determines the size of a printer will be mostly the speed at which it prints, whether it prints single or double sided (and whether it pulls the page back in to do so), the print quality, the sizes of paper it can print, and, if applicable, the quality and size at which it can scan to copy. Age is also a factor, but comparing my 2 year old HP printer/copier (roughly the size and shape of a PC tower turned on its side) to a commercial copier of the same age, the primary difference will be print speed and quality, and the size of paper which it can print. Less often, you may also see options like a printer that staples stacks of paper for you, which will increase the size as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
