Corrective lenses for astigmatism, therefore, also have to focus differently in different directions.  Contact lenses that correct for astigmatism are weighted so that their orientation correction is gravity assisted.  Is there a different technology that could work in free fall?</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I should flair this question as physics, biology, medicine, or engineering.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back when I wore contacts, one of my eyes used a contact designed for astigmatism. Instead of weight, it relied on a small raised portion on the outside of the lens that aligned the lens each time I blinked. </p>
<p>It looks like they're still on the market- acuvue oasys 'blink stabilized' contacts are what you'd need in space. Alternatively, one could have vision corrected surgically, which I eventually opted to do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These people have gone through years of flight school and you cant even be a US Air Force Pilot without almost perfect eyesight, so I dont really think one could be an astronaut with having the necessity of contacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Further to the discussion so far about the lenses (gravity vs blink-corrected), there is another more vexing issue at work. The astronauts' eyeballs themselves are a different shape while in freefall. There is actually <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/04/518214299/doctor-launches-vision-quest-to-help-astronauts-eyeballs" target="_blank">some quite fascinating work ongoing into figuring out the mechanism behind this</a> (involving sticking instruments into former cancer patients' heads to measure pressure changes while they're strapped down in a &quot;vomit comet&quot; aircraft). </p>
<p>So the way contact lenses work may change in space, but the actual amount and type of correction that astronauts need can <em>also</em> be changing at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though this doesn't address the specific issue related to astigmatism, I thought this was useful supporting info about vision requirements to be an astronaut. </p>
<p>Astronauts can and do wear contacts in space. NASA requires pilots to have better than 20/70 correctable to 20/20 and to be a mission specialist you have to have better than 20/200 correctable to 20/20. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses generally correct for astigmatism automatically because they hold their own shape rather than conforming to your eye. I expect these would work in space, but having never been there I can't speak from experience. They work great on Earth though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
