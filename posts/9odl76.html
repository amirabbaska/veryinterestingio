		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viral DNA that becomes a part of the human genome is referred to as human endogenous retroviruses, and 8% is a generous estimate; it's typically between 4-7%. That being said, it turns out it's not too difficult to tell viral DNA apart from the original human genome. There are a few methods. </p>
<p>One method is to sequence an animals entire genome and compare it to others. There was a recent study where this was done on a Chinese Minipig and researchers could tell by looking at nucleotide substitutions and general differences in sequences. </p>
<p>A more specific answer to your question involves looking at things called histone markers and areas that have undergone DNA methylation. Histone markers are binding sites for DNA proteins, so things like enhancers and silencers. A completely silenced region with histone markers on each side can be indicative of an HERV. DNA methylation is when an extra methyl group is attached to a base. This effectively silences the gene, which again, is indicative of an HERV. </p>
<p>So long story short, almost all the viral DNA you have in your body is silenced in one way or another. Scientists can look at areas of the human DNA genome that are silenced, compare them to different human DNA and make a determination on how much of it is comprised of foreign DNA sequences. </p>
<p>NOTE: I am simply an undergrad biology student with an emphasis on genetics who also works in a genetics lab. If anyone has anything to add and/or correct, I'm all ears. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have many viral genomes sequenced as well as humans and animals. So the simplest way is just to looks for section that looks very similar to viral genes in the genome. Retroviruses are those which can integrate their genome into ours, and they have a few common genes, such as a reverse transcriptase which allows them to reverse transcribed their RNA in DNA, or an envelope gene which codes for the viral envelope.  Our genomes has heaps of these genes in them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just a guess. But genes usually have a starting region and an ending region with a certain sequence of bases on the start and end. This lets DNA polymerase know where to start transcription and where to end it. My guess is that this specific sequence is different in viral DNA  compared to human's. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
