		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in media research and I can confirm the only reason pretty much anything is done on morning TV and morning local news is to get women to stay tuned-in longer.</p>
<p>3 things drive ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tune-in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Length of tune</p>
</li>
<li>frequency</li>
</ul>
<p>If I can keep you for 5 minutes you count towards my ratings for that quarter hour. The longer I keep you the better. The more often you tune-in the better. </p>
<p>Female viewers are more habit driven in the morning, and more likely to just let the TV talk in the background and as a result they matter a whole lot more than men. Male viewers are more often driven by breaking news, the latest headlines, and getting the weather before they tune-out in the morning. Female viewers are concerned with these  but they also seek and want to hear more news. They'll stay tuned-in longer if given a reason to because they are more likely to be doing 2 or 3 things while watching. </p>
<p>Older women, 35-54, and especially 45-54, matter a ton. They are the most locked in to their routine, are less likely to utilize multiple media sources in their daily life for news and entertainment and as a result are a huge section of ratings. Including groups of these women in the background of network morning shows creates and engenders a social atmosphere. These women feel connected to each other and the show by proxy. The talent will interview individuals that fit the mold of things people in the target demo (older women) care about - family, kids, and emotional connection. Female viewers care more about safety, preparedness, and how to better prepare themselves and their family for whatever may come in the future. They care more about emotional stories and touching stories and will stay tuned-in longer if the show teases these items properly. Click-bait articles, hooks, teases, they are all geared towards getting women, especially older women (who have money to spend), to stick around longer to be exposed to more ads and potential revenue.</p>
<p>Edit - lol downvote - I legitimately described the real reason why this is done - I have the research on my desk for all morning shows and every local news broadcast in the top 70+ markets in the US. Lol</p>
<p>Edit 2: if you have a question I can do my best to answer</p>
<p>Edit 3: Thanks for the reddit gold stranger - I never in a million years figured a post about my work would get me gold. Most people get a glazed over look on their face when I try to explain what I do - maybe I'm bad at explaining it?</p>
<p>Edit 4: I know this thread may be dying but just in case anyone is still interested I raided my boss's library for a book list: </p>
<p>I just went through my boss's library. Here's a list:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who is it meant to appeal to? Women. Since the Today Show started doing this in the early 90s, the morning &quot;news&quot; shows (particularly Today and GMA) have become directly aimed at adult females from beginning to end. (The last half-hour was always more aimed at females, especially housewives; that's where you'd always get people promoting their cookbooks on the kitchen set, etc. But the first hour or so was always relatively hard news. That's no longer the case, except when something really big has happened overnight. The Today set even has hard &quot;curtains&quot; that come up out of the floor in order to hide the outside audience on mornings where something serious is going on and having a bunch of people cheering would look really bad.)</p>
<p>And yeah, it works. Today and GMA make a LOT more money today than they used to before they started doing all this. There is at least <em>some</em> sign of some people getting tired of it, though: CBS, which for a number of years did the same stuff with a street-level studio and all that, has long since abandoned it and gone to an old-school hard news format. And they have slowly been gaining on GMA and Today, though they're still quite a bit behind, ratings-wise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This started with the today show which would broadcast with a window on the street behind them showing people in the streets of New York on their way to work. Today morning news shows have devolved from actual news to smarmy entertainment and human interest talk shows showing us hiw to grill hamburgers and the people on the street are gawkers or fans hoping to be seen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
