		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>Most macro sea life would die rather immediately.  Land animals dependent on sea life could also face extinction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The heat capacity of fresh water is higher than that of salt water, which means the oceans could absorb more heat in the spring/summer and release in Autumn/winter while maintaining a more steady temp. themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fresh water freezes at a temperature 2°C warmer that saltwater.  This would likely increase the extent, thickness, and duration of the polar caps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salinity driven ocean circulation patterns would cease — leading to a redistribution of the ocean heat content with resulting climate effects.</p>
</li>
<li>Oceanic mineral deposits in equalibrium with salt water will find that equalibrium disturbed</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nearly every salt water ecosystem would die off. In the resulting food shortage and mass emigration from communities that relied on fish the original fresh water ecosystems would likely also be in danger due to fishing demands shifting to whats left. The sudden decrease in the amoubt of salt in the world would mean a lot of the minerals and salts in the soil near/under water would dissolve, which would likely damage coastal ecosystems by depriving them of nutrients. All the animals on land that relied on salt water resources such as fish would starve (i.e. pelicans) and that would move up the food chain as everything loses several food sources. With all the oceans dead, the coasts dead, and everything involved with the coasts starving to death it is likely that humanity would face a second wave of famine and emigration. The newly emptied coasts would erode much faster than before. Assuming that all of the fresh water added is the same several bodies of water that had not previously mixed would suddenly mix (think of those photos of the borders of oceans, where there is a clear divison in the water^^^I was wrong about this). This would change the flow of some currents and alter the weather patterns of the world. With new weather patterns several crop yields would be altered and a third wave of food shortages would happen during emigrations from the brand new deserts.  </p>
<p>Tldr: Ocean dies, things that need oceans die, weather breaks, its the apocalypse.  </p>
<p>Also 3 people commenting before me are shadowbanned from the looks of it. </p>
<p>Edit: The oceans meeting idea turned out to not be what those pictures I mentioned were</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just replacing the oceans with <em>salt water</em>, but not replacing the life in it, would have a huge impact. Most of the world's oxygen comes from algae, not trees. A suddenly sterile sea would change the composition of the atmosphere everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of all the horrific things others have mentioned, it would cause the shutdown of thermohaline circulation, which helps warm the higher latitudes. It's been hypothesized that a slowing of thermohaline circulation was to blame for the &quot;Little Ice Age.&quot; If circulation were to shut down completely and permanently, it could lead to dramatic changes in climate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
