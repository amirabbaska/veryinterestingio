		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was an infantry sniper in the Army from around 2013-2016.</p>
<p>We were supposed to run three man teams.  Spotter, shooter, and security.  This isn't what every sniper team runs.  For example, I have no real idea what special operations do but I would imagine a two man team at least.</p>
<p>-The spotter is the team leader and most senior on the team.  His job is to provide guidance to the shooter.  Generally in the form of walking the shooter onto target if not already there.  Determining distance and giving an elevation hold, wind hold and hold for movement if applicable.  </p>
<p>After the shot it is important to watch for trace and impact to determine hit or miss.  If there is a miss it is the spotters job to give a quick follow up call for the shooter.  Simultaneously it is the shooters job to tell the spotter if they broke the shot clean or if they feel like the pulled directionally.</p>
<p>The spotter also carries a long gun, usually something like a precision semi auto, but isn't the primary shooter.</p>
<p>-The shooters job is to focus on the shots and as I said above to tell the spotter if they think their shot was their fault.</p>
<p>-The security is basically your new guy.  He is there to carry extra shit(ammo/batteries/radio maybe) and watch your back while you are both focused down range.  </p>
<p>TL;DR - Spotter is the leader and guides the shooter.</p>
<p>Edit:  Thanks for the gold!  Trying to keep up in comments.</p>
<p>Edit:  I just want to be clear, I never deployed but I am sniper qualified and trained for the position.  I'm not trying to take away from those who did.  Any actual combat experience supersedes my experience.</p>
<p>Also, I'm going back to school for civil engineering.  So if anyone wants to hire me that would be awesome.  Northern Colorado, pm me!  Shameless plug I know... worth a shot!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former army sniper here. There are several reasons you have a spotter. One is that ideally all the shooter should have to do is trigger pull, so you need someone to spot hits and give adjustment to get on target or where the next target is. The second is that rifle optics have a relatively narrow field of view compared to binoculars or a spotting scope, so the spotter has a better overall picture of what is going on. This also frees up the spotter to do secondary activities like calling up Intel reports and calling for fire. Finally you would never send a soldier into the field alone, so you may as well augment there abilities with some of similar skill set.<br />
Edit: an addendum to what I am seeing in the comments, the spotter is almost always the more experienced of the two, but not always the better shooter, as their emphasis is on target designation and quick correction which are skills developed over time.  Edit 2: thanks for the gold trying to keep up with comments but at work</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The military has an axiom: &quot;There is no such thing as an individual&quot;</p>
<p>This underlies everything that is done.  For example, the smallest unit in the Canadian Infantry is the Fire Team- for us that's a two soldier group. (the Fire Team is one half of an Assault Group, of which there are two in a Rifle Section...and on it goes upward)</p>
<p>What this is intended to mean is that the welfare of the group is greater than the welfare of the individual- which might seem straightforward to some- but it is this group mentality which can be critical to success on the battlefield.  There is a great deal of psychology and philosophy wrapped up in this concept.  It is a very interesting thing to study because it can be both deeply indoctrinated and at times counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>As far as snipers go, the top comment got this more or less correct.  Very simply, two sets of eyes are better than one.</p>
<p>That, and the art of sniping is far more than what it is often seen reduced to in popular media- look down a telescopic sight, put the crosshairs in between the eyes, pull trigger.  </p>
<p>The science involved in making or ensuring conditions for a successful shot, particularly at extreme ranges requires a great deal of complex calculations and using equipment that would require a solitary shooter to leave his firing position to work with.</p>
<p>Marksmanship is a lot like getting a good golf swing.  It is an entire body discipline.  We use the acronym &quot;HABIT&quot; to teach the principles of marksmanship to each and every recruit:</p>
<p>H Holding- a firm, controlled grasp of the weapon.  The body of the shooter is to be imagines as a stabilizer, not unlike a bipod.</p>
<p>A Aiming- pick a point of aim- centre of mass- and do not waver from it while engaging this target.</p>
<p>B Breathing- particularly while lying flat in the prone position, the mere act of breathing will raise or lower the weapon's muzzle.  Be conscious of breathing patterns, and always try to fire while holding a half exhaled breath (the pattern we teach is &quot;breath in-breathe out- breathe in-halfway out, hold-BANG-all the way out&quot;)</p>
<p>I  Instinctive Positioning- this ties in to what I said above.  From head to feet, the shooter must hold their position as still as possible. The slightest movement at the firing point will put the shot off.  The further away the shooter is to target, the more a tiny fraction of movement can take a definite hit and create a wide miss.  At the extreme ranges snipers operate, this is critical.  </p>
<p>T  Trigger Control- even the way in which the trigger finger operates the weapon can create a nudge that would shift point of aim.  A smooth, slow and fluid motion against the slack of the trigger is to be followed through in the same way. A quick snap on the trigger is called a &quot;jerk&quot; for a reason.</p>
<p>So, those very basic concepts in &quot;HABIT&quot; is merely the foundation upon which the sniper is putting his shot together.  Any information that they need or communication to their superiors beyond what can be done from a steadied firing position will be handled by the spotter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sniping (ideally) involves the development of range cards, sort of hand-drawn maps centered on the sniper's location, that is annotated with all sorts of information relevant to shooting. It typically is based on prominent features, things like a signpost, a turn in the road, etc. So in an engagement the spotter is typically reading off data from the range card while the shooter is looking at that through the scope or making adjustments to the settings on the scope's turrets (thus minimizing the amount of guesswork in aligning your crosshairs.)  </p>
<p>Spotters are also 'sanity checks' to confirm a sniper's assessment of distance, or math-check a calculation. They may be using a laser rangefinder while the sniper is engaged with the rifle. While a sniper can at one level just be 'some guy with a gun' - a well trained sniper team is able to adapt to dynamic and changing conditions and deliver first-round accuracy with much greater precision. I suppose it is like a pit crew: one guy could change tires and fill gas but an Indy500 crew can do all of it in a few seconds.</p>
<p>Another important part of being a spotter is watching your own perimeter. If you have ever snuck up on a sniper in an FPS you realize how they become tunnel-visioned looking thru a scope. The spotter will typically have something more carbine-esque that is suitable for dealing with patrols or people who sneak up on snipers.  Just a couple parts of the big picture, hope it helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recoil from a high powered rifle (almost) always causes the sniper to temporarily lose sight of his target. By the time the he reacquires the target, the bullet has hit. If it was a miss, he has no way of knowing if he was high, low, left, or right. The spotter never loses sight of the target, and can tell the sniper what corrections he needs to make. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
