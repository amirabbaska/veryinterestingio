Or do they do it all at once at the end of the day? Are they advised to speak in present tense so editors can make their commentary seem like it's happening real-time?</p>
<p>Also, where does it happen? Are there several rooms or just one where they each take turns?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;confessional&quot; is when the camera cuts from the action of the reality show to a separately filmed 'interview' where a participant comments on their reaction to the events as if it's happening at that specific time, and then switches back. They do it to increase drama and make the people seem more real. </p>
<p>And it varies depending on the type of show, often influenced further by how &quot;genuine&quot; versus &quot;ridiculously staged&quot; the show is. </p>
<p>On the sole-reality-participant shows (Survivorman, for example), they film it themselves during their next 'break'. </p>
<p>Sometimes it's performed in a side room almost immediately during a break in the action, when for example, they're restocking a cooking show competition's pantry. </p>
<p>Often it's performed afterward, sometimes weeks afterward, where the participant watches some footage of the build-up that may have already gone through editing, and is asked &quot;Okay, what was your reaction at this time? How were you feeling?&quot; This is often used in the remotely-filmed shows like some of the Alaskan homesteader families or fishing/ice-road driving, or where there's work locations involved like exotic goldfish-tank constructions.</p>
<p>In ones based on a competition, they'll film extra and cherrypick the wildest statements in interviews to maximize drama, selecting carefully to keep things surprising and avoiding giving away or misleading on who's going to be eliminated. In others, and particularly the more dismal ones where there are artificial obstacles, the interviewees know it's all about saying what will be the most over the top. One of the surviving-adversity ones where two guys get stranded somewhere and have to work their way out was HORRIBLE at this, and although I enjoyed the techniques and show, the interviews were truly cringeworthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I knew I could finally start trusting my unreliable partner when he skinned that dead snake with his teeth to help make a filter for clean water that would also polish our shoes. That type of inventiveness made me finally realize I had selected the right co-star for this idiotic adventure in the Mojave desert where we had to drag a live trussed cow fifteen miles to where its calf had been abandoned. Now, NOW... we were best buds.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any fans/hate-watchers of The Bachelor, the show Unreal was created by a former producer on The Bachelor about her experience. When they show the confessional process, the producer asks the contestant guiding questions to get them to say certain things about other people or events that happened, and sometimes tells them made up rumors to create drama. Some of the smarter contestants will willingly play along with the producers to give them what they want, even when they know they are being manipulated.</p>
<p>I don't know how much it differs on a show like Hell's Kitchen, but I assume the idea is similar (but with a little less forced drama).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Friend was on a &quot;Real World Challenge&quot; show. Said the confessional was a daily duty on the show where a producer would ask you questions about occurrences/other contestants. On occasion they would reveal something someone had said about them to try and start feuds or make people hook-up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Hell's kitchen specifically, they do it at the end in one big hour-long session. The interviewer will say something like 'such and such happened today, how did you feel about it?', they'll reply, then the interviewer asks them to say it in a particular way. They'll often really obviously try to coax a specific answer out of them.
