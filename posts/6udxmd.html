		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a ton of misinformation on this post. Sorry for that but really we don't know what causes them or why they go away. The current theory is that the motor neuron that controls the muscular contraction is malfunctioning and secreting too much acetylcholine, which is the chemical that allows a muscle to contract. So the muscle is just in a steadily contracted form. A mild contracture. </p>
<p>Manual therapies are meant to &quot;reset&quot; this malfunction by sort of tricking the neurons into relaxing. </p>
<p>The neuron is accidentally sending a signal to your brain that says that this is the most relaxed state for this muscle. What we do is gently force that muscle into a relaxed position. </p>
<p>Edit: i do hope more people see this. Some of the top comments on here say that there's no scientific evidence that massage does anything. Well yeah uh.  There's no scientific evidence of anything if you don't look it up. Massage is proven to stimulate RNA synthesis  to the massaged region. It helps rebuild your tissue in the aid of recovery. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's little scientific evidence to support massage as a recovery technique in terms of waste product removal. </p>
<p>The circulation increase from massage is achieved tenfold simply by using the muscles you want circulation to improve in.</p>
<p>I.e. Athletes conduct 'warm downs' that are specific to the musculature they just used. A football player will often be told to immediately jump onto a stationary bike once off the field from a game to keep circulation going to his legs after the final minutes of sprinting in a match. Simply walking around will increase your circulation.</p>
<p>As for your muscles feeling better after a massage? They were tight, they got stretched, now they're less tight. Just use a daily flexibility program to reduce your muscle stiffness and increase your joint ROM (range of motion). You can do active stretching (you stretch your muscle as much as you can) and you can do passive stretching (someone else stretches your muscle to varying degrees). Google search PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) stretching techniques if you want to learn more or try it yourself. </p>
<p>We're taught that if there's no harm and something can cause psychological benefit (placebo effect) in an athlete, then you may as well do it. (4th year Exercise Science + Rehab &amp; Exercise Physiology student).</p>
<p>This is an unpopular opinion because it could be detrimental toward the massage industry but there's no concrete evidence or meta analysis that currently support massage's supposed effect of enhancing recovery and maintaining performance. (These are two very important recovery goals.)</p>
<p>Please do keep in mind that when performed after a soft tissue injury a massage is definitely not recommended. You'll throw up afterward as you're messing with the healing process. (Specifically a soft tissue injury with an inflammatory response.)</p>
<p>Please don't take this reply as an insult to massage techniques or the people who perform them. They're very skilled (sometimes) and very passionate about their job (always IMO). Those are two great things to have in someone you purchase a service from.
They provide an awesome service that I'm sure will be around for a long time. However as soon as someone tries to push their supposed scientific evidence behind massage physiological benefits onto me, it annoys me. There are no marked physiological benefits that have been concretely proven from massage. It's purely a psychological thing. (A damn good psychological thing, don't underestimate the mind.)(Psychological benefits were anecdotally recorded in most studies.)</p>
<p>The gilded top comment reply is essentially correct up until:</p>
<p>&quot;when you find a knot (trigger point, sore spot or whatever you wanna call it) when you press on it you are pushing that calcium myosin mixture out of the area back into the venous system&quot;</p>
<p>There's no proper evidence when you combine both the disproving and proving papers to suggest that you're pushing anything into the venous system. This claim simply doesn't exist. </p>
<p>If you'd like an example of a successful recovery technique that does manage to reduce oedema and enhance venous return then check out 'cold water immersion'. It has nothing to do with calcium reuptake or myosin filaments. It does however utilise the hydrostatic pressure applied to your body when immersed in water as well as your body's natural response to cold water immersion. These seem like big words but they aren't complicated at all. When you hop in a pool at the shallow end and walk to the deep end (slowly increasing water immersion from your waist to your neck), you can feel the pressure building over your body. That's the hydrostatic pressure. The cold water component is typically conducted in 10-12 degree Celsius water (freezing cold and horrible) and your body reacts to this by shunting blood away from the peripheries (vessels near skin) and toward the core (closer to the heart). This stops us from losing heat so easily when we need to conserve it. (Our body has an optimal temperature of roughly 37 degrees Celsius in which our metabolic life maintaining cellular activities perform best.) When we heat up we do the opposite, we dilate the blood vessels near the skin which lets us lose heat faster so that our core temperature doesn't go too far above 37 degrees. (These are homeostatic mechanisms.) I'll leave a link to the AIS website. The Australian Institute of Sport is an international leader on recovery technique research in elite athletes. (I'm Australian, I'm not affiliated or an employee of AIS). There's alot note to this topic but I'm on my mobile so I can't write a lecture's worth of important extra details. </p>
<p>Please also keep in mind that CWI isn't for every athlete or person. It's actually detrimental to a small degree for weight lifters. Essentially you want to build and progress your muscles via protein synthesis (increased window post workout for PS),  you don't want to reduce blood flow to the muscles which is what CWI does. If you're training for physical adaptions (muscle bulk+) it's probably not for you. If you bulked pre season and are just practicing football drills and maintaining muscle then CWI can help because that higher protein synthesis window is not as relevant to you.(Ignore this paragraph if it's not relevant to you, it may seem confusing!) </p>
<p>Link from my mobile: (It goes straight to a PDF download, just Google search 'Cold water immersion AIS' if you don't like links or it doesn't work.)</p>

<p>I've never heard of a calcium myosin mixture and have found nothing peer reviewed to support this idea. As far as I know myosin myofilaments are just a component of the cross bridges that allow us to move. Just Google 'Sliding Filament Theory' to understand it better. It's actually super interesting to understand but it's too much to explain in a Reddit reply.</p>
<p>So it's true that we use calcium to unlock Troponin from it's position atop Tropomyosin which effectively blocks myosin filament crossbridges from attaching to actin filaments when we don't want them to (muscle relaxation). In short, calcium is the key, troponin is the lock, tropomyosin is the gate and actin was the thing behind the locked gate that myosin wants to attach to.
There's no concrete evidence to suggest that massage as a recovery technique removes 'excess calcium' that the sarcoplasmic reticulum didn't reuptake. (Reuptake occuring as a result of our CNS signalling the muscle to relax). </p>
<p>I'm happy to keep answering replies but please keep it civil. I'm not here to rain on anyone's parade. I get massages whenever I can afford them because I enjoy them too. I've performed localised massages on athletes as a sports trainer while I've worked in Aussie rules football clubs in my area and if the player is happy then that's often all that matters.</p>
<p>TLDR: Zero meta analysis or concrete research to prove anything other than a psychological benefit from massage.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the potential for physical benefit is possible but it isn't proven across studies (varies widely) and is often the result of a psychological benefit.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Thank you for the gold.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Typos fixed and a paragraph added.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Sorry if this is not ELI5, please feel free to send criticism that I can use to clarify my post further. I'm a newish Redditor.</p>
<p>Have a great day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The truth is, OP, we don't really know what causes muscle knots, and we don't really know what's going on when they seem to relax or dissipate. See <a href="https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-point-doubts.php" target="_blank">https://www.painscience.com/articles/trigger-point-doubts.php</a> for a great, accessible treatment of this topic. </p>
