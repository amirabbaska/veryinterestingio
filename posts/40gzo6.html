		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the light <em>would</em> reach the second ship!</p>
<p>Let's say two spaceships are flying away from each and that an observer between them sees each of them moving with a speed v0. Now let's look at things from the frame of reference of one of the pilots. From his perspective, he will see the second ship move away with an apparent speed (v'). What is important to note is that this apparent speed will <em>not</em> just be the sum of the two initial speeds, i.e. (2v0). Instead, the formula you need to use to add up the velocities must <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Special_relativity" target="_blank">include a relativistic correction</a>, which gives:</p>
<p>v' = (v0 + v0)/(1+v0*v0/c^(2))</p>
<p>For example if v0 is 0.6c, you get v' to be 0.88c. Note that this is still less than the speed of light. On top of that, we know from special relativity that light (in vacuum) always moves at a speed of c <em>in every inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference.</em> Because we have light moving at c chasing a ship that is moving more slowly than c, the light will eventually reach the second ship^(1). One thing to note is that the light received by the second pilot will be significantly redshifted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect" target="_blank">relativistic Doppler Effect</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The one major caveat is that the spaceships can't be so far apart that the expansion of the universe is a major factor.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> I made it more explicit that at high speeds the equation for adding up velocities is different from the low speed limit we are more familiar with on a daily basis; clarified that the reasoning above only rigorously applies to non-accelerating frames of reference</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know other users have already answered this, but I'll put in my explanation too.</p>
<p>The axiom of special relativity is that <strong>the speed of light is constant in all references frames</strong>. From this, we can go through the physics and derive some interesting results:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(relativistic) velocities do not add linearly, i.e. 0.5<em>c</em> + 0.5<em>c</em> != 1<em>c</em>. Similarly, if I'm traveling at 0.5<em>c</em> and launch a rocket at 0.5<em>c</em> (w.r.t. my frame), its velocity will not be 1<em>c</em> in a &quot;stationary&quot; frame, and will appear as an entirely different velocity in the frame of the other ship. (There is an explicit formula for adding relativistic velocities.) However...</p>
</li>
<li>if I somehow launch a rocket at the speed of light from my moving ship, its velocity will be 1<em>c</em> in my frame, the stationary frame, <em>and</em> the frame of the other ship. Even if I'm traveling at 0.999<em>c</em>, I will see light travel at speed 1<em>c</em>, not at 0.001<em>c</em> as you would expect. </li>
</ul>
<p>The short answer being, yes, they will see each other in the sense that the light from one will reach the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is constant in all reference frames. </p>
<p>Imagine you are standing exactly in the middle between the two ships. Because light always travels at c (in a vacuum), this means that the light that is coming towards you from ship A will pass by you with a speed of c. Since ship B is travelling away from you at 'only' 0.5c, the light that passes by you (which is travelling at c) will eventually reach ship B.</p>
<p>The same thing is true if the ships were travelling at 90% or 99% or 99.999% of c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Damn, most of these answers are way more complicated than they need to be.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that everyone always sees light as moving at <em>c</em>.  So it doesn't matter what else is going on, you'll always see it at that speed.  Thus, since you are not moving at <em>c</em>, it will eventually catch you.  The math is not needed to answer the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest explanation is that light always travels at c.</p>
<p>So it would leave the first ship traveling at c no matter how fast the ship is moving away.  It would then travel at c towards the other ship and eventually reach it because the other ship is traveling at 0.5c.</p>
<p>EDIT: Even if the speed of the ship is greater than 0.5c it will be less than c and the light will reach it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
