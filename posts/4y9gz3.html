		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 version.  Blackjack has a memory unlike other games.  Big cards good, small cards bad.  5 year-olds shouldn't gamble anyways. </p>
<p>Source: former casino employee and card counter.</p>
<p>I'll start with some terms here:</p>
<p>House edge: expressed in a percentage.  The money the house expect to win on each bet.  </p>
<p>Basic stragety: a tested theorem that that dictates a players move in a given blackjack hand. Please Google basic strategy,  there's a neat color coded chart you can look at.</p>
<p>Units: the number of increments of the minimum bet that the table maximum will allow.  For example, if you are on a $5 minimum BJ table with a limit of $250  that only allows you to play one hand you can bet 50 units.</p>
<p>House edge is a representation of the mathematical advantage that the house has built in its rules..  Here are some examples.<br />
Roulette:  straight up bet pays 35 to 1.  I'd you win you get 35 plus your bet. There is 1 way to win, and on a double 0 wheel, 37 ways to lose. If you cover every number (stupid) you lose 38 and win 36.  So your return is 36/38.  That's 94.7% return  giving the house an edge of 5.3%
Craps:  betting on a hop (one roll bet) pays to 30 for 1, 30 to 1, 15 for 1, or 15 to 1.  Deference here is academic in this case, most casinos only for one, but to one is better.  The 30s are for pairs (hard ways).  Let's say you think 11 will come next roll.  There are 2 ways to roll 11, 6-5, and 5-6, if you have problems seeing this, pretend the dice are different colors.  2 dice x 6 sides = 36 combos.   You have 2 ways to win out of 36.  Or, 1 in 18.  This bet at best pays 15 to 1.  So win 16, lose 18.  That's an 88.8% return giving the house an edge of 11.2%.
SERIOUSLY, I KNOW HOP BETS SUCK.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOUSE EDGE.  Bet the pass line with 10x odds.  Happy?</p>
<p>The edge represents the difference between the true odds vs payable odds.  With me so far?  </p>
<p>Here's where things change.
In all other games of &quot;chance&quot;, these odds never change.  Two dice always roll 11 with the same 2/36 chance, number 21 comes up approximately 1 out of 38 times in roulette. This is inescapable.  Short term variance is expected and even necessary,  no one would play a game where they always lost.  But blackjack and it's variants (of the non continuous shuffle variety) are different fundamentally, they have memory.  There a finite number of cards in that games universe if you will.  In a 6 deck shoe (suits don't matter in BJ) there are 312 cards.
24 of each A-9, and 96 10 value cards (10, J, Q, K no difference between these functionally)
Basic strategy is a statistical model that, based on the  rules of the casino at which you are playing, help you make the least bad decision.  I say least bad, because it is accurate.  There are no good decisions in blackjack because statistically it is still a negative expectation game.  Meaning, over a large sampling, with perfect basic strategy, you will still lose.  Now, this is for everyone in the back, STATISTICAL OUTCOMES HAVE NOTING TO FUCKING DO WITH SHORT TERM SUCCESS OR FAILURE!!!!!!</p>
<p>So, a recap here.  Most games suck because the odds are bad and built in.  You can chose less bad bets, but all bets are bad, get it?</p>
<p>But wait,  you said Black Jack is different!  It is.  As I said,  basic strategy lets you make the least bad decisions.  Some situations actually have a positive expected outcome, like doubling down when you have 11 vs a dealers up card of 6.  Keep in mind though, that the aggregate of all those situations still places you in the territory of negative expectation.  </p>
<p>Card counting:  there are plenty of tutorials online to teach this, but as a very simple rule of thumb, because of the rules of hitting and staying that casinos follow for their dealers, big cards favor the player, while little cards favor the dealer.  I'm not going to get into the math here, it's rather lengthy, but suffice to say that knowing the ratio of big cards to little cards remaining in the deck can offer an advantage to the player.  </p>
<p>So, why does the dealer have the advantage on black jack?  It's not their hit/stand rules.  Those only exist because if they were any more lenient to the dealer no one would play.  THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THE HOUSE HAS IN BJ IS THE DOUBLE BUST LOSS.
Scenario 1.  Player has 20, dealer busts.  Player wins
Scenario 2.  Player has 20, dealer has 20.  Player pushes (ties) nobody loses/wins
Scenario 3.  Player busts his hand, dealer has 20.  Dealer wins.</p>
<p>These all seem fair so far.  Here's the one that earns all the house it's money.
Scenario 4.  Player busts his hand.  Dealer busts his hand.  Player still loses.</p>
<p>That's it.  They only advantage.  So, try not to take hits that can bust you unless you statistically need to.</p>
<p>Let's now regroup.  </p>
<ol>
<li>You know that busting loses your money, though paradoxically, standing when you should hit, while reducing your bust %, actually lowers your statical overall win % more.</li>
<li>You know that because 10s are good for you and little cards are bad, if you can keep track of the ratio of that and are in the right situation, you can have an advantage over the house.  The average difference in expressed advantage generally is only 2%.  Let's say the house has a 51-49 advantage over you, sometimes you can make that 51-49 in your favor with counting.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you take advantage of this?  Unit betting.<br />
Let's take a $5 dollar table. It has 7 spots.  You are the only player.  It's max is$ 500. This casino let's you play all 7 spots if the table is empty.  Therefore, the unit spread is as follows 500/5 = 100 units per spot *7 spots = 700 unit spread.  (This is an example only, doing this will get you labeled as a counter on the spot and backed off immediately) As you know the deck (shoe) favors the dealer most of the time it makes sense to expose the least amount of your money to that negative expectation.  When the 10 ratio changes in your favor, you can now expose 700 times that bet to a positive outcome.<br />
So while you're only going to have a %2 advantage, you're now betting 3500 with a better than even chance of winning.  (YES I KNOW THINGS GET STREAKY SOMETIMES.  SHUT UP, THESE ARE BASICS. GO FIND SOME COUNTING SUB REDDIT)</p>
<p>So, get it?  Expose less of you money when you're at a disadvantage and more when it's in your favor.  Counting is the exact reverse of the casino model.  You're eking out wins on a small marking, but unlike the casini, you can alter your betting and actions with this knowledge </p>
<p>TL;DR. yes, blackjack is the a beatable game, but only if you're a card counter.</p>
<p>P.s. baccarat.  Yes, it is a coin flip.  And yes, I've heard of a way to count it.  Here the only situation I know of where it can be counted.  At the beginning of the shoe, the dealer reveals the first card and burns that many cards.  If you can keep track of the 10s in the shoe, and this count of remaining 10 in the deck is equal to burn cards plus the remaining cards in the deck after the cut card is pulled out, theoretically you could guarantee a tie bet, but I'd be willing that this is sore rare in practice, you're better off just studying something useful and getting a career change or a promotion.</p>
<p>Sorry about the spelling, this is a long comment for a phone and my dog has been licking my face</p>
<p>Edits:  edited for grammar and spelling, as well as an expanded craps section because some random craps player thinks he knows what's going on and was confused.  As always first reddit gold, thanks so much.  Also, for people saying poker, pai-gow, video poker, craps!</p>
<p>I try not to talk about thing I don't know much about, but here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Poker is beatable if you're good.or with weak players. </li>
<li>No commission pai-gow that let's you bank every other hand is probably close to 50-50. Don't know for sure, check the math.</li>
<li>Apparently you can count baccarat, just got a link to look at.</li>
<li>Yes, some video poker offers an advantage.  Google it</li>
<li>Yes, crops has some good bets.  Pass with 10x odds is like .43% house edge or something stupid small.  Still not 0</li>
<li>Advantage play tons of advanced techniques like shuffle tracking, hole tracking, taking advantage of weak delaers, sure that may make a game beatable.  YMMV</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me clear up some misconceptions in this thread.</p>
<p>Credentials: Professional poker player in Las Vegas for 9 years. Not a card counter  but know plenty who do (or did).</p>
<p>1) Perfect basic strategy without counting + good house rules gets you very close to 50% equity. It's over 49%. This is reduced significantly by bad house rules (ie pay 6:5 on blackjack).  You cannot get over 50% without counting and properly adjusting your bets based on the odds for that hand.</p>
<p>2) Part of why you can beat blackjack is the &quot;history&quot; as has been mentioned.  The other part is the ability to bet SIGNIFICANTLY more when you have an edge vs when you don't.  Betting $10 many times as 49.8% dog, and then $50 or $100 a few times as a 54% favorite, will yield positive equity and thus profit in the long run.</p>
<p>3) Blackjack is still very beatable, but casinos have gotten much smarter over the years.  The rules are generally worse and favor the house more than in years past.  They're better at spotting counters and teams.  I know a number of people who have made significant money (well into 6 figures) by counting, and have subsequently been banned or flat bet. It's a good way to make short-term money if you know what you're doing, but you need a significant bankroll as the swings can be enormous.</p>
<p>4) Assuming you're not counting, then other players playing correctly or incorrectly will NOT affect your equity. Someone hitting when they should stay is just as likely to help you as hurt you, so leave them alone and let them do as they please. Anyone saying otherwise does not understand statistics.</p>
<p>EDIT TO ADD</p>
<p>5) Some comments have mentioned poker, sports betting, horse racing, and certain video poker / slots as other profitable opportunities if you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>Poker is obviously true, as many people make their living playing poker.  The key difference is that you play against other players and simply pay the casino a flat rate, so they don't care if you win.  Literally thousands and probably tens of thousands of people around the world make their living playing poker, both in casinos and online.</p>
<p>Sports betting is true, although it takes a lot of work and very good computer models to beat it.  Also never, ever, ever pay for a tout service to give you picks.  100% of them are scams.</p>
<p>Horse racing I'm honestly not sure about, as I know next to nothing about it.  But I've been in Vegas a long time and have never met someone who is a professional horse bettor.  Anecdotally, everyone in that section of the sports book looks like a degenerate (or someone just having fun on vacation).  But maybe?  If anyone knows more I'd like to hear.</p>
<p>Video poker / slots is also true under certain circumstances.  Some of the progressive jackpot slots can actually be pretty lucrative when the jackpot gets big enough, but it's an enormous time sink and requires an enormous bankroll.  I know people that have tried to take advantage, and they give up after not too long.  The edge on profitable video poker machines is small and you're not going to make any significant money grinding those.  Minimum wage maybe.</p>
<p>People who are VERY good at heads up limit holdem can beat the poker machines (NOT video poker, but actual poker played against an AI).  The AI is awfully good though, and will absolutely obliterate a random tourist.  They put these things outside of poker rooms and they must absolutely print money on them to an absurd degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blackjack is the only game who's outcome is dependent upon past actions. Like, once an ace is played and discarded players know that ace is gone and won't be seen again.
Keeping track of what cards have been played can give a player good prediction of what will come up. Knowing that they can adjust their bets so they win big when odds are good and loose little when odds are bad.
Casinos fight against this by using multiple decks of cards, re-shuffling at random times, and good old intimidation.
&quot;Card counting&quot; (the simple process of keeping track of what's been played and understanding current odds) mathematically gives a player a 0.5% advantage over the house. Some say it's as high as 1%, some say 0.1%. But, no matter what, it won't make you rich over night. To see a 0.5% advantage pay off you'll have to play a lot and over a significant amount of time. Those who did get rich with card counting did it with a team.
And, don't forget, casinos can ask anyone to leave for no reason at all. If you're statistically winning more than you should, you may get a tap on your shoulder.
So, mathematically, yes, you'll have an advantage in blackjack because it is a continuing, past dependent, outcome.  But, in real life, you simply won't be allowed to sit at a table and take the Casino's money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blackjack, as played, has enough of a history (that is, a history with the current deck, not a history as in &quot;500 years ago...&quot;) so that you can know the odds going forward and adjust your bets accordingly. Compare that to roulette. Every spin of the roulette wheel has the exact same odds, which favor the casino. By the end of a particular blackjack shoe, the odds might slightly favor the player. If you know that, and bet high when the odds are in your favor and low when they are not, you can come out ahead. There are lots of ways that casinos prevent this, but it is at least conceivable to do. With roulette, it's impossible. I am unfamiliar with the rules of most other games, but I don't believe any have a known history like blackjack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if someone gave you a million dollars, and said that you have to bet some amount of it on every football game during a season. If you pick the winner, you receive double your bet. Otherwise, you lose your bet.</p>
<p>Even if you don't know much about football, you could play it safe and bet $1 on most games. Then, when the best team is facing the worst team, you could crank up your bet to $100,000 because you know the odds are in your favor. Chances are you'll be able to make a lot of money with this strategy.</p>
<p>Card counting in blackjack works the same way. An experienced card counter can track the cards remaining in the deck, betting the minimum until the deck is in his favor, and then ramp up his bets to the maximum.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind this method ONLY works because the casino allows you to choose how much you bet. Strictly speaking, blackjack is not mathematically beatable if you had to bet the same amount on every hand. And casinos have implemented lots of other ways to combat card counting, such as using multiple decks, and video machines which shuffle the deck after every hand. It's not so viable anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
