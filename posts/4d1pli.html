		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means that you're not arguing against what your opponent actually said, but against an exaggeration or misrepresentation of his argument. You appear to be fighting your opponent, but are actually fighting a &quot;straw man&quot; that you built yourself. Taking the example from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: We should relax the laws on beer.<br />
B: 'No, any society with unrestricted access to intoxicants loses its work ethic and goes only for immediate gratification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B appears to be arguing against A, but he's actually arguing against the proposal that there should be no laws restricting access to beer. A never suggested that, he only suggested relaxing the laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it helps think of what the actual term is referring to.</p>
<p>A person makes a dummy of another person made out of straw. They then beat it up and claim they can beat up that person.</p>
<p>It's not true, it was only so easy because it wasn't the actual person. It was a similarly looking dummy but easily defeated.</p>
<p>However from a distance an observer might make the mistake that the straw man was the actual person.</p>
<p>So a straw man argument is one that looks like what your opponent said but is easily defeated. Usually it's an exaggeration of the original argument that no sane person would believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A straw man argument is a tactic used in a debate where you refute a position your opponent does not hold. Your opponent makes their argument, you then construct a gross misrepresentation/parody of your opponent's argument (this is your man of straw), and then refute <em>that</em>. Thus you refute your own parody, without ever addressing the argument your opponent actually made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who don't understand straw man arguments are total assholes, so why would you listen to them?  (That's ad hominem.)  Any <em>real</em> internet commenter will understand the straw man fallacy.  (That's No True Scotsman.)  For you to not understand straw man, you're basically arguing that it's OK to be illiterate, and research has clearly shown that illiteracy prevents nations from entering the modern era -- are you seriously against modernity?  (That's straw man!)</p>
<p>EDIT: You can also understand the straw man fallacy in fiction.  I'll give you a great example here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaOZS60-Imw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaOZS60-Imw</a></p>
<p>Here you can see Tina Fey quoting Sarah Palin verbatim (looks like she messed up the word order a couple of times, but still) to show how ridiculous Sarah Palin is.  That's <em>not a fallacy</em>.  But here is another Tina Fey video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epPT1yjjOvk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epPT1yjjOvk</a></p>
<p>Here, she says that she can see Russia from her house, as the sum total of Palin's foreign policy credentials.  That's not Palin's <em>actual</em> position, but this satirical quote became so popular that people thought that Palin had actually said it.  <em>That's</em> the straw man fallacy, pointing out how ridiculous Palin's argument is that seeing Russia from her house is foreign policy experience, when in reality that was never her argument.  When Tina Fey does it, it's satire -- it's still a fallacy, but it's a fallacy used for the purposes of humor and to highlight the actual arguments by comparison.</p>
<p>The straw man fallacy misrepresents an argument.  The direct quote in the first clip is not a misrepresentation.  (It's not even out of context!  Sarah Palin really was that ridiculous!)  &quot;I can see Russia from my house&quot; <em>is</em> a misrepresentation, taking Palin's actual answer on foreign policy experience out of context and making satire of it.  &quot;I can see Russia from my house&quot; uses the straw man fallacy -- but it's OK because it's satire; an informed viewer would realize that it's not serious.  Unfortunately, Sarah Palin's <em>actual</em> ridiculousness confused the less-informed viewers into thinking that she really had said that!  I suppose that's successful satire...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
