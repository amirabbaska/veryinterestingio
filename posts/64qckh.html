		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>A lot of time has passed, it's kind of the &quot;default&quot; and so is unremarkable, and English and Americans have the same basic appearance.</em></p>
<p>The time part comes because the last major emigrations from England were in colonial times, well over two hundred years ago. That's somewhere over 10 generations - most people stop talking about that sort of thing two or sometimes three generations back at most -  and unless you're a family tree hobbyist that has a key interest in your own origins, it's just too many generations back to have much relevance. So you denote yourself as American, and your connection to the &quot;English&quot; way of life has since long declined and been replaced with your own country's self-created culture. </p>
<p>That factor changes if, say, your grandma's Italian, and things like cuisine and the level of closeness that you share with your family can be a huge part of your identity. That makes you different from most Americans, and so it's going to come up in conversation.</p>
<p>The appearance part comes because you look the same as the bog-standard American if you're of English ancestry. You're not a visible minority with oriental folds in your eyes, very distinctive skin colour or hair colour or hair curliness, or other highly visible traits, so it's not something you really talk about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, most Americans don't bother identifying with their ancestral culture/nation. Using the compound nationality is the exception, not the rule. Americans that do this fit one or more of these criteria (generally speaking):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nationality/ethnicity faced substantial discrimination during large waves of immigration in the last century or so. This is true of Italians, Irish, and Chinese. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recently immigrated (1-3rd gen). Such Americans may be actively retaining practices, traditions, language etc.., of their old country. </p>
</li>
<li>Non-western european race is visually obvious, as in asians. But you can't assume it here, either. Lots of racially asian American families have been in the US for centuries and may or may not feel any strong connection. But they may continue to identify as Chinese-American (or whatever) simply for the reason that they face discrimination and stereotypes and need to combat that by asserting the normality of ethnic and cultural blending.</li>
</ol>
<p>Americans of English descent, like myself, are a lot like the 3rd category minus racism. Both of my parent's family names are super-duper English. But that was ~5 generations ago. I would never identify as English because I'm not English in any way. I'm American, like my parents and their and theirs. English culture is great, and it's interesting to reflect on the history, but it really has very little to do with who I am as a person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, pleased to meet you. I'm an American with English heritage. :D</p>
<p>I always knew about it, but never really pointed it out until I moved to Japan, where lots of people needed help sorting out the fact that they'd meet Americans who didn't seem to have common national customs. Explaining that my family is partially British went a long way in explaining why my family has certain customs that other Americans in Japan might not. </p>
<p>Now that I'm back in the US, I have to break my habit of explaining peculiarities of my family away because here, when you say your family was once British, it tends to come across as if you're trying to establish an air of authority, superiority.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my British wife has anxiety about her place here, because she went to a high school where most of the students were American expats upset about the fact that they were expats ( so they picked on anything that wasn't American--like her ). She came away from that school sincerely believing that Americans are strongly anti-British. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, she gets subtle benefits all the time in the US owing to people's hearts going all fluttery when strangers hear her accent.</p>
<p>The Brits used to be in charge and--at least inasmuch as interactions in daily life inside the US are concerned, that still matters. So much so that claiming British heritage in the US when you're not literally British in the present tense is a little like claiming aristocracy when everyone can plainly see you're not aristocratic. </p>
<p>For better or worse. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I suppose I am well-suited to answer, as my mother was English.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>English is sort of the default origin. It is just not remarkable in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was never a huge 19th century immigration wave, like with so many other immigrant communities. So, there was never really a time when immigrants from the UK were living as a seperate community.</p>
</li>
<li>Most Americans of English origin have ancestors that have been in the US for so many generations that it isn't really meaningful.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I were to claim my &quot;English-American&quot; heritage, I'd feel pretty fake about it. The last of my English ancestors came here before 1800 and the vast majority arrived between the 1650s and the 1770s. There's no real connection there for me.</p>
<p>My wife on the other hand is half Swedish, half Irish. Her immigrant ancestors were her great-grandparents. It's a lot more tangible for her. Her parents knew them. There are still pictures and other momentos from them around the family. It's still a big deal in her family. </p>
<p>Plus there were a few of my ancestors of English heritage who fought in the Revolution, so I doubt they wanted to identify as &quot;English-American&quot; after that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
