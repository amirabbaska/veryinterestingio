		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one answered yet, I'll tell you a bit (I work in a Sleep clinic).  I don't have much time, so I'll keep it truly ELI5.  </p>
<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> We are not supposed to talk in our sleep, so when it does happen it's cause something is going wrong.  And usually the reason it is happening is because of the body's failure to keep the body completely and entirely paralyzed.  </p>
<p>It most of the time takes place during the part of sleep where we more often dream (i.e. REM sleep). During this time, you body is supposed to <em>actively</em> paralyze <em>all</em> your voluntary muscles (i.e. &quot;skeletal muscles&quot;). In other words, your body is making sure you can't move, primarily, it is thought, to make sure you don't act out your dreams.  Probably so you don't kill/hurt yourself pretending to do various things.  </p>
<p>With many people, this active paralysis isn't as complete as it should be.  So occasionally people talk.  But since talking isn't per se that dangerous, there's probably not a lot of pressure for it to be eliminated (throughout the many generations of people).  </p>
<p>Most people who talk, usually don't say very much or say it very clearly/coherently.  And usually only talk briefly.  Those people who seem to have full conversations/speech/confessions are few and far in between.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science is very much a work in progress. We aren't sure why humans sleep, let alone why we dream. Some suggest that while sleeping, the brain is sorting memories. The previous day is parsed, where (questionably) important information is stored and irrelevant details are forgotten. The senses sometimes attempt to interpret what the brain is doing, resulting in a dream. </p>
<p>Usually while asleep, the body's muscles are locked so that you don't act out your dream. Sometimes this fails, and you sleep walk or sleep talk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sleep your brain releases <a href="https://www.livescience.com/21653-brain-chemicals-sleep-paralysis.html" target="_blank">chemicals</a> which block your body from carrying out the actions from your dream.  When this process is a too strong you get sleep paralysis (you wake up and can't move) when the process is too weak you talk and walk (and punch and kick) in your sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is also known as 'somniloquy', it occurs to some poeple during both the REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep phases. When it happens during REM sleep which is the stage during which we dream the mouth and vocal cords, usually inactive when we're sleeping, briefly gets activated, and the words spoken by one's character in a dream are spoken out loud. This usually only occurs during momentarily overlapping states of consciousness and lasts only a few seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have changes in the level of norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus, a group of neurons located in the caudal pons, which is part of the brainstem.  This nucleus keeps you still at night while you dream so you (as a caveman) don't attract nocturnal predators while you are helpless.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
