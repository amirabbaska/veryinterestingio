		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's to avoid lawsuits. If you produce - lets say - potato crisps in a facility that also roasts peanuts (very common in causing allergic reactions), you can't technically make sure that in the whole production chain, any contamination of the crisps with peanuts is ruled out entirely. This does not mean that you will find peanuts in your crisp bag frequently - just that it is possible to happen eventually, for example because crisps bags and peanut bags are packed in the same factory hall, and people who work with packed peanuts might work with packed potato chips too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you’re in the US, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodallergens/ucm530854.htm" target="_blank">It’s required by the FDA</a> to list all possible allergens. Many food companies produce multiple items in the same place, so there may be a risk of cross contamination. </p>
<p>Example: Let’s say my potato chips roll down the same conveyor belt that some peanuts went down a few days ago. Even though those belts may have been sanitized, there’s still no guarantee that there isn’t a trace amount of peanut residue somewhere. </p>
<p>It’s not really to prevent lawsuits (though sometimes is used that way) but more as a general warning to the consumer. If you have a severe enough food allergy you know to be careful of what you’re eating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Products which are made/handled in facilities which handle other products which contain common allergies (nuts, soy, dairy, fish, etc) always carry the risk of cross contamination. Although every part of the process is completely cleaned between changing products the level of cross contamination which can cause an allergic reaction is so infinitesimally small that it's best to warn people to avoid their products just in case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this from direct experience from a family-owned snack food company. Food manufacturing facilities produce a huge variety of products. While great effort is taken to make things clean, the air is constantly filled with dust particles from things like peanuts, soy, wheat, etc. To prevent those with allergies from being exposed, they say “may contain…” even though the product you are eating doesn’t contain those items in the ingredient list.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
