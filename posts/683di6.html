		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the Latin word for &quot;and&quot;, which is &quot;et&quot;. If you combine the &quot;E&quot; and the &quot;t&quot; you get something that sort of looks like a modern ampersand. After years of use and changing cursive styles, we ended up with the modern ampersand. You can see how the form changed over the years in this picture: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#/media/File:Historical_ampersand_evolution.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#/media/File:Historical_ampersand_evolution.svg</a></p>
<p>The origin of the word &quot;ampersand&quot; is interesting too. The character used to be included at the end of the English alphabet, so it would be recited by schoolchildren. And people also used to say &quot;<em>per se</em> _____&quot; when referring to a letter that could also be a word. For example, you might say &quot;<em>per se</em> i&quot; so as to not confuse people that you're referring to yourself or that you mean &quot;eye.&quot; As a result, schoolchildren would say &quot;and <em>per se</em> and&quot; when they got to the end of the alphabet, which often got slurred to &quot;ampersand&quot; the same way children now often think it's &quot;Olive the other reindeer&quot; (instead of &quot;all of&quot;) or they pledge allegiance to the flag and &quot;The Republic Forwhichistan&quot; (instead of &quot;for which it stands&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The ampersand can be traced back to the 1st century A.D. and the Old Roman cursive, in which the letters E and T occasionally were written together to form a ligature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the time of medieval Latin, paper was super expensive, so to save space, there were many symbols which were used to shorten writing. Some for common endings or prefixes (like con-/com- or -ibus, which were actually the same symbol for some reason), some for whole words. Et was written in a single symbol, the Tironian et. This symbol was the ancestor of the modern ampersand.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this is also the origin of the ˜ in both Spanish and Portuguese. The only difference is where exactly they put the mark (before vs on vs after the affected sound). Now in Spanish, it indicates palatalization of the consonant*, and in Portuguese, nasalization of the vowel.</p>
<p>*Palatalization is sort of like adding a y before the vowel. It's very common in Russian, where any consonant can be palatized depending on the vowel after it. For a good example of palatalization, think either the Russian word for 'no': 'нет' /n^(j)et/ or any Spanish word with the ñ, I'm sure you can think of examples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to another dimension, in writing there are nuanced differences between &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;and&quot; particularly in the area of attribution to works.  The ampersand is generally applied with persons work in tandem with one another, where as the word &quot;and&quot; is used when different people worked on a project, but not as a collaborative effort.  So, say Bob and Jim are writing a script for a movie, and then Chris comes along and does a rewrite, and Steve cleans it all up before final approval.  The script writers would be listed as: Bob &amp; Jim and Chris and Steve. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
