In Destin's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fTC_Ud_k3U" target="_blank">new video</a>, they go as far as building a <em>handheld Tesla coil gun</em>, filming their experiments with his high speed camera. </p>
<p>Destin and Cameron, as well as our physics and engineering panelists, will be around throughout the day to answer your questions about all things Tesla coily!</p></div></div>

I have experience with DC high voltage detonator circuitry.  HV AC is a brave new world for me, so I'm eager to learn.  Cameron Prince (u/teslauniverse), the guy that runs www.teslauniverse.com is going to be in this thread as well.  He is the real guru that can answer technical questions about the circuitry and Nikola Tesla in general.  I've asked him to answer questions by providing references to Tesla documentation he's accumulated over the years when appropriate.  One question I'd like to start with myself is <strong><em>&quot;Why does the bolt just go out into air and not physically touch the ground?&quot;</em></strong>  What is happening there?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On the safety bit, part of the reason the answers vary so much are because each answer depends on a lot of things.  The biggest is whether your skin is intact.  The level of resistance offered to the current path with unbroken skin is much higher than if you have an open wound where it starts to drop to basically the same level of resistance that water would offer.  And when dealing with super high voltage, as it is ionizing things near its path, the resistance also changes.  So the easiest answer is always &quot;don't shoot yourself with lightning bolts!&quot;  Plus the special grounding strap boots he had was an interesting thing for you to show!</p>
<p>I had a great time watching you have fun.  Keep it up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
