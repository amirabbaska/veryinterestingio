		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical load on a power system is controlled at the generator which compensates for changing loads by adjusting speed and excitation voltage to the generator field. Since most commercial generators are so large these increases in load at such a small scale are inconsequential but if say 1 million people turned on a light at once then the electrician operating the power plant would notice and one of two things would happen either the generator(s) online would increase fuel to the generator(s) to maintain speed or excitation voltage would automatically increase to accommodate the increased load. Or the Electricians can start and parallel in another generator or connect another power plant into the grid if they are producing more power than it is using. In short you turning on a light is a carefully monitored and controlled dance run by thousands of people nation wide, Texas is the only state in the continental US that is not permanently connected to the national power grid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to store power but this is expensive. When we are talking about the second to second variations in power output and input to the grid the energy is stored in the turbine blades in the power plants which works like flywheels. Similarly any three phase engine common in industrial applications connected directly to the grid will also work as a flywheel and help smooth out the power consumption. So when you switch on a light the power might come from your washing machine.</p>
<p>This is actually a problem in the future as wind turbines and solar panels generally do not have a big flywheel directly on the grid as traditional power plants do. So we may in the future have big flywheels installed to better smooth out the demand for power. Or we might come up with a system of capacitors or batteries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere on the grid, a power station really does adjust its output. Since the adjustments cannot be quite so precise as adjusting for a single light bulb, the amount of power on the grid is allowed to fluctuate slightly -- which is visible as a slight variation in voltage or frequency seen by thousands of users.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a unit of one, your house's power usage varies wildly and is somewhat unpredictable. </p>
<p>As the unit of your residential city block of 20 homes, the small variations in personal schedules cancel out and power usage is more statistically stable.</p>
<p>As the unit of your neighborhood of 10000 homes and 100 small businesses, the variations are even smaller.</p>
<p>As a unit of your city of a million residents and businesses, the profile of consumer is pretty steady and predicable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible by allowing some variation in the voltage, if we have 230V supplying 100 light bulbs just fine, and you turn on another one, they'll all share a little bit less power, but they're ok with that.
If your lamp is only glowing at 99% potential it's also only consuming 99%, so you're not paying that extra 1% either. But at the power station they'll soon notice that they are now a bit low so they crank up the power a bit so they can sell you and all the other 100 light bulb users another 1% of power.</p>
<p>It's not just for selling they do it though, that was just for the ELI5 ;), they need to provide a somewhat stable voltage, they'd also decrease the production if the voltage went up 1% because someone switched off a lamp, they need to keep as close to the baseline as possible to be able to handle variations in any direction as well as possible.</p>
<p>I heard (saw actually.. on Discovery Channel I think) that one of the most challenging situations like this for the power companies in UK are when a big football game ends, and all the britts go to boil their tea water, it produces a huge spike in the power consumption that is really difficult to respond to with the generators, so all power companies need to follow the game to be ready to respond and predict exactly when this peak will happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
