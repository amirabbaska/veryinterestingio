You aren't actually seeing grey or varying shades of black, but dots getting smaller and further apart to create the illusion of grey tones.</p>
<p>The image was then transferred to a plate, right along with the type, that was then inked and the image transferred to the paper by pressing the inked plate against it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An earlier method would actually engrave lines into a soft metal plate.</p>
<p>In high school, I worked at the local weekly paper ... the paper used linotypes up until about 1971 or so.  My job was to lube the Linotypes, break down the chases of type of that week's edition, melt down the type slugs into ingots for the LinoTypes, cast the stereotyped ads for the coming edition, and generally clean the place out.</p>
<p>For photos, they had a small lathe.  On one end, you wrapped the photo around the lathe cylinder.  On the other end of the cylinder, you wrapped a sheet of soft metal.</p>
<p>The end with the photo had a photocell to sense light and dark areas.  The other end had a pin-type cutter.   For dark areas, the cutter cut less deeply, lighter more so.  </p>
<p>Then you turned the machine on.  A screw drive advanced the cutter and photocell along the length of the lathe.  When it hit the end, you had a print ready photo engraving. </p>
<p>This also worked with sending images over the telephone or telegraph lines ... kind of like an early FAX machine.</p>
<p>An old newsreel clip (ca 1937) showing the technology ... </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthb8d_u1Kg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthb8d_u1Kg</a></p>
<p>The machine demo starts at about 3:40.</p>
<p>Important international news photos would often have a cut-line, &quot;AP WirePhoto&quot; to impress you with the news organization's global reach.  Like in the 60's when a grainy, blurred news clip from somewhere else on the planet would have the overlay, &quot;Live, via satellite.&quot;</p>
<p>When the local paper went to the offset printing process, we started using the half-tone process.<br />
For display advertising, the ad agency would send us heavy cardboard mats with the text and images pressed into the cardboard.  These were called stereotypes.  We would use those to cast a thin sheet of lead holding the image and text.  The images were made using the half-tone process.</p>
<p>Halftoning used a rather expensive chemical etching process to make the image. It did make for much higher quality images used in book printing.</p>
<p>The photo lathe was pretty cheap and easy to run.</p>
<p>Dang, looks like that company is still in business,

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newspaper photos are still printed with halftones today. Halftones are a relatively recent technology, began to be widely used in newspapers in the 30s I think. Halftones are not feasible with metal type, what few pictures early newspapers contained were metal engravings. I haven't seen the movie and don't know what &quot;early days of newspaper&quot; means here exactly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for context, The Post is not set in &quot;the early days of newspapers.&quot; Papers have been printed for more than 300 years, images have been printed in papers for nearly as long. Halftone printing has been used in papers for almost 150 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they would create an entire plate with the picture (Either by chemically engraving (photos) or physically engraving (drawings) it into a plate, then often casting from it (to reverse the engraving and preserve the original) to produce basically the equivalent of a huge movable metal type block. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
