		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, males tend to be larger when they have to compete for access to mates.  Larger animals tend to win in conflicts, so larger males tend to win in conflicts for access to females.  They may also be more attractive to females.  Male size gets &quot;inflated&quot; above what would otherwise be selected for.  </p>
<p>In mammals, male competition for access to females is relatively common, so large males are relatively common.</p>
<p>Females tend to be larger when large size is important for maximizing female  reproductive output.  In species where the female produces large numbers of offspring, being larger means more offspring means higher fitness. For example, a larger female fish might pump out 100000 eggs while a smaller female of the species might only make 10000.  This causes &quot;inflation&quot; of female size over what would otherwise be favored. Larger females are relatively common in fish, reptiles, and amphibians, but rare in mammals.  Mammals use maternal care, and female fitness is limited more by the number of babies she can <em>care for</em> than the number she can produce.  Females need to be at a size where they can efficiently forage and evade predators, which means not abnormally big. So larger females in mammals are rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mammals typically live in groups, and males typically compete for mates.  Both this competition and the need to defend territory and protect the group leads to natural/sexual selection favoring typically larger males.  A larger male can defend against threats better, can fight other males for mating rights better, and females who want to choose the best mates will favor them.</p>
<p>Females don't have as much luxury in being able to grow larger/stronger/etc., because their bodies' effort goes more towards rearing children.  A male only has to survive long enough to bang, basically, so his body can be large, energy-hungry, and shorter-lived.  A female has to be able to devote a significant chink of her effort and nutrition and time into raising young.</p>
<p>(Note this doesn't hold true always, or as a blanket rule.  It's how it works out for many species, but the ins and outs of sexual dimorphism go way deeper than this.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure it's true that they are often smaller than males. There are many species where females are larger than males. The Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" target="_blank">sexual dimorphism</a> has some examples of both.</p>
<p>A species will evolve one way or the other (or with no sexual dimorphism at all) based on what works best for their niche. In some species the females are larger because it's advantageous for them to be larger to carry the fetus, as you said. In others the male is larger because that is the trait that appeals to females, so females select larger males as mates. There isn't really one broad answer, the reasons are different for every type of animal (and some plants).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Female mammals are often smaller than males of the same species due to sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>Sexual dimorphism is when physical characteristics other than genitals differ between the males and females of a species. Sexual dimorphism is part of the sexual selection process for many animals, including most primates. </p>
<p>The characteristic difference can include differences in coloring, size, body shape, etc. </p>
<p>The fact that the male individuals of many species of animals are larger on average than the females suggests an evolutionary advantage of that size differential in the sexual selection process. Meaning that males of larger body size within a species are more likely to mate and thus successfully pass on their genes due to factors related to their size. This could include female attraction for larger males, body size being an advantage in fighting for mates, harem behavior, nest protection, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The males of species look how the females want them to, evolutionarily speaking the peacocks ostentatious tail would be a dead end except it impresses peahens.</p>
<p>It's not so much survival of the fittest as much as it's breeding of the fittest.  And fittest is usually just what the females want males to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
