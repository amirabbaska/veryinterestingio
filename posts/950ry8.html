		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crossbows have a big disadvantage due to having short limbs compared to a bow. This is true for all types of bow, but it has to be balanced with how unwieldy it would be to have a huge longbow or crossbow.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is the length of the power stroke. A fairly typical archer will have a draw length (the distance between the drawn string and the back of the bow) on their bow of about 27-31 inches, and a brace height (the distance between the undrawn string and the back of the bow) of about 6-8 inches. This gives you a power stroke of somewhere in the 19-25 inch range. Most crossbows have a power stroke somewhere in the 9-13 inch range. That dramatically reduces the amount of time the string is imparting force on the arrow. That's how you can have an arrow flying the same speed as a bolt despite having a much lower draw weight.</p>
<p>There's also a penalty in efficiency for having short limbs that affect crossbows. All bows have a draw force curve that shows how much force the string is imparting compared to how far it is drawn back. In a typical longbow, this curve is shaped like an upward facing banana. That means that when it is barely drawn, almost no force is imparted, and as you draw it farther the force increases more and more. The flatter the curve, the more efficient because the force on the arrow isn't dropping off as much during the power stroke. Having longer limbs gives you a flatter curve, which is why longbows are so long. So, the crossbow with its very short limbs has the force drop off very quickly, giving less speed for the same amount of force.</p>
<p>Finally, since crossbows need to have a lot more initial force to make up for the inefficiencies we've already talked about, they have to have shorter, thicker, heavier bolts so the initial shock of the force doesn't destroy them. Heavy bolts also need more fletching to straighten their flight path. The short, thick bolts are much less aerodynamic than the longer, skinnier arrows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The weight of the bolt is probably the most important factor here. A common, modern crossbow bolt can be in the 500 grain area (about 31 grams), whereas a common, modern arrow is usually in the 300 grain area (about 19 grams). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crossbows are inefficient at making the arrow actually fly fast.</p>
<p>A 500-pound crossbow hits about as hard as 150-pound longbow.</p>
<p>This is largely because the crossbow is so short. Just like the short barrel of a carbine compared to the long barrel of a marksman's rifle, the weapon is pushing on the projectile for a shorter period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume youre comparing bows and crossbows with equal draw weights in which case your statement is true but an added benefit of crossbows is that you can use drawweights that are impossible with a traditional bow. A crossbow uses cocking aids to draw the string back to its firing position which if using a rope cocker gives a 2 to 1 mechanical advantage and then there are crank aids which make it possible to draw a crossbow string back with one hand. My Crossbow has a D.W of 260 lbs so while the bolt is heavier and shorter the added energy of a crossbow more than makes up for it. Here's some numbers on record distances <a href="https://www.archerytalk.com/vb/showthread.php?t=1642040#/topics/1642040" target="_blank">https://www.archerytalk.com/vb/showthread.php?t=1642040#/topics/1642040</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
