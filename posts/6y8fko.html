		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among living things, fractal geometry significantly increases surface area, which is important any time an organism needs to collect or exchange very small things, like photons or gas particles. As these branching structures emerged, the organisms that embodied them had a competitive advantage over rivals that didn't exhibit this trait.</p>
<p>Moreover, structures grow at a cellular level, and small structures require less resources to produce than large ones, but these small structures can grow, work in aggregate, or both to support larger structures. Thus, a sequoia seed can germinate with sufficient resources to yield a seedling, but it would be impossible for that seed to embody the energy and resources to suddenly sprout a giant sequoia. The seedling applied the branching strategy and thereby accumulates the resources to grow.</p>
<p>Branching also provides insurance against injury, predation, parasites, etc. If the seedling starts with two leaves, gets trampled and loses one, it's still a viable organism.</p>
<p>In hydrology, branching works in reverse (except when it doesn't). We'll start with the reverse: Water collects in a small depression, and starts to flow downhill. Eventually, it encounters water from elsewhere also running downhill. This combined water has more energy and mass and can displace more soil, and eventually join other channels. The river is the combination of the endless tiny movements of water uphill.</p>
<p>The river's delta, however, reverses this in a sense. As the water loses energy, it becomes less able to displace sediments, and channels get smaller, dropping sediment that variously impedes the flow of water; it creates obstructions that water behind it can't move, and must flow around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both ferns and ice crystals grow as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" target="_blank">fractals</a>.  The idea is that if you're scaling something (adding a leaf to a fern, expanding an ice crystal), you're always following roughly the same rules: &quot;What's easy to get to from here?&quot; and &quot;How far away do I need to be from the last thing before I add a new thing?&quot; and &quot;Which way is the sun?&quot;, for example. If you apply the same rule each step, you'll get recognizable patterns throughout each level of the thing you're looking at.  If the rules are similar enough to each other, the end results will look similar (like lightning and rivers).</p>
<p>Dust on your window might form in fractal patterns because the tiny static particles are following specific rules of sticking to certain surfaces and avoiding others.  Rivers might spread in fractal patterns because the soil has a specific tendency to erode into forming one big river up until a certain point, when you'll see a fork split.  Again, the reason for the rules might change, but they lead to common rules about splitting off vs. making something bigger, usually based on distance and rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface area is a major factor in the form of organic things like plants, trees, ice crystals, lightning strikes, etc. The familiar branching pattern you see is slightly altered depending on the medium something is traveling through (water, air, dirt) but is much more effective at spreading force, soaking up nutrients, or whatever in that type of formation than, say, one long string or a disc like shape.</p>
<p>Additionally, things that grow (live organisms) as well as minerals and Lichtenstein figures (lightning branching patterns) are interactions involving a few key organic molecules. Atoms can only attach to each other at certain angles, and this probably affects the way organic molecules both grow themselves as well as how energy moves around them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is <strong>amazingly interesting</strong>. It has to do with scale, efficiency, and<strong> an extra dimension</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: nature often finds the mathematically maximized or minimized solution to certain questions. Minimize surface area to volume ratio - <strong>sphere</strong>. Maximize surface area to volume ratio - <strong>fractal</strong> (branching self similar pattern). </p>
<h1>Extra dimensions</h1>
<p><strong>Wait what? 4 dimensions?</strong> Yeah <em>sort of</em>... This is gonna get deep. Fractals are <em>weird</em>. They sort behave as if they add an extra dimension, mathematically. </p>
<p>The best way I can help you to understand this is with coastlines and weird questions about 4D spheres. </p>
<p>What is the length of the coastline of Iceland? Which country in Europe has the largest coastline? These seem like questions with straightforward answers but for centuries, mapmakers got different answers and couldn't explain why. The issue is that coastlines are fractals and asking about their length is asking a 1D question (length) about something that behaves as though it has an extra dimension. </p>
<p>Imagine a sphere. Now let's ask a question that makes sense about a sphere what's the volume? What's the surface area? We can find formulas to answer these questions. </p>
<p>Now let's ask a question that doesn't seem like it makes sense about a sphere. What is the <strong>total area of the interior?</strong> this doesn't seem like it makes sense because there can't be an area of a three-dimensional object could there?</p>
<p>If we imagine the sphere as a infinite series of two dimensional circles in three-dimensional space, in other words, as slices of a sphere sitting on top of each other, then we can say what the area of each of these slices and add them together.</p>
<p>Since there's an infinite number of these circles the surface area is infinite. Sometimes when you ask a question that applies to an object of a higher number of Dimensions you end up with infinity as the answer. Area is a 2-D question and I asked about a 3D shape, so I got infinity. </p>
<p>What if I told you that there was a real two dimensional shape that can be no wider than a quarter but has an infinite perimeter? The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank">Koch snowflake</a> is a fractal that can be defined so that the perimeter is infinite, just as if we were asking a 1D question about a property of a 2D object. </p>
<p>This is very similar to the discovery of the coastline problem in map making. Depending on how small you let your smallest measurement be, the coastline gets longer. </p>
<p>The branching nature of our cardiovascular system is similar. It isn't infinite but it is almost like an extra dimension. Even though we're only a couple of metres tall, our cardiovascular system has a surface area larger than a tennis court. <strong>We're bigger on the inside. </strong></p>
<h2>Where <em>is</em> the Extra Dimension?</h2>
<p><strong>it is a what not a where </strong>
Some dimensions are <em>where</em> dimensions like left, right, up and down. Some are what dimensions like pressure, time (sort of) or volume. The thing being increased in a fractal is information over scale. In order to define a fractal, I need to cheat. The information for the fractal isn't stored in the shape, it is in the definition. I need to give you an algorithm. And the shape actually changes depending on the resolution that you choose to measure it. If you change the scale or resolution, you change the shape because the shape is defined <em>in terms</em> or its resolution or scale. </p>
<h1>More applications</h1>
<p>Let me make it even more interesting: Branching structures let us predict things about animals with those structures</p>
<p>I can predict the LIFESPAN of a species the size of a whale or a wombat based on its weight before I measure it. Lifespanwill scale to WEIGHT^(1/4). That's the one-quarter power. Remember that (1/4) power for later. It's not just lifespan but you can use weight to predict:</p>
<ul>
<li>metabolism (how many calories the animal needs per day)</li>
<li>heart rate</li>
<li>brain size compared to intelligence</li>
<li>required oxygen</li>
<li>number of offspring over lifespan</li>
</ul>
<p>All for the average animal of that given size. </p>
<p>But it isn't only true of animals. It works for trees. It's true of similar features of organizations like ant colonies or publicly traded corporations. It even true of cities. The pace of life is faster in larger cities and you can predict by how much and the lifespan of a company based on size of organization. They are both exponential on average. </p>
<h1>Answering the question</h1>
<p>So... <strong>why does this happen</strong>?</p>
<p>What's common between mice, elephants, humans, trees, and even cities to some degree?</p>
<p>They all need resources delivered to every part of their structure.
As mass scales up, you have to deliver blood (oxygen and nutrients) to every single cell in the body. Once you have a <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, you have a branching series of tubes that have to go to every single cell, the same way that every road has to be able to deliver a piece of mail to every single address. Each road (including driveways) has to meet or end in a house. This is basically a fractal - a repeating self-similar structure that looks the same at every scale (like the branches of a tree). </p>
<p>As animals scale up, this structure gets more efficient. There is a 25% savings that you get with scale (1/4 power). Highways can go faster than local roads and the more highways you can build the better you are at delivering things. </p>
<p>This 4 from the 1/4 power is better described as 3+1. 3 for the three spatial dimensions we scale in and 1 for the fractal nature of the structure - the extra dimension. </p>
<p>Animals scale in 3-Dimensions and the fractal nature of our cardiovascular system scales in 4. We end up with a 1/4 extra bonus efficiency at scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
