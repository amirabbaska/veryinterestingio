They claim that you only have to pay a small fraction back. How the heck does that work? Borrow a ton of money and only pay a small fraction back? I don't understand how that would work. Thanks for any replies!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT - 4/2/18</strong> - WOW! This really blew up fast! Thanks for all the replies, the big lesson that I learned from this is NOT to get into debt that I can't pay back! Thanks everyone!</p></div></div>

<p>So let's say you owe your credit card companies $25,623 and you don't really have any way of paying that back. You might file bankruptcy, and the credit card companies would get little or nothing. OR they could agree to take $5,000 and just give up on the rest. This is probably a better option than forcing you into bankruptcy, because $5,000 &gt; $0. </p>
<p>So these companies work with your credit card companies and other creditors to arrange a settlement. It usually looks like them paying $5,000 to the credit card company to wipe out the debt, and then you end up paying them $6,000 over time, so they make money too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey, one I can answer... worked for a bank for over a decade, used to do credit bureau disputes.</p>
<p>Depends on the quality of the company. And most of the time they’re misleading.</p>
<p>The bigger companies usually do settlements. That is, you owe say, 5k, and they get us to take 2k. That could be before or after your account is charged off.</p>
<p>What they aren’t advertising on the phone is that this is going to negatively impact your credit. Now, if they’ve already charged off the account as a loss, the hit isn’t going to be that bad. Gets reported as settled, paid after charge off. Not too bad. A prospective creditor will see you had some trouble, but paid on it after a charge off.</p>
<p>If the account has not charged off, and the bank settles, it gets reported as settled, then charged off. Which is a little worse. A prospective creditor will look at that as you basically saying ‘I can’t pay anymore, but here’s a little bit.’ These are rare. Most of the time, the creditor is going to wait for the person to charge off. Why? Because people would do this more often if they weren’t in trouble. Just call in and claim some emergency to get a lower payoff.</p>
<p>Any time we’re dealing with debt management, if you’re account was open, it’s automatically closed, and will report closed by grantor. Also keep in mind that you’re going to receive a 1099 form on any debt that’s settled. If you settled that earlier mentioned 5k for 2k, that 3k counts as income for tax purposes. Sure, you could try and not report it at tax time, but that’s a risk you’re running.</p>
<p>As per the shadier companies... They’re a pain in the ass. A lot of them will send us documents that accounts were opened fraudulently. Whether you told them that or not. I’ve seen ever thing from repeated form letters claiming fraud to phony police reports, some from real agencies, others from agencies that don’t even exist. Some will threaten to sue for basically nothing, with no details. Just threatening ‘attorney’ letters demanding we remove delinquencies or stop reporting accounts.</p>
<p>Long story short, don’t expect a miracle. If you have valid delinquencies, the banks aren’t going to remove them. When you go onto TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian’s websites and dispute negative marks- oh, did I mention you can and should do this yourself? Saves $$$- those disputes go to the banks to review via a system called e-OSCAR. The bureaus themselves, they don’t review shit.</p>
<p>The same goes for trying to settle. Try dealing with the banks yourself. No sense in paying someone else money that you could be using to get back on your feet to settle your debts. In most cases, if you get into a lot of debt due to some trouble you find yourself in, consider bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Please don’t think of that as some nasty, evil word. Or that we at the bank are looking down on you. We recognize that shit happens. The only people we get annoyed at are the people that blast out their cards on purpose, then refuse to pay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can work out a settlement directly with your cc company without going thru a third party. The damage to your credit report is done when your bills are reported as late. If you were to file bankruptcy when your bills were still paid up to date, your credit score will not take as much of a hit. The third party settlement companies are a scam and will eventually hurt your credit more than helping. They’ll take your payments and hold on to the money til the account is about to charge off, then make a settlement. Meanwhile, you’ll still be getting collection calls, etc.  Also, a settlement is viewed as (almost) just as bad as bankruptcy. If you qualify for a chapter 7, that’s the way to go to save the most money.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these companies are just rip offs. Here's the deal, if you are broke and can't pay your bills, you have two options. Wait until your creditors start suing you and garnishing your wages and attaching your bank accounts or file for bankruptcy. Only 25% of your income can be garnished, so if you owe a lot of money, they aren't going to get much back.</p>
<p>But you can also negotiate with creditors to reduce the amount you pay back. Many times they will stop charging you interest and penalties and let you pay back the money you owe with no further accumulations.  You can lower the amount you pay back. It's all just a negotiation. You can do it yourself, or hire one of these companies. to negotiate for you. </p>
<p>But these companies make no promises, you have to pay in advance, and in the end, you can't force them to do anything, so you just lose you money and probably file bankruptcy. But you can do the same negotiation yourself. Show your creditors you are close to filing bankruptcy and they will get more out of you settling than in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>But it still screws your credit until you get them paid off, to whatever you agreed to. So if you are a great negotiator and have a lot of time, you can try to do it yourself. But most companies don't really have a reason to talk to you or someone you hire to negotiate for you. I mean, they will talk, but they just say &quot;see you in court&quot;.</p>
<p>I recommend trying yourself to negotiate with creditors and if that don't work, hire a bankruptcy lawyer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
