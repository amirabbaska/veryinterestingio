		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay well I'm late to the party so this won't go anywhere, but I see a lot of okay answers, a lot of speculative answers, and a lot of dangerous answers.  As a former airline pilot, let me try to break the issues into a few categories:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Interference to navigational equipment.  As others have said, a cell phone could potentially cause a minor deflection on navigational equipment.  Where this becomes most relevant is in the landing phase, especially in bad weather.  What I think most people don't understand is exactly how precise the instruments are.   </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of how close the instruments bring an airplane in to landing:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What's called category 1: a layer of clouds 200 feet above the airport and 1/2 mile forward visibility. This is able to be flown manually by the pilot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OJkq1_omwg" target="_blank">Here's a video to show you how little time you have to react once you can see the ground</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's called category 2: a layer of clouds 100 feet above the airport and 1/4 mile forward visibility. The approach is typically flown by autopilot now but manually landed.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d0cIM_1vZ4" target="_blank">Here's a video to show what that looks like</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>What's called category 3: For all intents and purposes this is no visibility. This is fully automated.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV_vWtAJIow" target="_blank">Here's a look</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, to give you an idea, these systems are putting an airplane travelling at nearly 175 MPH onto a piece of pavement that is generally 150 feet wide. The localizer, which is a component of the Instrument Landing System (the ILS some others have mentioned)  shoots a beam which does this laterally. At the runway's end, this beam is 750 feet wide.   </p>
<p>That means that in the cockpit, if the indicator is even a little off, you're going to land in the grass.  </p>
<p>And if you land in the grass, you're gonna have a bad day.   </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As others mentioned, there is radio interference.  Hearing the cell phone clicks over the headphones could cause the pilots to miss valuable instructions from air traffic control, which could lead to you flying into a mountain or another airplane.<br />
And if you fly into a mountain, you're gonna have a bad time.   </p>
</li>
<li>But the most important thing that people ignore here is SCALE.  Sure, one person may leave their cell phone on for a flight in good weather conditions, but if you had 150 cell phones on during a flight, the navigational error may be larger.  It may not matter on most days, when the weather is not an obstacle and approaches are done &quot;visually&quot; with the pilot navigating to the runway by just using his eyes, but it will matter when you get into the bad weather that you see in the videos above.  </li>
</ol>
<p>And to all of those who said &quot;Well I leave my cell phone on and I have never crashed&quot; you should really rethink your strategy.  If I eat raw chicken and don't get salmonella, does it mean that you can't get salmonella from eating raw chicken?  <strong>NO IT MEANS YOU GOT LUCKY.</strong>  And so if you want to gamble on your plane not crashing so that you can get that extra three minutes of text messages in (because as others have noted, signal is garbage at altitude because of tower switching), then keep in mind there are hundreds of other passengers on the airplane who would prefer to probably live their life.  The idea of text messages vs a 1/10000000 chance of dying being an acceptable trade off is an embarrassing state of our society.   </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold, but really, I would encourage you do go do something better with your money like gamble on monkey knife fights or something.  </p>
<p>Edit 2: seriously, stop with the gold nonsense.  </p>
<p>Also people have accused me of scaremongering: rest assured the odds of crashing are incredibly small and a cell phone won't increase it that dramatically, I just have to emphasize to the &quot;WELL, I CAN USE MY PHONE BECAUSE THE RULES DONT APPLY TO ME&quot; crowd that the rules exist for a reason. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pilot. The concern by the FAA is that certain electronic devices (like cell phones) have electronic components which may interfere with the VOR receivers that many airplanes used to use to navigate the U.S. airspace, as well as the ILS receivers used to help airplanes navigate towards the landing strip. This is done through an overabundance of caution; normally there is no interference, though we did have one airplane in our flying club where a cell phone did screw up the VOR receiver. (The electronics on that older radio were not properly shielded.)</p>
<p>If you are navigating by VOR and the VOR receiver is off, it's pretty easy to get lost up there.</p>
<p>Nowadays with almost everyone using GPS to navigate, there is less of a concern, though <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/13/travel/southwest-plane-wrong-airport/index.html" target="_blank">airplane pilots still do occasionally get lost and land at the wrong airport.</a></p>
<p>It's in large part why you used to have to turn off all electronics below 10,000 feet: because that's generally during the approach or takeoff period where you are using the ILS receiver to guide you to the landing strip (and through potential obstacles like mountains and tall buildings), and in areas like Los Angeles, where there are tall mountains where navigation is vitally important. (Also, when there is a problem the airplane becomes a glider; the lower you are the less time the pilot has to deal with the emergency, so there is less margin for error when you're below 10,000 feet.)</p>
<p>(Edit: Holy cow, I didn't expect to get this much response! Goodbye, mailbox!)</p>
<p>(Edit 2: So I forgot to define my terms. Which makes sense because I had no idea this post would take off.</p>
<p>&quot;VOR&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range" target="_blank">VHF Omni Directional Range.</a> It's a type of navigation aid which transmits a signal that can be received by a special receiver in an airplane, that allows you to determine your angle relative to the VOR transmitter. Using two VOR transmitters at separate locations a pilot can (in theory, if he remembers how) determine his location by using two separate VOR receivers.</p>
<p>&quot;ILS&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system" target="_blank">Instrument landing system;</a> it's a special transmitter which allows a pilot to determine his relative location to the landing path he needs to follow to land on a runway. The ILS system transmits two signals; one which allows a receiver to determine his relative angle horizontally to the landing path; the second determines his relative height above or below an ideal glide path. It's commonly used by commercial pilots to help glide their aircraft to the touch-down point on the runway, and is used by pilots flying in instrument conditions (where you can't see anything outside the window) to land successfully.</p>
<p>Also I see a lot of comments talking about &quot;well, if this is true, why doesn't the FAA do this or do that?&quot;</p>
<p>My two responses are:</p>
<p>(1) You're expecting the FAA to make sense? Optimism.</p>
<p>(2) Remember: the FAA isn't happy until no-one is happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mythbusters did some limited tests on this. Problem was the FAA wouldn't let them do it on a flight, so all results with a pinch of salt. </p>
<p>What they found between experiments and research is that yes, mobile phone signals can indeed interfere with aircraft instruments. More-so older aircraft since newer ones have much better shielding. </p>
<p>However, given the huge number of planes in service, of varying age (so no guarantee the shielding is still intact) multiplied by all the different phones coming out with 3G/4G/H/Bluetooth/Hyperwave it is utterly impractical to test all phones on all planes in all conditions to be sure that it is safe. So, the default option is to tell people to turn devices off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pilot. While usually cell phones don't affect our instrumentation (anymore, this wasn't always the case), I can definitely tell if someone in first class (or in the cockpit haha) has their phone on because as soon as we get low enough for them to have service, I will hear a bunch of clicks in my headset if they get a message or something. It's mildly distracting but nothing else. I know that doesn't really answer your question </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>10 years ago, did you ever put your iPhone too close to a computer speaker or radio alarm clock?  If you did, you could hear this series of tones and clicks as the phone talked with the towers over GSM.  I never thought much about it until my flight instructor didn't turn off his phone during a cross country trip.  When his phone started talking to the tower those tones were magnified over my head set to the point where they were almost painful.
Loud and obnoxious. None of the instrumentation seemed to be affected, though.  Most phones are better made and talk on different frequencies now, so not anywhere close to being the same annoyance.  But, none of that 10 year old tech is gone.  Most of us have moved past it but it is all still around and somebody could bring one of these old phones onto a plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
