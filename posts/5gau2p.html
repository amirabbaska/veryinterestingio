		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A computer screen is made up of pixels. There is no single LED/crystal/light source that can display all the colors you want represented as a single piece.  Instead, there are multiple sub-pixels in each pixel.  The most common is to have one Red, one Green, and one Blue (RGB).  They adjust the relative brightness of each sub-pixel to mix RGB colors into the final color you want.</p>
<p>The sub-pixels are all meshed together in grid pattern.  Something like</p>
<pre><code>  R
G  B</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, each pixel is surrounded by a mask to prevent the light from one pixel bleeding into the next.</p>
<p>Each pixel is optimized to cast light forward, towards you, the viewer.  Imagine you had 3 christmas lights, red green and blue, at the back of a toilet paper tube.  If you were looking directly at it, you could see all 3, producing a white light effect.  As you tilt the tube, there comes a point where one is blocked, and then a point where 2 are blocked, changing what color of light you would perceive at each point.</p>
<p>That is essentially what is happening when you look at a flatscreen from outside its optimum viewing angle.  The mask around each pixel is blocking one or more of the sub-pixels from your vision, preventing you from seeing that part of the color.  Different flatscreen technologies (TN vs. IPS vs. AMOLED) and different production qualities within each of those will result in different optimum viewing angles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light coming at a flat angle from the screen has passed through a thicker layer of liquid crystal than intended, and is thus more rotated. Colors that were supposed to be blocked may thus pass, and colors that were supposed to pass are thus blocked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure this topic can be ELI5'd, but here goes a very cursory explanation:</p>
<p>Because an LCD has a white backlight, and the RGB is created by filters.  Those filters are turned off, on, and anywhere between by varying electricity to them.</p>
<p>When you view it at an angle, you're looking through the crystals in a way you aren't supposed to.</p>
<p>Those filters are sort of bars like a bunch of window blinds polarized either vertically or horizontally.  Since your eyes are horizontally arranged, most screens are set up to avoid having this effect from left to right, because then your eyes would see different colors all the time.</p>
<p>Now that we understand that, why is a different color?  The little crystals are diverting the light you shouldn't see at different angles so when you see that other light, it's the opposite color of what it should be.  Sort of.  It's kind of complicated, lol.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically copying someone else's reply from when this was asked last time. </p>
<p>Look through a toilet paper roll, you will see what's behind it no problem. </p>
<p>Now look from a different angle, you can't see directly behind it, you can only see the inner side of the roll, which reflects some of the light. </p>
<p>The light of course won't be as clear as when you look directly through the roll. </p>
<p>Imagine your monitor as thousands of tiny paper rolls, when you look directly at it, you see through the rolls. When you look at it from an angle, you see inner sides of the rolls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
