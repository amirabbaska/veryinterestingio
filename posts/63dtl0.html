		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - Taken from previous <a href="https://redd.it/mlct5" target="_blank">thread</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leonardo Da Vinci painted it. He is the foremost Renaissance artist. Artist's credibility adds to the paintings popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte hung the painting in his master bedroom in 1800. This - I think - was the first tipping point of making the painting one of the most popular paintings in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1804, Mona Lisa is hung in the Louvre - and others can now glimpse at the painting that Napoleon slept with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the real tipping point for the paintings popularity only hit in August of 1911 - when Mona Lisa is stolen. Stolen from heavily secured Louvre which experts said was impossible. No one knows who stole it or how. Conspiracy theories abound. The painting is talked about in every newspaper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 2 weeks of much fan fare, Police arrest Guillaume Apollinaire on suspicion of theft. He is the only person they have arrested. Apollinaire implicates Pablo Picasso. The rumor of Picasso stealing the Mona Lisa adds in a lot more fuel in making Mona Lisa very very popular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picasso is questioned and released. Guillaume Apollinaire himself is released after 5 days. Everyone is still clueless as to who stole the painting. But conspiracy theories abound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two years after the theft, the Mona Lisa is finally found when an employee working at Louvre tries to sell it to an art gallery in Florence for $100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Mona Lisa is returned to the Louvre, it draws massive crowds. People visit the Louvre only to see this one painting.</p>
</li>
<li>And then it hit the Paris Hilton effect. Its popularity added to its popularity. So much so that most people don't know why it is popular in the first place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legitimate history and origins aside, the &quot;aura&quot; around the Mona Lisa reminds me of this excerpt from DeLillo's <em>White Noise</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the most photographed barn in America.  We drove 22 miles into the country around Farmington.  There were meadows and apple orchards.  White fences trailed through the rolling fields.  Soon the sign started appearing.  THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA.  We counted five signs before we reached the site.  There were 40 cars and a tour bus in the makeshift lot.  We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing.  All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits.  A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot.  We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers.  Murray maintained a prolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book. </p>
<p>&quot;No one sees the barn,&quot; he said finally. </p>
<p>A long silence followed. </p>
<p>&quot;Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.&quot;</p>
<p>He fell silent once more.  People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced by others.</p>
<p>We're not here to capture an image, we're here to maintain one. Every photograph reinforces the aura.  Can you feel it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies.&quot; </p>
<p>There was an extended silence.  The man in the booth sold postcards and slides. </p>
<p>&quot;Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender.  We see only what the others see.  The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future.  We've agreed to be part of a collective perception.  It literally colors our vision.  A religious experience in a way, like all tourism.&quot; </p>
<p>Another silence ensued. </p>
<p>&quot;They are taking pictures of taking pictures,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>He did not speak for a while.  We listened to the incessant clicking of shutter release buttons, the rustling crank of levers that advanced the film. </p>
<p>&quot;What was the barn like before it was photographed?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What did it look like, how was it different from the other barns, how was it similar to other barns?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The 'Mona Lisa' wasn't even the most famous painting in its gallery, let alone in the Louvre,&quot; Zug says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was 28 hours, they say, until anyone even noticed the four bare hooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of a sudden, James Zug says, &quot;the 'Mona Lisa' becomes this incredibly famous painting â€” literally overnight.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the Louvre announced the theft, newspapers all over the world ran headlines about the missing masterpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>After a weeklong shutdown, the Louvre re-opened to mobs of people, Franz Kafka among them, all rushing to see the empty spot that had become a &quot;mark of shame&quot; for Parisians.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody talked about the Mona Lisa before 1911; it was not popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was stolen in 1911, but not noticed the entire day (28 hours). </p>
<p>Once the theft was reported all over the world (which shows what a big deal it was back then before the Internet or even television), overnight mobs of people became interested and wanted to see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heist put it into the public consciousness in a very dramatic way, lifted it out of obscurity and became immediately famous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> One day nobody knows anything about the Mona Lisa, the next day it's <strong>stolen</strong> and everyone has to see it. Over a hundred years later it's the most famous painting in the world, but nobody remembers why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leonardo's border-free painting that achieved depth and shading through many layers upon layers was a revolutionary technique that had previously been unheard of and quickly became used by other artists after the Mona Lisa was finished.</p>
<p>Leonardo's existing fame plus the painting's innovative brilliance made it instantly famous, but it wouldn't become the &quot;most famous painting in world history&quot; until the painting's own history made it legendary. The painting was stolen and nobody knows how or by who so the rumors and suspicions around it gave it more and more attention, and then when it was finally recovered people from all over flocked to see it at the Louvre to see what was so special about this painting they'd heard about. </p>
<p>Then people heard about massive crowds at the Louvre and decided they must see for themselves, so on and so forth. Da Vinci himself even continues to gain fame every few years or so when someone tries out one of his centuries-old sketches and makes it actually work, then the internet goes into a frenzy researching the man and inevitably comes across the painting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Or you could add that this portrait masterfully employed, amongst many other techniques, a technique known as 'sfumato' which essentially means blending and tricks the eye so you cannot perceive where one carefully layered detail ends and another begins, like how smoky eyeshadow can create visually pleasing and strangely captivating eye-candy.</p>
<p>The big idea here is that the painting masterfully incorporates and utilizes numerous effects and styles and is representative of pretty much everything a good portrait painting of that period can or should possess. </p>
