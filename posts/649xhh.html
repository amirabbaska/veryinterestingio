		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the assumption is that we'll pay for it when we get to the register.  There is a SLIGHT chance that you open something and get to the cash register and oops, it turns out that you don't have enough money after all. But that happens so rarely it's not worth being vigilant about. </p>
<p>Much better to trust your customers, and reap the benefits of that trusting relationship, than to be suspicious of everyone who comes int. </p>
<p>In my life, it's much more about an extremely unhappy child. (I have a special-needs toddler who sometimes just cannot deal.) Yes, I could let him scream until we have paid and are out of the store. But it's far, far less upsetting for everyone if I can hand him a graham cracker now, which will keep him quiet and happy. I can explain when I get to the register if needed.</p>
<p>It's a little more complex if we're using a self-service checkout that goes by weight. But again, anyplace we go, they probably have seen us before and trust that we're not trying to get away with stealing three grapes, or one graham cracker. </p>
<p>The kind of theft a supermarket is worried about involves higher-ticket items. Alcohol, medicine, razor blades, condoms, meat. A couple of grapes or a few cookies is negligible, even if we WERE trying to get away with stealing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically it isn't but stores choose to &quot;allow&quot; it. Sometimes if a person is grocery shopping and is hungry, the store will overlook the customer consuming as long as they are properly paid for. But security will nab you the moment you head towards the door without paying</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>US Midwest, it's not really as okay as it seems. Most stores will allow it without too much fuss (since we have the 'customer is always right' mantra), but it's still seen as a pretty trashy thing to do, an adult will get subtly looked down upon for doing it. It's usually only done for fussy kids, and more often than not it's punctuated with casual apologies and &quot;it's fine&quot;s when you hit the register. Of course, I worked at a grocery store, so I'm not sure what the big retailer people have to put up with, and it might depend a lot on the store and region in question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
