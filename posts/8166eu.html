		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  But we also have to consider the opportunity cost of paying down the balance immediately.   </p>
<p>If the money used to pay down the loan could have been used in a way that it generates more &quot;return&quot; (lack of word choice) than the interest on the loan, the buyer could come out ahead.   Say for example, the money could have been deposited in a savings account or certificate of deposit that paid at a higher interest rate.</p>
<p>Likewise, paying down the balance immediately could place a huge financial burden on the buyer.  If the end up having to take out loans on credit cards or other loans (which nearly universally will have a higher interest rate than a mortgage), the buyer could take a loss by paying the house in full. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They call it opportunity cost. If you plunk down lots of cash all at once, that money can't be used to invest in something that earns a greater return. So, when car manufacturers offer 0% or 1.9% interest, you're betting that you can manage your money to earn more than 0% or 1.9% over the 5 year term of the loan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the market. With low returns on bonds, you'd have to be careful that you were getting a better rate than you were paying.</p>
<p>Say you're at a 3% on the car, but bonds are doing 2%. Seems like it'd make more sense to buy the car. But if you can get 0.9% on the car, you're good. That's just quick down and dirty.</p>
<p>You also have to weigh the risk of depreciation and an accident. You have to think about where you could potentially get a better rate. Bonds vs. stocks, etc.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I needed a new car, and I had 20k sitting around, I'd put the 20k in a retirement fund of some sort 99 out of 100 times just due to my situation.</p>
<p>I've worked at making my credit look polished and I have a decent paying career. My last car was financed at 0.9% and only cost like $500 or so over the life of the loan to finance, and I paid it off early. So I mean, yeah, I could have saved $500 over 5 years (Whoopty shit) or made (assuming about 3% growth annually over the same 5 years) about 3k.</p>
<p>That's why you invest instead of paying off the car in full. Now, things change if you're in different circumstances of course.</p>
<p>TL; DR: Invest the money, don't buy the car outright. Because compound interest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This applies to me:</p>
<p>Let's say mortgage was 3.5%. My retirement accounts over a 15 year period were showing returns around 7% if not higher.</p>
<p>So over the 15 years of my mortgage every $1,000 I put extra on my mortgage would save me $35 a year. But every $1,000 I put into my retirement accounts made me $70.</p>
<p>Therefore say 150k over 15 year mortgage. with 20% down. I pay $34,414.63 in interest.</p>
<p>But if I start at $0, and put that $1,000 extra into my retirement accounts every month, at the end of 15 years I have: $131,104.76 in <strong>GAINS</strong> plus $180,000 in my contributions.</p>
<p>Minus the interest I had a net gain of $96,690.13 enough to purchase another (smaller) house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
