		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a considerable amount of compelling evidence, which happens to be intimately bound to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics#Development_of_the_theory" target="_blank">development of the notion of continental drift and then of plate tectonics back</a> in Wegener's days, so let's start there.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=xogEaAfvsnsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=wegener+continent&amp;ots=i5snRzmv8h&amp;sig=O1l4HwS214ZrW50tWUxRxwqqw8I#v=onepage&amp;q=wegener%20continent&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Wegener suggested that continents had drifted over time</a>. He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Evidence_of_continental_drift" target="_blank">evidence to support this</a>, but no mechanism to explain it, this came about 50 years later (we'll get back to that). What Wegener noted was that the coastlines on either side of the Atlantic fit a lot better than any random process could account for, pretty much like jigsaw pieces. He also noted that if one brought back N &amp; S America against western Europe and Africa, several geological units would be in continuity one with the other and that this also extended to the distribution of the fossil fauna and flora. This made for a pretty compelling case that those 4 major continents once were united as one, but at that time nobody knew how this could have come about with a mechanism which could account for this motion.</p>
<p>Exploration of the ocean in the 50's and 60's brought forth some new and unsuspected data which allowed to flesh out a mechanism which might account for the movement of continents (see: <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZlQABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Hs√º, K. J. (2014). Challenger at sea: a ship that revolutionized earth science. Princeton University Press.</a>). It was noted that the middle of the Atlantic was the site of a massive chain of volcanos and of seismic activity which followed the jigsaw outline of the coasts on either side, and that rocks on both sides of this volcanic ridge showed a symmetrical pattern of progressively increasing ages and magnetic polarity patterns as one moved from the ridge to the coasts. It was also noted that continental margins bordered by mountain chains were often the location of exceptionally deep trenches (e.g. the Marianas), volcanism (ring of fire) and seismicity. What was puzzled out was that new material was constantly being injected between the separating continents from the volcanic ridge (divergent margins), moving them progressively apart over time. And that at the same time, older material was being reintroduced into the mantle to melt and be recycled along convergent margins. This was revolutionary, and completely transformed our understanding of geology. </p>
<p>Since then, a lot of effort has been expended in generating <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/ess403/ESS_403/Lectures_files/ThirdWeekLectures.pdf" target="_blank">paleomagnetic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology" target="_blank">geochronologic</a> data to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_polar_wander" target="_blank">pole wandering path</a> trajectories for each given site and backtrack from the current position to the original one for any give time. On the basis of the pole wander paths, we can produce <a href="http://www.scotese.com/" target="_blank">paleogeographic maps</a> which show the position of given continental blocks for a given time. It is in a large part of the basis of these maps and the underlying data that our understanding of Pangaea is built. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've also got things like tears in the ground from iceberg movement being in exactly the same direction and age in different continents, similar fossils of land mammals in Antarctica, Australia africa and South America. Finally rock types can correlate between different continents a long border. We did about it in geography A2 (last year of English school if you aren't English) And the evidence is quite compelling</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
