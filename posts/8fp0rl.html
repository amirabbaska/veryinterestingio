<p>Yes, it’s possible. There are case reports of people developing mania due to intracranial disruption, but it is quite rare. In these cases the patients described were euthymic - in other words, they were not depressed - but it illustrates the point that both extremes of mood can develop as a response to intracranial injury, whether it be due to mass effect (tumor), stroke, or traumatic injury. I don’t know of any cases that fit exactly your hypothetical case - someone who is pre-morbidly depressed and subsequently becomes euthymic or even hypomanic/manic as a result of intracranial mass - but it is presumably true in theory if specific areas of the brain are disrupted. I actually saw a case in medical school of a woman with a chronic history of treatment-resistant depression who was found to have a massive meningioma - a type of relatively benign brain tumor - in her frontal lobe. After the mass was (mostly) resected, her mood improved almost immediately though with the downside that she became much more impulsive and irritable - not unexpected effects given the area of the brain that was being operated on.</p>
<p>I’m a little unsatisfied with some of the answers here as some are flat-out incorrect while others do not accurately describe the state of the science. It is quite clear that depression is not due to a “serotonin deficiency.” Disruption in serotonin signaling is sufficient but not necessary to cause depression - the antidepressant Wellbutrin (bupropion) has essentially zero serotonergic activity but is fairly effective as an antidepressant. Further, researchers have created markedly serotonin-deficient strains of mice and they do not reliably develop the symptoms of depression typically observed in mouse models. Instead, it is more likely that there is generalized disruption in the monoamine system, which includes serotonin but also norepinephrine and dopamine. Apart from the SSRIs, most other antidepressants act on multiple components of the monoamine system. It’s also possible that disruptions in monoamine signaling are simply a downstream effect of dysregulation. We just don’t know based on the science. What is quite clear, however, is that the overly simplified explanation  popular in the lay media and our culture broadly of a “chemical imbalance” due to serotonin is not correct. </p>
<p>Further, while the neuroscientific basis of mood is not known exactly, there are pretty clear circuits and neuroanatomical structures that are involved in mood regulation, and disruption of these structures - either intentionally in animal models or accidentally in human patients - reliably results in mood symptoms. These structures largely include specific areas of the frontal lobes but there are others. I’m reminded of another case that I saw in residency while working on the epilepsy monitoring unit when a guy was being worked up for possible resection of an epileptogenic focus, basically a part of the brain that was not correctly regulated and would occasionally become hyperactive, resulting in a spread of electrical activity across the brain that caused a seizure. As part of this work-up, neurosurgeons place a bunch of very small electrodes within the brain to very precisely locate the epileptogenic focus. The electrodes can discharge a minute amount of electric charge, resulting in stimulation of a very specific part of the brain. This is done to see what the function of that specific area of the brain is and, thus, determine whether it can be safely resected or not. Anyway, as the team was doing this testing, activation of one of electrodes resulted in a marked and sudden change in the man’s mood. He immediately became acutely depressed: he had no interest in doing anything, his voice became monotone and soft, and he just looked depressed (what we call a flat affect). This effect disappeared after a few minutes with stimulation of other areas of the brain using other electrodes. While anecdotal, this is the most clear demonstration of the fact that our experience of mood is dependent entirely on the functioning of the physical brain. </p>
<p>So, the short answer to your question is that I would say that it’s possible, but I know of no cases that have specifically described this phenomenon. The long answer is that our experience of mood, and consciousness broadly, is based on the functioning of the brain, so it should be unsurprising that disruptions in the structure of the brain can result in changes in your mood state. While we may not know the exact mechanisms by which regulation and generation occurs, they are better described and less mysterious than other answers provided here.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with answering this question is that we don't have a good understanding of the mechanisms of depression, biologically speaking. Theoretically, the disruption a tumour causes could well lead to changes which improve emotional wellbeing, seeing as we couldn't say for certain what disruption causes the opposite. However it's also worth remembering that depression and other emotional impacts of brain cancer could also be more directly related to the patient's situation (i.e. their poor prognosis and the stress of having the illness)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A tumor causing or reversing depression would be very rare. Generally people who have brain tumors are depressed because of their potentially life threatening disease and the anxiety that comes with impending mortality. The prevalence is around 27% and can differ significantly based on tumor size and even country (Oncotarget. 2017 Aug 3;8(55):94932-94943. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.19843. eCollection 2017 Nov 7.)</p>
<p>However there is some data suggesting that if certain white matter tracts are disrupted, it can lead to affective changes (World Neurosurg. 2015 Oct;84(4):927-32. doi: 10.1016/j.wneu.2015.05.031.). Generally that's not a presenting symptom. Tumors are typically found because of seizures, headaches, visual changes, weakness or abnormal sensation.</p>
<p>In terms of structural changes reversing depression, there is some home that deep brain stimulation may help. However, the large trials have not yet showed a significant benefit and it is still considered investigational. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I’ve had several patients with underlying brain tumors who, for better or worse, experienced the elation and euphoria of mania secondary to their brain tumor. Of course, it wouldn’t be expected for them to remain as such. I’ve also had several frontotemporal dementia patients who had elevated moods most days, but that came at the cost of lacking insight (anosognosia). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
