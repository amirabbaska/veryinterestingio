<p>If someone is hypothetically in a position where they don't have any deadlines associated with their work so they just sleep whenever they're tired... For example 4 hours here, 10 hours there, 2 or 3 naps one day, more sleep than necessary the next, etc. Is that any more or less beneficial than forcing yourself into a routine that doesn't feel natural?</p>
<p>In other words, I understand we train children growing up to sleep according to a specific schedule, but I wonder if that is simply a product of a functioning society or if it is actually good for you physiologically? It seems like the body naturally wants to shift the cycle, and that we have to force ourselves into consistency.</p></div></div>

<p>‘My sleep was perfect! My body chose by itself when to sleep and when to eat. That’s very important. We showed that my sleep/wake cycle was not twenty-four hours, like people have on the surface on the earth, but slightly longer—about twenty-four hours and thirty minutes. But the important thing is that we proved that there was an internal clock independent of the natural terrestrial day/night cycle.’</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reality is that it is a little bit of both.  Artificial light has undoubtedly changed our sleeping patterns, but the body is a master at adaptation and compensation.  </p>
<p>Early humans did not follow the same sleeping patterns as modern humans.  How many animals out there that you know sleep in solid blocks of time for many hours?  Even animals that sleep for 16+ hours rarely if ever sleep all of those hours at once.  This is a huge evolutionary disadvantage to be unconscious for that long for the vast majority of animals.  Even hibernating bears are not truly asleep for long periods of time.  Early humans were no exception and many experts agree we had some sort of bi- or poly-phasic sleep cycle.</p>
<p>Is the modern sleep schedule objectively worse?  It is hard to say.  Again, the body is a master at adaptation and for the most part, modern humans have adapted to our new sleep schedules.  This is evident by the way hormone levels fluctuate throughout the day and night.  Hormones are your body's way of regulating various processes throughout the day and have natural peaks and lulls.  They often align with a person's Circadian Rhythm in healthy individuals.  Of particular interest are the hormones ghrelin and human growth factor.  The former closely follows a person's sleep and dietary conditions whereas the latter seems to favor a strict time frame during the night.  This sheds light on the ability of the body to adjust certain hormone production based on variability in sleep and diet.</p>
<p>While small fluctuations in sleep patters may not have had major effects, complete reversals of those patterns can lead to significant changes in physiology.  It has been shown in various studies that people working in night shifts are more likely to suffer from a variety of diseases and their overall level of concentration is not as high as a diurnal individual.  This is too much of a shift in a human's natural sleep cycle for the body to adequately compensate.</p>
<p>Some sleep therapists recommend that you explore your natural Circadian Rhythm.  Contrary to popular belief, a healthy individual can adjust their rhythm within reasonable limits.  As long as you are mostly diurnal, you will not likely see many negative effects <em>as long as you are consistent.</em>  By far the main cause of negative sleep effects are from constantly shifting sleeping patterns, rather than the patterns themselves because your body and hormone levels need time to adjust.  Perfect example of this is jet lag and drastic changes in time zones.  As long as you are consistent and allow your body to adjust, it will adapt a completely new sleeping pattern, albeit a diurnal one to your new location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that natural sleep patterns in humans is supposed to be bi-modal.  We sleep for a time, wake up and are active for an hour or so at night, then sleep again.  Before the industrial age started, people would sleep a first sleep or 'dead sleep' and then wake up and be active, even visiting each other, and then have a second sleep.  Most of what you will read about sleep health is going to be filtered against the 8 hour sleep period we imposed in order to be good, productive workers (make the wealthy owners more wealthy).   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having a regular sleep schedule is an important part of <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips" target="_blank">sleep hygiene</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day sets the body’s &quot;internal clock&quot; to expect sleep at a certain time night after night. Try to stick as closely as possible to your routine on weekends to avoid a Monday morning sleep hangover. Waking up at the same time each day is the very best way to set your clock, and even if you did not sleep well the night before, the extra sleep drive will help you consolidate sleep the following night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400203/" target="_blank">a study that questioned some other aspects of sleep hygiene principles and strategies</a> generally acknowledges the value of sleep timing regularity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Homeostatic sleep drive and the circadian system work together to promote stable patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Sleep duration and continuity are worsened when the primary sleep episode is advanced (i.e., shifted earlier) or delayed (shifted later) from one's habitual timing of sleep, such as changes in sleep patterns associated with jet lag or rotating shift work ... In addition, irregular bed- and wake-times increase inter-night variability in sleep timing which, in turn, results in desynchrony between sleep-wake timing and other endogenous circadian rhythms. In clinical populations, research has suggested that individuals with insomnia have more inter-night variability in sleep timing and self-reported and actigraphy-assessed sleep characteristics....</p>
<p>Several studies of nonclinical adult populations have examined the association between sleep timing regularity and sleep.... these data typically suggest that irregular sleep schedules are associated with greater daytime sleepiness and worse self-reported sleep quality ...</p>
<p>In sum, the evidence demonstrates a clear association between sleep schedule irregularity and sleep problems ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just finished reading Mr. Walker's <em>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams</em>. (Matthew Walker is the director of Berkeley's Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab.) The book covers the cycles and stages of sleep, which involve complex factors that affect every body process. Poor sleep hygiene even contributes to higher cancer and heart attack risks. His No. 1 recommendation for healthy sleep is to stick to a sleep schedule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
