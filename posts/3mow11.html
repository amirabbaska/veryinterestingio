If we have found running water would this make us more likely to increase our interest in the planet? If so, why? Will it enable us to possibly answer questions about ourselves and our own planet? If so, what questions? What will it mean for space exploration? How will it change or enhance our understanding of the greater universe? </p>
<p>I'm aware that it would be a monumental achievement and that running water is considered something of a holy grail in terms of finding it in space, but I'm unsure of why and of what it could mean to find it. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to answer.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard to say without the specifics. The implications of such a hypothetical announcement would be quite different depending on on how and where the data was obtained, and what are the particulars.</p>
<p>A couple of key questions to keep in mind are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is this permanent &quot;flowing water&quot; (highly unlikely) or intermittent/episodic (probable);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are we talking about a dynamic system hinting at some sort of active hydrosphere  (momentous), active geologically-driven hydrothermalism (Very cool) or is a passive system where episodic melting releases water from a fossil source such as permafrost (cool);</p>
</li>
<li>What is this water of which we speak? Is it freshwater? Saline? Hypersaline? What about pH? The source of the info will limit the possibilities to adress this, but it matters. The fact that someone closely connected to HiRISE is part of the announcement makes me suspect there would be little compositional data available in such an announcement if your hypothesis is correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we'll see. I'll be waiting for the actual announcement; I'm curious to see what it is myself!</p>
<p>EDIT/UPDATE: So! It's Ã©pisodically flowing brines loaded with perchlorates after all! No specific source has been identified, so all options are open as to what exactly is going on here. To come back on my previous statement, I'd say this falls in the &quot;pretty cool&quot; range, for quite salty values of cool...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A big thing people don't seem to be considering is that now we know there's salt water on Mars, NASA has cause to begin funding research on how to make salt water usable, most likely leading to massive strides in that kind of technology, which will help us on earth when fresh water becomes scarce. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It's just plain cool news;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It tells us that planets have a lot of secrets that we won't discover without actually landing (robotically or with humans) and literally digging for clues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It increases the possibility that there is or was life on Mars;</p>
</li>
<li>It gives us that much more of a reason to send actual humans to Mars.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as it's not done Capricorn One style, that is.  ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the points I'm not seeing addressed much by other good answers is that for the longest time it was assumed that liquid water just might not exist very often at all outside Earth.  Now, we're finding water in all sorts of places as our technology improves.</p>
<p>Every time we discover extraterrestrial water, it raises the expected likelihood that water is a common thing in the universe, which in turn greatly skews the equations when it comes to guessing regarding life-bearing planets elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>Imagine a different discovery.  Right now, we see life as incredibly, unbelievably rare.  But what if we (magically) discovered evidence of life on an exoplanet?  If it pops up close enough for us to have discovered it in the first place, then there's a sudden immense shift in the probability that the galaxy is actually teeming with life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can see three big implications of liquid water being found today on Mars.</p>
<p><em>Life</em> - <em>everywhere</em> on Earth where there is water, there is life.  If we found a source of liquid water on Mars the odds of finding current life on Mars goes up a lot.  It doesn't mean there is life there, though.</p>
<p><em>Us</em> - If we send people to Mars for science, industry, or settlement, having a sourse of water on the planet means we don't need to bring as much water with us when we go, and water weighs a <em>lot</em> so it would allow us to get to Mars cheaper and/or faster.</p>
<p><em>Fuel</em> - water is just oxygen and hydrogen.  Use some electricity and a compressor and you have rocket fuel.  Just like not needing to bring as much water to keep the astronauts alive we wouldn't have to bring as much fuel to get the first visitors back home, which again means a cheaper and/or faster journey to Mars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
