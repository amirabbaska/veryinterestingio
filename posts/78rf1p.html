		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To a certain extent large scale electrical brain rhythms that are disrupted by action are also disrupted by &quot;motor imagery&quot; (search on that term if you want the literature), e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811905025140" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811905025140</a></p>
<p>There's even some evidence that we can get better at motor actions by mentally practicing! e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452205011541" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452205011541</a></p>
<p>Mirror neurons are sometimes a useful model, but there's a lot to indicate that they're a bit too convenient e.g. <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2009.21189" target="_blank">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2009.21189</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On mobile, so apologies for brevity and any weird formatting. </p>
<p>There's a research group doing fMRI scans of people in persistent vegetative states. They ask them personal questions and have them think of playing tennis to respond &quot;yes&quot; and think of walking through their homes to respond &quot;no&quot;. The former activates motor regions of the brain, while the latter activates memory processing regions (hippocampus). Through this technique, they've been able to identity signs of consciousness in people thought to be totally brain dead. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2330" target="_blank">Here is a review article about that work</a>. It's pay-walled, but if you don't have access, just google fMRI persistent vegetative state tennis, and you'll find lots of pop science press about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
