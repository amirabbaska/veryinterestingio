		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Florescent light works by having electrons pass from one electrode to the other. This forms what is called an &quot;arc&quot;.</p>
<p>To get the lamp started you need a spike of high voltage to get the arc started. Older lamps used a starter to get the lamp going. Modern lamps use pulse start which is done by components within the ballast.</p>
<p>The delay start is to build up the high voltage to complete the initial arc. More details and illustration <a href="http://www.edisontechcenter.org/Fluorescent.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers so far, just one thing I think was left out.</p>
<p>As to why it flickers a lot when turned on is because the gas inside is cold. When cold it takes a lot more energy to create the glow discharge.</p>
<p>So the starter tries to start it, gets a short discharge that quickly goes away but also warms the gas. It tries again, better discharge, more heat, still goes away though. Repeat.</p>
<p>Eventually the gas is hot enough for a stable discharge and it's properly lit up.</p>
<p>This is why if you turn it off and then on mere seconds later, it lights up right away without flickering. There's no need to heat up the gas first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lighting tech here, there are a couple other things that were left out. There is a difference between a rapid start and instant start ballast and you will see a slow start up from the rapid start. Further, on larger lamps (looking at you F96t12 and above) you can often see a 'strobe' effect when it first starts up, which can be mitigated by taking the lamp and holding it straight up and down, then rotating 360 degrees slowly. There is a bead of mercury in there and this rotation causes it to coat the inside of the lamp better, allowing for a smoother start. </p>
<p>Finally, if you have strobe issues, it can also indicate a poor connection in the socket or tombstone, often caused by wear over the years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrical component sends a charge into the bulb, sending electricity throughout the ionized gass contained within the bulb, this conducts electricity and causes the bulb to glow. The electric current excites the murcury vapor in the electrically charged gas that produces a short wave ultra violet light that coats the inside of the bulb to (a phosphor) producing the visible glow you see. That s my not getting into it at this hour when im already too manic lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends really. I do led retrofitting and sometimes floros will start up faster than the led's I replace them with. It depends what kind of ballast the floros are using and some are 'instant start'.</p>
<p>Floro's tend to require several hundred volts to ignite the gas inside hence the ballast which takes the 120v-277v in an office setting and bumps it closer to 400v and higher. This doesn't actually require a pause to initiate, but sometimes starters are used (which essentially heat the electrodes in the tubes for a more 'robust' start). Sometimes ballasts don't actually fire up instantly either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
