		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife slipped into her coma on Dec 24 and finally came out of the intensive care unit on March 15.  She ended up in her coma because of sepsis (we were never able to find a cause of the sepsis), which can be a bit different than many of the trauma caused comas we hear so much about.</p>
<p>In that time, she says she only remembers two &quot;dreams&quot;.  One was related to one of our grand daughters and a toy she brought into the unit once, and the other was about how mean the nurses were by not giving her a coffee when that was all she wanted.  I believe both these happened during a time where she started to come out of the coma in February, and was lucid for a period of time before going back into the coma.</p>
<p>As to what happens to the patient during that time is hard for me to remember, from an emotional time.  She had to be put on a ventilator and many other pieces of equipment to monitor her vitals.  Her body basically gave out and needed to have dialysis because her kidneys were not working.  She was on very high level of various drugs to keep her blood pressure up as she kept losing her blood pressure, even from something as simple as a nurse trying to listen to her lungs.  It was a long period of time and many things were done, but suffice it to say, they worked.</p>
<p>She was a very sick woman for a very long time.  After she came out of the ICU, she was put into a step down ward for a few days before being admitted to a rehabilitation ward for a few weeks.  You see after being in the coma for that long, she had no muscle strength to speak of.  She could not even scratch her own nose in the rehab ward for the first day or two.  In rehabilitation, she worked hard to regain her strength through physio and just working on her own.  Around April 10, we had a trial run for a weekend to see if she was able to cope at home, but man, was it hard.  She slid out of an easy chair while I was out putting the sprinklers on, and could not get back up, or into the chair.  She did as she was taught, crawled to the bed and used it as leverage to pull herself up.  But was she ever angry at me for not being there when she needed me.  She ended up with another couple of weeks of the rehab ward, then came home.  To add insult to injury, her first night home at the dinner table, I noticed her eye and mouth drooping.  My mind instantly went to stroke.  Thankfully it was Bells Palsy and not a stroke.</p>
<p>Here we are 17 years later.  She still insists the only two memories in the ICU were the two I mentioned earlier.  She said it was weird waking up and finding out so much had happened in the world around us, but other than that had no recollection of time during the period in the ICU.</p>
<p>She is not the same lady she was before the coma.  Her memory, especially short term, has been effected, but she is smart, and has developed many strategies to cope with that.  She also has lung problems, which she never had before hand.  Nobody is able to give us answers on why, but I suspect it is because of being on a ventilator for so long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago my father wound up in a coma due to his insulin pump. He apparently got up in the middle of the night, told it he was going to eat something and went back to bed without eating, and it dosed him while he slept.  </p>
<p>He was in the coma in the ICU for about a month and it is nothing like the movies/TV. He did not suddenly &quot;wake up&quot; as if from sleep one day. It took days for my mother and I to convince the nurses/doctors he was even responding to stimuli at all, they were trying to convince us he was just being kept breathing by the machine but we were SURE he would try to squeeze our hands ever so faintly, and try but fail to open his eye, but I was certain that when I spoke from one side of the room or the other I could see under his eyelid, his eye move toward the direction of the sound, very very slowly. </p>
<p>It seemed like such a nonsense thing to &quot;notice&quot; and the nurses and the doctors wanted to hear nothing of it, but when it's your Dad who they want to pull the plug on you become the sentinel. </p>
<p>Then he started to make small noises again everyone said they were involuntary but they seemed to be in response to my Mom and I talking to him. </p>
<p>Finally one day he managed to open one of his eyelids enough that we could see his eye and we went yelling down the hallway fore a nurse to see it herself before he closed it. Once she did their entire demeanor/standard of care changed. Instead of keeping a corpse alive and trying to say nice things to us they were telling us to keep talking to him and to keep coming in and bringing things from home and talking to him about those things and leaving them there. </p>
<p>Over the course of 2 more weeks he slowly...very slowly regained more motor function, but did not always gain conscious control over those functions right away. Example, his legs would just kind of do their own thing and shove his blankets away, his arm would reach out and swat stuff away and tangle up is IV  and such. </p>
<p>Once he was finally ok enough to sort of control his body and move around he was still not the same. He could not remember things, He swore things that never happened before, had happened, he had been an auto mechanic when I was a kid but for decades was a teacher but he believed he was still working for a dealership he worked at before I was even born. And he never totally healed even until the day he died (Last December right before his birthday). </p>
<p>I remember the scariest thing that happened to him a couple days after he came home, he came out of the bathroom in a panic shouting that &quot;The Bathroom says I have no legs&quot; reaching down frantically to make sure his legs were there and could feel them and we tried to understand what he was talking about, did he hear a voice? did he have a hallucination, and the more we tried to help figure out what happened the more agitated and enraged he became. </p>
<p>Weeks later I was standing in that bathroom and I realized what happened. The wall behind the sink is a mirror half the height of the wall  from the ceiling down....when you stand infront of it you see yourself... from the waist up.  </p>
<p>tl;dr Coma's are scary shit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad was in a coma for 6 weeks back in 2000.  He was 59 then, and had fell about 30 feet.  As stated before, coming out of the coma is slow process that took him about another two weeks, during about half that time, the only way you could tell he wasn't in coma, was his eyes would follow you around the room, or he would squeeze your hand.  When he finally recovered enough to have his trach ventilator replaced with one that allowed him to speak, he had to be told again that both his fathers, his biological and adoptive, who had passed away years ago, had passed away.  He was adamant that both had visited him in the hospital and had long conversations with him.  His biological father died in WWII, when he (my Dad) was 5 years old, it was sad seeing him have to process it all again.
He also claimed that he was the #1 Christian school field goal kicker in HS, no idea where that came from since he attended public schools as a kid and was never even into church, and that he had 12 John Deere tractors in various storage units around the city.  These outrageous claims would go on for about another 6 months.  The bizarre ones, like a snake in my bed, were easy to ignore but some of them made you think.  After he was moved to a rehab hospital he told me the the previous night two men came into his room and were going through the drawers and storage closet looking for anything to steal.  He said he rang the nurse, a large Jamaican woman, and she told him to &quot;shut the fuck up, or I'll cut you.&quot; </p>
<p>I haven't been on Reddit since I posted this yesterday and logged on and saw 25 replies.  I was actually scared to click at first because I didn't even remember posting it.</p>
<p>Edit - When he first actually brought up the tractors, there was a minute or so where I thought it might be real, but there is now way he could have or would made that kind of purchase.  Also, I added for clarity because some a-holes actually think my biological grandfather could have actually fought in WWII at 5 years and also been a father himself. </p>
<p>Also - He gets around pretty good now.  There are definitely lasting effects, but he's not in the worst shape for being 75.  Here he is helping with this Christmas cooking this year.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't personally know about what specifically triggers the PTSD since it usually surfaces after getting out of the ICU. I suppose it could be from whatever incident happened to get them in there in the first place, but also from simply being in there. </p>
<p>Most people don't understand what it's like to be in an ICU. I know this because we frequently have patients that are suffering and will not survive, but then families think it is no big deal to &quot;keep trying.&quot; Whenever an emergency happens while the family is in the room, and they see first hand all we have to do, they often tell me that they had no idea what it was like.</p>
<p>A real sick patient is completely powerless. Imagine lying completely motionless in bed for weeks or months. We breathe for you, suction your spit for you, cough for you (suction down your breathing tube), it feels like breathing through a straw. We feed you through a tube, tons of IVs and medications, you piss and shit through a tube, or on yourself and then we clean you up. You can't even shift your weight when your ass hurts from lying there so long, we do that for you too. You're in pain all over (imagine sleeping a long time on a shitty mattress and then your back hurts.... for months) You can't communicate so you can't ask questions about what's going on, or if we think you might live or die. (Although I ALWAYS talk to my patients and explain everything I can, because most people are actually still conscious and can hear and understand me). </p>
<p>These patients have some legit anxiety and panic attacks because of the powerlessness and lack of control that they feel. That'll definitely cause some PTSD. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During an emergency surgery at the aorta my father had several brain strokes and instead of waking up he stayed in a kind of coma-like half awake situation. He opened his eyes eventually and for a few days he was reacting to us with eye movement and blinking and even sticking out his tongue on command because these were the only body parts he seemed to be in control of. Soon these reactions faded and although every day he could move more he seemed to become more lost in his mind. He stayed in ICU for 2 months before being moved to a rehab hospital. And although the doctors and nurses were caring and nice I just hope my father didn't realise any of this! It is absolute the helplessness and depending on people... you cannot even scratch yourself if you itch let alone tell anybody if you are in serious pain or experience terrible nightmares due to your damaged brain situation.  After 8 weeks my father would react when we called his name but the reaction was pure horror.  He would stare at us as if we were monsters from whom he couldn't get away. No recognising or happy expression whatsoever. Finally we met an experienced doctor who told us there was no &quot;therapeutic goal&quot; that my father could achieve. This  was the &quot;best&quot; situation he could be in. Shortly after we were allowed to move him to a palliative station where all medication and food and water was stopped. At the first day my father closed his eyes. But it took him another 8 days to lie there still and peacefully before he finally died. We were with him all the time and talked to him and shared memories and one would always stay over night.
To everybody who asks I say he never woke up after surgery.  And I hope so much that this is true!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
