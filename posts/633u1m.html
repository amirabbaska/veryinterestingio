		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for the administration, but it's possible the idea is that the best use of taxpayer funds is to centralize Earth monitoring at the agency which has that task as its primary mission: the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. As quoted from here <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision" target="_blank">http://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision</a> --</p>
<p>NOAA's Mission: Science, Service and Stewardship</p>
<ol>
<li>To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans and coasts;</li>
<li>To share that knowledge and information with others; and</li>
<li>To conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if I were a betting man I'd guess the same amount of money will not be magically transferred from NASA to NOAA, but I have to admit on the surface of things the efficiencies in centralizing the work seem apparent.</p>
<p>If I were President, I'd likely move the spending to NOAA. In terms of NASA's involvement, NOAA would be a customer of NASA's spacelift and spacecraft developments (analogous to NGA [and others] using NRO assets to accomplish their missions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two schools of thought, and they are not mutually exclusive:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>NASA should focus their efforts &amp; their budget on outer space. Not on earth. They should be focusing on asteroids, the moon, mars, exoplanets, etc. Their job is not to study earth climate, that is the job of the EPA, and NOAA.</p>
</li>
<li>Because if NASA is not allowed to monitor earth there would be less available evidence of global warming. The evidence would still be there, it's just not available since people are not monitoring it.</li>

<p>Republicans are hostile to &quot;non-essential&quot; government spending.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because NASA's mission is space exploration, which mission has in recent years become muddled and politicized by politicians and bureaucrats trying to harness the agency's credibility to generate popular support for their agenda in regards to climate change.  By allowing NASA to go back to dealing with non-earth matters, the entire country can resume supporting it again and not viewing it as partisan.  To the extent earth climate monitoring is needed, and it is needed no doubt, there are other weather oriented agencies who can do that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
