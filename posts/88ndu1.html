		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen! When the beans are roasted, amino acids and sugars start combining and reacting, creating hundreds of new compounds that make up the smell and flavor of your coffee. There's a name for the process that I can't think of off the top of my head, something like the mallard reaction.</p>
<p>These new compounds are tasty, but delicate. Once they've been sitting in your cup getting touched all over by oxygen, they begin to oxidize. Oxidation is the process where oxygen molecules steal electrons from other molecules and they become unstable and start to decay. It's sort of like when you leave a cut apple out and it begins to brown because it's no longer protected by the outside skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides already mentioned oxidation, one specific reason that coffee left on a warming plate tastes bitter after time is because the chlorogenic acid in coffee breaks down into quinic acid, which tastes bitter. This also happens with particularly dark roasts of coffee. </p>
<p>Source: this was asked on /r/Coffee a while back and I remember this answer from a coffee expert, but double checked my terminology via Google before commenting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons. First of all, the pleasure associated with good tasting coffee is influenced by the aroma created by freshly brewed coffee, which dissipates quickly after the coffee is brewed. Also, the most common methods of brewing coffee produce coffee that contains natural oils, which degrade over time. (The Maillard reaction in coffee occurs when the coffee is roasted, not when the coffee is brewed.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
