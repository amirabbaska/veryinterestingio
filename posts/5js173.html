		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this happens on a broad scale, but I spent a few years in a college town, and there was a frozen yogurt shop on every corner. Sure enough a few times a year one would close, only to be replaced a couple weeks later by a new one. Recently I've seen the same thing happen to another shop in a different area. Is frozen yogurt that bad of a business that they can't last long? If so, why do people keep starting them up again? Or is it just a really great short-term business model, then they cash out and go?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a seasonal business that is relatively cheap to start up.  However, if you're a first time business owner there's some pitfalls that could easily sink your business. </p>
<p>Odds are the Froyo place will make 60% of its annual income over the 3 months of summer, and maybe 10% over the 3 months of winter.  </p>
<p>If the shop opened in spring, the owners would see great wealth as their business is clearly a massive success! How could the last guys get this so wrong!</p>
<p>Come fall, they've earned a vacation and take the whole family to Disneyworld! Sure it drained the company's savings, but it's making tons of money right!?!  </p>
<p>As they get back, the slow season kicks in hard.  Rent is still due every month, and that landlord is looking for $5k every month regardless of sales.  Come November they only netted $2k in profit to cover the rent, and the savings is tapped.  They start falling behind on bills and are looking for a way out.  Sales tank in December, and January/February isn't looking any better.  </p>
<p>Along comes a savior! Someone new to the business that thinks they can turn it around! For $10k and covering all past due bills, they'll buy the entire business! How could someone possibly screw up a Froyo stand! </p>
<p>Rinse, lather repeat.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually own an Orange Leaf Franchise.  The buildout on these stores is not cheap.  Ours was 112k.  Equipment new was not cheap either.  All in the store was 250k to get going.  </p>
<p>You have a loan which gets paid back in 5 years, not 30, FIVE.  That's brutal.  Meanwhile 3 years in the craze dies and you try to break even.  My store is lucky that it has been in the black each year but most aren't.</p>
<p>So people sell their store to get out from under the lease and overhead and are stuck with the remainder of their losses.</p>
<p>Someone buys the store for 100k and tries to make a go.  Good luck, if your location sucks you're screwed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of trends (fro yo, cupcakes, etc) draw a lot of me-to business owners, who may not have the skill or business savvy of others and fight an uphill battle to compete with the established players. If cash flow is tight, something that is highly seasonal can tough to keep afloat when business drops -- like, say a yogurt shop in the winter. But then somebody else comes along and see a turn-key business ready to open and they fall into the same trap, thinking they are somehow smarter than the last guy. Maybe some are, but many are not... or maybe it's something like a bad location and/or too high rent. Nobody is going to be able to cash out in a short span -- restaurants and the like are lucky to break even in years 3 or 4. So it's then going out and somebody else thinking they can do better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've owned a soft serve ice cream shop for the last 17 years.  I am open 6 months of the year.  I think the biggest reasons for the change in ownership is the low entry cost and because margins are very thin.  I profit about 2 or 3% a year and considering you would need to sell $100k just to make $3k probably helps you understand why people leave the market.  I have a full time job in addition to the business and I've been paying down a mortgage that luckily includes real estate.  Hopefully one day I can sell and end up with a decent nest egg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the case of a coworker of mine, and older couple owned the ice cream shop and wanted to retire and move to Florida.
