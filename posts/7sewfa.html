		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.irkutsk.org/baikal/animals.htm" target="_blank">Lake Baikal</a> (deepest freshwater lake) appears to have complex life forms at it's greatest depths.</p>
<p>&quot;Baikal is also home to the world's most abyssal freshwater fish. These fish have managed to preserve eyesight even at the greatest depths, although they see only in black and white.&quot;</p>
<p>Also the golomyanka (oil fish) &quot;can endure most pressure in the depths of the Baikal water. At night it rises to the water surface, and at daytime it swims down to great depths. Limnologists have had a chance to observe the golomynka's behaviour in the water depths. At a depth of 1,000-1,400 metres and more, the golomyanka moves freely both horizontally and vertically, whereas at such a depth even a cannon cannot shoot because of the enormous pressure.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are organisms that live at the bottom of the world's deepest lakes such as <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-6409.2011.00490.x/full" target="_blank">amphipods</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalia_Belkova/publication/12725338_Diversity_of_bacteria_at_various_depths_in_the_southern_part_of_lake_Baikal_as_detected_by_16S_rRNA_sequencing/links/00b49528d5fcc08ddc000000.pdf" target="_blank">bacteria</a>, and fishes like <em>Trematocara</em> and Abyssocottids, but not very many for several reasons.</p>
<p>The biggest reason is that the abyssal zone of the ocean is truly enormous and has existed for billions of years. Evolution has been able to have its heyday down there, which has led to a diverse assemblage of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, and other invertebrates.</p>
<p>On top of this, there are only two freshwater lakes on earth that are over 1000 m deep, Baikal and Tanganyika. The latter is about ten million years old, the former perhaps 30 million years old. Compared to the age of the ocean, that is a tiny fraction of time. They have also been isolated from other water bodies due to topography, so there aren't many immigrants that can later evolve into new species.</p>
<p>In addition, Tanganyika has spent a significant proportion of its history as a much shallower lake than this (it was actually multiple lakes, which is <a href="http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/7087/Mitochondrial_Phylogeography_of_Rock_Dwelling_1996.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">reflected in the diversity of cichlid fish there</a>). So the abyssal zone in Tanganyika is relatively young and unstable.</p>
<p>Baikal is older and larger and the abyssal zone was more stable (including never scoured by ice like most similar lakes), but it is still in a cold climate (less biodiversity to begin with) and isolated from other bodies of water. Because of the depth of ice coverage, the entire Baikal ecosystem has occasionally <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099" target="_blank">collapsed</a>, effectively re-starting the evolutionary race.</p>
<p>So the two lakes on earth that are deep enough to be completely devoid of light just haven't had the evolutionary chances of the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're basically stuck in their larval cycle and due to living in dark caves they have no eyes. Not 1000 meters deep, but still pretty neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'd never even heard of such a thing until I was wandering around Qu√©bec and found Pink Lake. I found it fairly fascinating.</p>
