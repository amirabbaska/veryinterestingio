		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from those fleeting transuranic elements with tiny half-lives that can only be created in labs, all elements of the periodic table are naturally present on Earth. I know that elements heavier than iron come from novae, but how is it that Earth has the full complement of elements, and is it possible for a planet to have elements missing?</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, such a lot of insightful comments! Thanks for explaining this. Turns out that not all elements up to uranium occur naturally on Earth, but most do.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astrophysicist here - </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>past supernovae and kilonovae produced a lot of these elements. Just this past discovery of the colliding neutron stars that got a lot of news for its gravitational wave, it produced  <del>solar</del> many earth masses of gold. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most important thing though is turbulent mixing in the interstellar medium. This process mixes heavy elements in a very short timescale. So effectively there's pretty much of the same relative abundance of the same periodic table elements everywhere. Astronomers routinely just used a term called metallicity Z to describe the content of heavy element relative to the sun. </p>
</li>
<li>However, have we lived in an elliptical galaxy,  or some region of the halo of a galaxy, there are chances that the relative pattern might be different for alpha elements. This is because of the population of stars that could be different. More type I vs type II supernovae could change this. </li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: See correction down comments below. Not solar masses. But you get the idea </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's at least one element we never really discovered until we observed the decay of uranium</p>
<p>Astatine is a highly unstable element and is thought to only have 30 grams in the entire earths crust. It's never been observed by the naked eye.</p>
<p>With such small amounts available for study it unlikely we have confirmed all of it's chemical properties though we likely have a good model from what they are.</p>

<p>Francium is also ridiculously rare
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francium" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francium</a></p>
<p>I believe that as long as a planet has uranium on it it'll be guaranteed to have all decay elements between it and lead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can find a tiny trace of Iridium in the Earth's crust but it's much more abundant in meteorites. </p>
<p>The sun formed in a stellar nursery that had already been seeded with heavy elements from the remnants of a long dead star that had gone supernova. </p>
<p>That's why you would expect to find pretty much all naturally occurring elements here. </p>
<p>Uranium, platinum and gold might have to be made in neutron star collisions as supernovae alone might not be energetic enough to synthesise those elements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is technetium with the atomic number 43 so not a transuranic. There are no stable isotopes, and whatever there is is manmade. But that's a bit of a technicality, because you are really asking about stable isotopes.
I'd say Helium is a better example - pretty much all of the initial helium got baked out when the Earth was formed, and Helium was first identified not on Earth, but in the absorption spectrum of the sun. The helium we are using now is a product of radioactive decay (Alpha particles are helium nuclei). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
