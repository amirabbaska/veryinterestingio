		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For similar reasons that explain why a pot of water doesn't all turn to steam (well, vapor, then steam) at once. The change is a gradual progression.</p>
<p>So, air holds water. To an extent. Higher pressure air holds more water. Warmer air holds more water. The amount of water in the air is called the absolute humidity, but since different pressures and temperatures of air can hold different amounts of water, we refer to something called the relative humidity. Relative humidity is the amount of water that the air <em>is</em> holding compared to how much the air <em>can</em> hold at that temperature and pressure. This is referred to as a percentage of saturation.</p>
<p>So, let's say you have hot, wet air down by the ground (more pressure), and it's moving up into an area of cold air with less pressure, due both to the rise in elevation and the lower temperature (which decreases pressure). At the beginning, you had a certain amount of water in the air, that was the absolute humidity, but the air was able to hold it. That means that the absolute humidity was at or below 100% of what the air can hold (meaning relative humidity is at or below 100%). As you move the air up to the cold, low-pressure area, the air can hold less and less water. At some point the absolute humidity is going to surpass the air's ability to hold it. At this point water condenses, and drops fall.</p>
<p>Now, as the drops fall, they do gather more water and get bigger, but as they get bigger and faster they start breaking up again. This is why there is a limit to the size of drops that we see.</p>
<p>Now, the main reason that all of the water does not drop at once is because all of that change that I mentioned happens over time, not instantaneously. In order for all of the water to drop at once, you would need to instantly cool or depressurize a local region of atmosphere. Not only that, but all of the water molecules would have to be instantly teleported together into drops, since they were all spread out at first.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. I didn't go back and read what I wrote, so that may be kind of confusing.</p>
<p>Edit: I keep logging on to questions. I'm sorry if I confused you. It was an ELI5, but I had to draw the line and dumb it down somewhere. Some want more explanation, some want less. I tried, that's all I can say. But for those of you that keep telling me that I'm wrong about air pressure, or temperature, and amount of water in the air, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law" target="_blank">The ideal gas law</a>, and if you still disagree, then please go take some meteorology courses that may or may not help you understand the relation between a closed system and multiple open systems.</p>
<p>Edit 2: For all others, if you have a real question that you think I can answer, feel free to PM me. Reddit is a difficult place to explain anything more complicated without writing a book that no one will read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Updrafts cause rain.</p>
<p>Humid air gets raised up and up until it cools off enough to condense. Small rain droplets may not be big enough to overcome the updrafts, so they keep accumulating until they are big enough droplets to fall through the updrafts. The process is gradual so it takes some time to deplete your cloud, and there is never a case of a cloud just dropping all of its water in an instant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't all fall at once, but the reason a storm can continuously drop rain as it rolls across a state is because the inflow of the storm is constantly picking up moist air.</p>
<p>Storms aren't just a cloud of water, they are a complex system of air currents that allows the storm to continually recharge. The storm only dies out when it outpaces this system of air currents (or the air currents dwindle due to day/night cycles).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clouds are like a sponge. Changes in pressures and temperatures start squeezing the cloud. Sponges don't drop all of their water out at once. Even if you squeeze it very quickly, it still takes a certain amount of time for you to gradually squeeze the sponge. </p>
<p>The atmospheric pressures and temperatures are like a slow-squeezing fist. Fast and heavy storms, when rain falls with heavier drops and seems to be faster, the change in atmospheric conditions happened more quickly, like you squeezing the sponge faster. </p>
<p>It's possible I'm missing some technical detail but I think this is an ELI5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
