		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick explanation of drug development is necessary. Translational research takes place at different levels; basic, preclinical, phase I, phase II, phase III, and phase IV. </p>
<p>At the basic level, the properties of compounds are studied. Potentially useful compound proceed to the next level of research depending on the data. </p>
<p>At the preclinical level, potential drugs are tested in cells and small mammals like mice. This is considered pre-clinical research. If results are promising, an expensive clinical can be considered. </p>
<p>Phase I clinical trials test for toxicity in healthy people. They test the range limits to look at side-effects. If positive results, next level trials proceed. </p>
<p>During phase II trials, efficacy is tested in the disease model patient. Patients with the disease are treated with potential drug within levels established in phase I are observed. If positive results occur, a larger scale study begins. </p>
<p>The larger scale study is actually phase III. At this point, the FDA will clear the drug if phase III trials show that new drug treats the disease better than what's currently out. If approved, a drug enters the playing field and is continually observed for what's known as phase IV trials. </p>
<p>Phase IV trials are not the same, but play an important role to observe  very rare side-effects. It is impossible to track 1:1,000,000 effects in trials with only 50K patients. This ensures safety of patients. See the history of zimelidine for an example of a drug that was pulled during phase IV. </p>
<p>The whole process costs 100s of millions of dollars and takes 10-20 years. If the drug fails anywhere along the process, there often no recovery of the investment. This is why new drugs cost a lot. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sensationalized media coverage of early research: most basic science doesn't make it to the end of clinical trials. The number is very slim that anything gets to a phase I trial. If they do, 9/10 of those will fail somewhere along the process. If you get early work in the news, you're not getting an accurate representation of what's actually going to make it. Look at phase II successes to get more accurate results. The drop off in phase III is much lower then anything before it. By then, you've weeded out a lot of unsafe drugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drug development is slow: from beginning to end, a drug will take 10-20 years of development before we can see it in the market. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancer isn't a single disease: cancer is actually a bunch of diseases, depending on where you get it and what subtype. Each is different and can't be treated the same, unless we're talking systemic delivery like dox or other cell poisons. A study for treating pancreatic cancer is only for that type of pancreatic cancer. If it works, it'll work for that type of cancer, not brain cancer or any of its subtypes. </p>
</li>
<li>Cancer evolves: the scariest part of cancer is that even if a drug makes it to the end of phase III trials and it is effective at killing cancer, it isn't all-encompassing. Cancerous cells divide fast and introduce errors at the genetic level and eventually produce resistance to the drug developed to fight it. One-single cell left behind by a therapy (99.99999% effective) can result in recurrence years later, meaner and stronger than before. Why? The drug that didn't kill it is now unable to kill the new cells with an ability to resist it. Combination therapies are the fad in literature because of this. I'm firmly behind it. </li>
</ol>
<p>TLDR; news likes to exaggerate or reports on things early in development. Most therapies don't make it to the end for various reasons. Cancer treatment is specific. One treatment doesn't work on others so what you read is not universal if it gets past phase III. Finally, cancer can evolve to resist new therapies even if they work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main factors here.</p>
<p>One is that medical treatments tend to get most of their news coverage when they're in early development, since that's when they're novel.  It takes years for a new medical treatment to get from &quot;we're pretty confident this will work&quot; to mainstream usage, both because there are a lot of processes to follow to make sure it's actually safe and effective, and because when it's new it's really expensive and so the existing treatments continue to be used in some cases.</p>
<p>The second is that unless you're an oncologist, you probably have no idea what methods are actually being used to treat cancer.  Some of them are things you heard about a decade ago and now are the best choice and are used routinely, but there's no reason for you to know that.  Survival rates for almost all kinds of cancer have gone way up in the last few decades, and while some of that has been due to improved detection, a bunch of it is new treatment methods.  The 10-year prostate cancer survival rate has gone from 25% in 1971 to 84% in 2011, for instance.</p>
<p>The third is that cancer treatment progress is incremental.  It's incredibly rare that a new treatment or prevention method comes out and cuts the mortality rate for a kind of cancer in half or more.  More commonly, a new treatment will come out that cuts the mortality rate by, say, 2 percentage points.  For a common kind of cancer, that can be thousands of people per year that live when they would previously died, but it's not going to make that kind of cancer a non-issue.  Cancer research is largely about stacking up a bunch of advancements like that, though, so that it can incrementally become less and less deadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Randall did a great job of identifying the problem with new drugs - sure, they kill cancer, but they also kill you. There are a million ways to kill cancer that we already have, but killing cancer while leaving the host alive is another problem.</p>
<p>There's also the little problem that various types of cancer are weak to different things. It's like pokemon, in a way : you see a grass type, you use a fire move. You see a lymphoma, you use radiotherapy. There are many, <em>many</em> types of cancer, and they all demand slightly different methods of treatment.</p>
<p>Back to the subject. So we find this new magic drug <em>VAPE420</em> that supposedly kills... idk, renal cell carcinoma cells really well. Eureka! Call the news! VAPE420 hits the headlines. We now have to make VAPE420 into an actual clinical drug. First, we make sure it doesn't kill too many normal cells in a petri dish. We then move on to mice. Does it kill them? No? Good. We then test them on healthy human volunteers. Phase 1. Does it harm them? Hopefully not! Good, they seem to be okay. We now test them on patients. Phase 2. Does it seem to work? Good. We now test it on even more patients. 3. Are there any major side effects etc? No? Great. We finally are able to sell the drug to the public, which starts Phase 4 of drug testing : feedback. This whole process can easily take 10+ years for <em>a single drug</em>. Congrats, you now have a single fire-type drug. We now need to make a water-type, a grass-type, a ground-type, etc etc etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tl;dr</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are many types of cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different drugs are used for different types of cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drugs that kill cancer can also kill you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing takes a long time so they won't kill you.</p>
</li>
<li>Many types x long time = ?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may not be obvious but it is happening. My brother had lung cancer (never smoked a day in his life) 12 years ago. Through debilitating rounds lasting 6 months of then standard chemo and radiation he achieved remission. </p>
<p>The cancer returned last year with a vengeance, it had metasisizdd in half a dozen places through his body and this time they did some crazy shit where there took some of his T cells, reprogrammed them in a lab and then grew some more copies, and injected them back into his body. </p>
<p>He was in remission 1 month later, all traces of cancer gone, with one freaking injection. It was some astounding, straight up Star Trek medical technology. </p>
<p>In full disclosure, the first two days after injection his body had a severe reaction to the reprogrammed cells, and he had nausea and high fever, but that was it. He walked out of the hospital and felt normal for the rest of the month. Sure as hell beat chemo!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oncology BioPharm employee here:</p>
<p>Awesome research is done every single day.  Some at my company, some at the university level, some at government labs.  Finding the 'cure' is relatively easy.  Developing it, is not.</p>
<p>You need to do ph0 or tox trials, this involves animal studies.  Many great drugs die right here due to high toxicity.  Remember cancer cells ARE human cells.  The key is to be able to remove only cancer cells.  Lots go away here.</p>
<p>Then you need to do ph1 trials, this takes data from tox trials and starts dosing people, here you'll find out if the animal models predict toxicity to people.  Lots fail here due to unexpected things.</p>
<p>Then ph2 comes up, now you're looking to see if this treatment actually works.  &quot;works&quot; is the key point.  You can't do a null placebo, so you need to 'work' better than the standard of care. Lots fail here.</p>
<p>Then ph3 which expands on dosing knowledge from ph2.  Lots fail here.</p>
<p>All of this takes years.  Typically from discovery, you need a good 10+ years to do the trials above, plus the insane amount of characterization of the molecule and ALL of the degradation pathways with complete stability profiles for the drug expiry period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
