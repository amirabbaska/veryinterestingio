		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only are there sections of ocean that don't receive much rain, but there are also massive circulations called gyres. Gyres are basically huge portions of ocean that are surrounded on all sides by currents, so you end up with a rotating central section that is fairly stagnant. Water evaporates from gyres, but doesn't recirculate well with the rest of the ocean, which increases salinity and decreases nutritional components in the water.</p>
<p>What results can be described as something similar to a desert on land. A warm, salty, nutrient-poor area, where life is typically more scarce than in the surrounding areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If you look at a map of annual precipitation, a few of the recognisable land deserts look like they stretch well out to sea. Mainly off the western edge of continents, eg. off Western and Southern Africa (Sahara and Namib deserts).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A vast portion of the South Atlantic, from the coast Namibia/Angola nearly to Brazil is as precipitation free as the Sahara.</p>
<p>A comparable wedge shaped arid region juts out into the South Pacific from Peru/Northern Chile.</p>
<p>And a third dry ocean region exists from the coast of Southern California and the Baja California peninsula of Mexico west nearly to Hawaii.</p>
<p>The North polar region, aka the Arctic Ocean, is as arid as Antarctica.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Earth has three major atmospheric circulations (Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar) in both hemispheres with regions of sinking or rising air parcels located at equator, 30 degrees N and S, 60 degrees N and S, and both poles. Between two Hadley cells at the equator, air parcels are rising there to create consistent storms between 10 degrees north and 10 degrees south known as Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. For this reason, we have rain forests at this latitude. </p>
<p>However, between Hadley and Ferrel cells, at roughly 30 degrees latitude in both northern and southern hemispheres, our air parcels are mostly sinking and drying up the atmosphere. For this reason, majority of world's deserts are located close to this latitude (Australian Outback, Sahara, Namib, southwest USA, Middle East, Gobi, etc). Both poles are also deserts since air parcels are sinking over them as they are both at the edge of Polar cells.</p>
<p>This effect is also mostly true over oceans at 30 degrees N and S and at Arctic Ocean.</p>
