		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was just reading a book on Irish history and realised that so much of it could be made up and I've never know. When writing a book based on fact vs. fiction are there any more boundries? Is there anything to stop you from just making it all up? or embellishing at all?</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Since there seems to be a lot of confusion let me further explain. I understand that research in academia needs to be well sourced and backed up. This question is in the context of popular history made for consumers. Something you'd find in your average bookshop that the average joe would read.</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historian here: </p>
<p>There are two types of sources: Primary and Secondary. The main pieces of evidence and (secondary) the people writing about the main pieces of evidence. </p>
<p>Sometimes they do just make it up! A historian's job is not just to know random dates and people but to interpret the evidence, and this includes looking at someone from thousands of years ago and saying &quot;you know what, this guy is lying.&quot; </p>
<p>Granted, you need to have a strong argument based on other pieces of evidence. Plutarch is an example that I often come across. Plutarch can be super helpful, he is a pretty good academic, is well read, and for the most part does a decent job of giving the basic facts.... but he absolutely loves drama. He will add in drama whenever he possibly can. In his work on Alexander he basically says he's not a historian but one showing the virtue of these figures. </p>
<p>So occasionally we'll get a story from Plutarch that appears nowhere else. Plutarch is known for being someone who studied the other historians well, and we only have a handful of these historians' works still in existence, so we have to rely on people like Plutarch to tell us what was in them. So we have to go &quot;hmm, IS THIS PLAUSIBLE?&quot; If so, we need to look at the evidence, compare what we do know, and make an argument. Somethings we can eliminate instantly. For example, Plutarch says Themistocles and Aristides got into a debate after the Battle of Salamis about how to proceed. Plutarch spent a lot of time hyping up the rivalry between Themistocles and Aristides, so this fits right in.... but Herodotus, who was alive during the actual time of this period, makes it very clear that Aristides was not involved in this debate at all and it was the Spartan Eurybiades instead. But Plutarch changed this one small fact for drama. </p>
<p>So when Plutarch then creates more drama between Themistocles and Aristides by saying Themistocles told Aristides he wanted to destroy the allied fleet, but told no one but Artistides, we can say &quot;Wow, that's a huge accusation, but it probably didn't happen..&quot; there's no evidence elsewhere of it, there's no reason that this would support Themistocles' plans, or help Athens in any way (they already had hegemonic control by a lot) and why would he tell his arch nemesis of this evil plan? So in this case it's not just Plutarch changing some basic facts but he's outright lying to progress the story along to explain why Themistocles suddenly fell from grace and was chased out of Athens. </p>
<p>Now if we look at Secondary Sources: Especially modern ones, there are a lot of ones that outright lie... in fact there's a gigantic market for them -- we call them &quot;Popular History&quot; which are history books written for the public instead of academics. Pretty much anytime you see a news story &quot;Was <strong><strong>__</strong></strong> secretly gay?&quot; etc., this is popular history. If you go to your local book store, your history section is 90% popular history -- these books can't be used in proper research articles. One of the ways they get away with it is they don't actually cite any sources. There's no way to follow their evidence and check for yourself -- they do this purposefully. </p>
<p>With actual historians we are required to show our work, to cite our references, and if this was a proper article I would have shown the exact passages in Plutarch and Herodotus that you would find these changes (and if anyone really wants to know I can dig them up in the morning, but honestly right now I can't be fucked.) </p>
<p>But if I did post them and did cite them and they were wrong it opens up the door for someone to go &quot;Uh, DemDerDemDen is wrong, and here's why, based on this evidence...&quot; and I might reply with other evidence defending my position, but this sort of peer review keeps things honest (albeit bloody ;) ) </p>
<p>I hope I'm making sense, let me know if you have any questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You would source documents and records of the time as well as statements from people who were alive at that time. Just because it happened some time in the past doesn't make the writing exempt from needing reliable and accurate sources in order to back up its claims.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one seems to be actually answering the question posed. In reality there's nothing to stop you, in most countries, making it all up and there have been books that have rewritten history. Unless there's a law and some sort of review process, there's generally nothing to stop someone writing something that's false.</p>
<p>There's a large gap between writing that book and people accepting it though. The book probably wouldn't sell well and if it did, it'd attract enough attention for scholars to notice that it'd been invented and discredit that book. They would be citing the lack of sources or pointing out that the sources contradict the claims made in the book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a more serious and reputable reddit. If people (or reputable experts in your case) like and agree with what you write you will gain upvotes. If you gain enough upvotes you will reach a bigger audience (publication, marketing etc.). Basically you have to trust in the opinions of your audience or, through whatever means you deem necessary, force them to believe what you wrote.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you believe any source of information, even one based on objective observations? </p>
<p>Authority is the answer. Every field has tested and trusted leaders. These leaders criticize and accept. They are editors on trusted journals and books.</p>
<p>Authority can even be measured. In academic publishing, the &quot;impact factor&quot; of a journal is a measure of how many times, on average, each article has historically been cited. This tells you how much weight people in the field give the journal. The editors on high impact journals are thus more trusted than the editors on lower ranked journals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
