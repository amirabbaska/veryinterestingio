<p>It's not free in Canada. The government pays for it instead of the people. Conservatives don't want the government to pay for healthcare, they want people to pay for healthcare.</p>
<p>Conservatives want the government to be smaller, which means less people working for the government.</p>
<p>If the government pays for healthcare, they will have to hire lots of people, which makes the government bigger.</p>
<p>And that's why conservatives don't like the way canada does healthcare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One main concern is the fact that the word &quot;free&quot; is being misused here. Someone is getting paid when a person sees a doctor. Someone is paying for it when someone sees a doctor.</p>
<p>In Canada and other places with socialized medical care, the government pays for the Healthcare of its citizens.  Many of these countries also have much higher tax rates than the United States. That is the primary reason that many conservatives don't want socialized Healthcare.  They believe that they are already being taxed too much as it is.</p>
<p>Another major reason is that many conservatives are also Christian and hence pro-life. Imagine if you felt like abortion is an abhorrent act of murder. Now imagine if your government is telling you that you have to help finance this act of murder. Now you start to see some of the vehement opposition to socialized Healthcare.</p>
<p>Finally, I think many social conservatives are tired of seeing people getting food stamps, welfare, government subsidized housing and cell phones when these same individuals don't have a job and often have no intention of getting one. Their rallying cry is signified by a bumper sticker I see quite often: &quot;Keep working! Millions on welfare are depending on you!&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might help to rethink the way you're approaching the question.  You can't 'give people free health care'.  All you can do is pay for people's health care on their behalf.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it introduces inherent inefficiencies.  Any time you have unconcerned third parties paying for something, you end up with other people making decisions in ways you might not want.  Any time you have people spending other people's money, they end up spending it less efficiently.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to grasp this would be to consider insurance.  Now, you get insurance for your car and your home.  But this actually costs you more than it would if you simply dumped enough money in a bank account to buy a new car/home if your current one failed.  Moreover, that insurance means an insurance company that is going to put all sorts of restrictions on how you need to act if your car/home fails.</p>
<p>So 'free health care' is not actually a pure positive.  There are some very real costs associated, both individual and systemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a libertarian in the US, which is economically extremely for right.</p>
<p>The first reason, as others in the thread have pointed out, is that there is no such thing as free healthcare. Either you pay for it, or the government pays for it, which is really you and your fellow citizens indirectly paying for it through taxes. Either way you pay for it. (Though you pay more for less return if you are rich and less for more returns if you are poor)</p>
<p>There is a moral reason, and a pragmatical reason, both of which I will discuss. </p>
<p>First, the pragmatical reason, as it's a bit easier to understand. One thing that I believe in is the inherent inefficiency of the government. Pretty much anything that the government could do, the free market could do cheaper and higher quality, assuming that they freely compete without enormous barriers to entry. The reason I believe that is the entire point behind the free market, that competition increases quality and lowers price, and the government has no competition. The government has very little incentives to improve their service, as compared to 2 companies that compete, because people will be forced by law to by their product regardless of whether it is a good deal or complete shit. And why would they lower thier margin, and become more efficient, since they don't have to worry at all about losing customers. Monopolies are bad, but the only TRUE monopoly is the one that you are legally required to buy from, which is the worse kind as they have next to 0 incentives to improve their product. </p>
<p>So basically the government provided service will pretty much always be worse than the free market provided one. </p>
<p>Next, we have the much more complex moral reason. From my ideology, humans have a few basic rights, including the right to not get physically attacked by someone, the right to own property, and the right to do whatever the hell you want, as long as it doesn't involve breaking someone else's rights. (So obviously no killing or stealing, etc). From this ideology, the purpose of government is to protect its citizens rights. The downside of government is that it is inherently violent. If you don't follow a law, don't pay your taxes, you will get thrown in prison, and killed if you resist. The entire existence of government is based on it threatening to be violent towards its citizens. Now, we can realize that taxes are also violent. Necessary, sure, because a government will always exist, but we should be absolutely minimal the amount of money and how often the government infringes upon the very property rights it exists to protect. I do not believe the end justifies the means, so I believe it is wrong to demand money from someone at the threat of violence, even if it is spent for your benefit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
