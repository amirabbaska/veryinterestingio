		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measurements of G are affected by a large uncertainty ultimately because gravity is very weak.</p>
<p>You would think it would be fairly easy to extract an estimate of G from orbital dynamics. However, all gravitational effects from a body of mass M are proportional to the combination μ = MG, the standard gravitational parameter. The μ of a celestial body is very easy to determine once you can measure orbits around it (or, if you're lucky enough to be standing on it, the surface gravity), and indeed the μ of most solar system objects is known to great precision. </p>
<p>However, to extract an estimate of G from μ you'd have to divide by M... and you don't know M. We do not have very precise independent estimates of the masses of planet and stars. The G extracted from this method has a relatively huge error.</p>
<p>Thus G can only be measured through the gravitational effects of <em>prepared</em> bodies with well known masses, which need to be much smaller than planets. So you are now measuring extremely weak gravitational fields generated by man-made objects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment" target="_blank">Cavendish</a>-like experiments. This gives a more precise estimate of G, but still with an error comparably larger than all of the other fundamental constants simply because of how small the forces to be measured are, and how hard it is to shield from noise.</p>
<p>Going back to the planets, G measured from Cavendish-style setups is the most precise determination, so you actually use <em>that</em> estimate to extract one for the masses of celestial bodies through M = μ/G. That's how you get the known figures for the masses of the Earth, Sun, etc.</p>
<p>For contrast, hbar is known to definitely better precision because it can be determined directly through a variety of not-as-fragile experiments. An example (not necessarily the best) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_balance#Measurements" target="_blank">Watt balance</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring G is hard*. It's extremely weak, it can only be measured if you have first found the mass and distribution of <em>everything</em> you're working with, and even then, you're in danger of thinking you're measuring gravity when you're actually measuring magnetic interactions. Or static electricity. Or floor tilt. Regardless, you can do an experiment where <em>your</em> value of G look like it's accurate to, say, a few parts per million, but for some reason it doesn't match the value of other peoples' measurement of G. Since we don't know who is right, we have a very large uncertainty in our value.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other's have mentioned, gravity is weak, but are glancing over why potential inaccuracy leads to experimental uncertainty in the reported value:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When measuring hbar, you are working with point particles, something with an explicit position with relatively small errors. </p>
</li>
<li>When measuring G, you need a collection of point particles to obtain a detectable signal. Usually you use a sphere, which has symmetry which allows you to say it's an effective point particle with all of it's mass at the middle, but this is an imperfect assumption because your sphere is most likely imperfect. And here is the main point: <strong>Because you cannot prove your spherical mass is perfect EVEN if it is perfect, your uncertainty on its results are going to be bigger.</strong> You could literally measure G to its true value (whatever that may be)  to 100 decimal points, but you would never be able to believe your result well enough to express your value to as many decimal points as we know hbar. </li>

I didn't go too far with math, given the high school I attended, blocked jocks from getting the good classes. When I see these posts. I always go in to see how stupid I am. Partly hoping I might get lucky and maybe understand it. But you guys are so awesome and put out explanations that explain it in such a manner that it doesn't insult anyone along the comprehension scale. Awesome, Thx again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We just recently calculated Planck's constant in class experimentally by observing the minimum voltage needed to power LEDs of different wavelengths. It was a fun experiment and gave a very accurate result. I'm not even aware of what experiment could yield the gravitational constant but I'd bet it has a lot more variables than the experiment for Planck's constant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
