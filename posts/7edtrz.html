		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you and your neighbour both had 10 dollars in savings and  planned on buying a lemonade stand each for $10 and that can make $2 profit every day. You bought it with your savings, while your neighbour used $5 of his own money and borrowed another $5 with 10% interest.</p>
<p>You both make $2 a day but your neighbour has to make 0.5$ interest payments, thus you earn $2 a day and she makes $1.5. However, you are getting a 20% return on your investment of 10 dollars and she is making 30% on his 5 dollars.</p>
<p>Now, your neighbour realizes he still has another $5 in savings after buying his first lemonade stand. He decides to borrow another 5 dollars and use the rest of his cash to buy another lemonade stand. Now he has 2 lemonade stands and makes $4 a day and pays $1 in interest, thus making $3 for his 10 dollar investment.</p>
<p>You both started with 10 dollars in cash and invested it in lemonade stands, however your friend is making 3$ every day and you are making only 2$! Of course, she carries a risk of the lender taking away his lemonade stands if she fails to make interest payments.</p>
<p>NOW, in the real world you would have to pay taxes on your profit. Let's say a 50% corporate tax rate. Your lemonade stand makes 2 dollars so you end up paying 1 dollar in taxes. Your neighbour's two lemonade stands have sales of 4 dollars, but because her taxable income is calculated after interest payments, she is only taxed on 3 dollars thus paying only 1.5 dollars. At the end of the day your lemonade stand is paying 50% corporate tax rate, but your neighbour's two lemonade stands is only paying 37.5%. We call this a <strong>tax shield</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if your friend had a really weird system of borrowing money: For every $5 you give him today, he'll give you back $10 tomorrow (and you know he's good for it, no matter how much money you give him). Obviously you'd want to give him every cent you have, right? It'd literally double your money overnight! Hell, you'd want to go out and take as many loans as possible, just to give the money to him. Even if you had to pay ridiculous interest rates, you'd make a profit!</p>
<p>For a less ridiculous example, imagine your friend has this system: For every $5 you give him today, he'll give you back $10 in a year. A bit less unreasonable, but this would still be a really great profit for you. You wouldn't give him every cent you have, obviously: You want to keep enough money to pay your bills for the year, buy food, save a bit for emergencies, and probably some spending money in case you wanted to buy a new game or go to the movies every now and then. Even so, you'll still probably want to give most of your spare money to him, because you'll profit so much off of it. If they lend it to you at a good interest rate, you might even borrow some money from friends or family <em>just</em> to lend it to your friend for a year, since you'll probably still profit from that. Even if you owed someone some money, it might be worth it to accept the late fees, because you'll have more money in a year from giving it to your friend instead of paying what you already owe.</p>
<p>This is the system that big companies are in: They <em>could</em> pay billions towards their debt now, but that might not be the best way to use their money. If instead they invest it in their own growth, they might multiply it several times over within the next few years, meaning that (even with interest rates and inflation) they'll profit more in the end compared to if they had just paid off all of their debts right away.</p>
<p>EDIT TO ADD: I tried to keep my explanation simple and focused just on one reason for this, but people in the comments have pointed out that it was overly simplified and missed some (more nefarious) elements of why companies might do this. Since I'm not an expert on the following, please take this next paragraph with a grain of salt, and look into it on your own to understand how it works:</p>
<p>Companies might not want to bring money earned overseas back into the US, because that could cost them a lot on taxes. They might want to invest it, or if that's not possible or likely to give them a good return, they might just sit on the money until the government offers another repatriation tax holiday (When the government gives companies a time to bring money back to the US at a <strong><em>heavily</em></strong> reduced tax rate).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're making 10% a year on they money you'd use to pay your 3.75% a year debt, the best financial decision is actually to let the debt fester and keep investing.</p>
<p>People do this too on a smaller scale, putting money into retirement accounts that get higher yields than what they're paying on their mortgage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>International companies issue debt with huge cash balances for a couple main reasons.</p>
<p>1) Overseas money is taxed at a high rate bringing it back. So it is better to park it overseas so Uncle Sam can't tax it. Instead they get historically low interest rate loans and promise to pay over 30 years. This money is then used for domestic needs.</p>
<p>2) If your debt is 4% interest and you can make 10% return on the same cash with investments, you essentially create a 6% net gain by not paying off your debt. (Same concept is applied to mortgage payoff vs long term investing)</p>
<p>Side note: Repatriating money is hella expensive and there is trillions of money overseas. Whether or not you agree, the corporation was taxed at the country rate it was earned in, and companies don't want to be double taxed if they dont have to. So money sits idle in overseas accounts. </p>
<p>Update: $2.6 trillion in cash overseas. If brought to USA, would be repatriated at 35% tax rate. Essentially forcing companies to not bother bringing it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
