		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WiFi waves are just a form of light, just like X-rays, radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and infrared (heat). WiFi falls in the range of large microwave frequencies (2.4 or 5 GHz). </p>
<p>Let's look at X-rays as an example: they can pass through your skin, muscles, and other soft tissue, but get absorbed by bones or dense metal. That's how we can get images of your bones using x-rays, but not the other tissue. WiFi waves (radio frequency light) don't get absorbed very easily. Like X-rays, dense and metallic materials absorb them best. Since walls are not very dense, and typically aren't made completely out of metal, the WiFi energy can simply go through without being disturbed. </p>
<p>Getting out of ELI5 territory, the ability of a matter to absorb a particular wavelength of light is called &quot;attenuation&quot;. Attenuation depends on the density of the material, as well as the electronic structure of the material, and varies with changing light frequencies. It also varies depending on the frequency of the light. For examples of WiFi attenuation from common objects, <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/135033/why-do-2-4ghz-frequencies-offer-greater-range-than-5ghz-routers" target="_blank">this table</a> highlights the differences between 2.4 and 5 GHz signals. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's sort of the same as asking: how does visible light travel through windows? Every single material has certain wavelengths of light they are allowed to absorb. If this were not true then windows would be completely opaque! So in the same idea, certain materials are unable to absorb radio waves, so these waves can travel right through without much problem since the chemical bonds and atoms don't want to absorb it since they can only allow discrete (specific) values of energy to be absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantumphysics teaches us that electromagnetic waves interact with matter. Visible light is an electromagnetic wave. Light interacts with matter in a &quot;certain&quot; way. If there is nothing to interact with is passes through. an examples is glass. You can see through glass. but for example if you have hold a piece of Paper in front of your eyes, you can't see through it. But if somebody is pointing a bright flashlight to your face, you can see the light through the paper. </p>
<p>Your WiFi has a certain Wavelength. For this wave length it can interact with matter a completely different way. So for your WiFi-Waves a wall just appears as &quot;nothing&quot; as glass does for us. It still interacts and blocks some of the waves but your WiFi is bright enough to still be visible through it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the explanations I see are way above what you would explain to a five year old, so I'll take a crack at it.</p>
<p>Stuff, everything from your hand to a chunk of lead is mostly empty space essentially held together by natural forces such as electromagnetism. The particles that make up wifi are very, very tiny and they move in a wave pattern.</p>
<p>Those particles are able to travel in the space between the atoms. Now, some do actually crash into the material itself and those don't get to your device. But, if the wave's frequency is high enough, the material's density is low enough and of the right structure, then it can get through and deliver hours and hours of free porn to your device of choice. That's why wifi sometimes has trouble going through multiple walls, the wave diminishes in intensity each time it goes through an obstacle like a wall because it's losing particles do to them crashing into the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:</p>
<p>Imagine you have a big net and you try to throw basketballs through it.  The basketballs can't fit through the net's mesh but a baseball probably could and a golf ball definitely could.  </p>
<p>This example is easy to understand, it's a one-way interaction of net and ball.  The smaller the ball, the more likely it will pass through it.  </p>
<p>Radio waves, Long Wave, Short Waves, VHF, UHF, Microwaves, WiFi, Infra Red Light, Visible Light, Ultra Violet Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays are ultimately the same phenomenon (electromagnetic waves) but with a different frequency / wavelength and they all travel at the speed of light.  The frequency / wavelength of those waves (size of ball) determines whether or not it can pass through matter (the net) without being absorbed (blocked by the net). </p>
<p>This infographic from the 1940s may be helpful in visualizing the electromagnetic spectrum </p>

<p>Unfortunately, like most things in reality, the ball and net analogy is a poor explanation.  There's many exceptions where materials will let certain wavelengths through with no problem but impede those with both higher and lower wavelengths.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
