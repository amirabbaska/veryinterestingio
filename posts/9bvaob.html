		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blue liquid inside the can is very thick and full of little bubbles (like a chocolate mousse, but much tinier).
The bubbly liquid is packed into the can really tightly, there isn't a lot of space, so the bubbles get squished down smaller to make room. When the liquid comes back out of the can, the bubbles have lots of space again, so they're free to stretch back out to their normal size. The bubbles are colourless, so as they grow, they make the colour of the liquid look fainter and fainter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gel contains a liquid blowing agent which is volatile so when it is heated/agitated in a small amount, it will turn into a gas and so increase the volume of the liquid creating bubbles inside it. Since there is soap in there along with the rest of the chemicals, the bubbles of gas become trapped giving you the lather.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If anyone is really interested, I think SC Johnson's 1967 patent is the first example of a commercial shave gel. This would become the &quot;Edge&quot; product we all know and love.
<a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/be/b4/33/2a517a40581dd8/US3541581.pdf" target="_blank">https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/be/b4/33/2a517a40581dd8/US3541581.pdf</a></p>
<p>Basically their formula produced an extremely stable gel that would break down and expand into a foam after about 60 seconds at room temperature, or when sufficient shear force (in the form of mechanical lathering with your hands) was applied to break down the gel structure. This would allow better surface wetting of your skin and helping produce a cleaner shave than other aerosol shave creams that were available at the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its basically the same thing as creating a foamy lather from soap, except its been scienced up for convenience.  When you lather soap you're working air into mixture, the soap basically just makes it so the interface between the air and the water doesn't take up as much energy so its more stable.  </p>
<p>With the blue gel, it may have some chemicals in it like isopentane which is just an organic chemical that evaporates just above room temperature, so will expand as you heat it up with your hands.  But they will also have glycerin which will hold onto water well and keep it moist and sort of thick, they'll have oils and other chemicals to make the shave smoother and condition your skin along with emulsifiers to allow the water and the oils to mix.  </p>
<p>They science it up so it maintains a certain thickness and small bubble size as you work air in and heat up the volatile chemicals, but its ultimately the same basic mechanism of creating a foam from soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this one! I work in manufacturing. The gels have hydrocarbons mixed in with the soap in a small amount. The can is pressurized so they stay in a liquid form, but when they are out of the can at atmospheric pressure, they vaporize and expand at something a 1:200 volume ratio, causing the soap to foam. The color lightens because the dye used is now spread out over much much more surface area</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
