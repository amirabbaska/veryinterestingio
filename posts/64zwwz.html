		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have arteries which supply the blood and veins which take it away, but in between those two is a massive spiderweb of smaller capillaries which get that good blood to every cell in the body then take it away once the cells get what they need.  </p>
<p>So even though you have had an amputation, there are still thousands of connections between your arteries and veins in what remains of that amputated limb.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It circulates mostly as it always did. I bet you are imagining blood circulation like some sort of highway loop with big arteries directly connected to big veins, and the smaller vessels and capillaries branching off from them. It isn't like that: The blood from the heart is split up again and again until it is all going through tiny capillaries. Then the blood to go back to the heart is collected from the tissue by capillaries which then combine back into larger veins.</p>
<p>So if you cut off a limb it isn't like you removed a section of that central highway backbone and need to reroute before things can flow. Instead think of it like a fluid source being split up to be pushed through a sponge (the tissues) and then collected on the other side by a return fluid system. If you remove a big section of the sponge and plug up the larger supply tubes everything else continues as normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture a ladder standing on end. The ladder is hollow. Now start pumping blood up one leg of the ladder. The blood reaches the first rung, and some of the blood goes through the rung and down the other leg. The rest of the blood continues up the leg of the ladder, until it reaches the second rung, and some of the blood flows through it and down the other leg. This continues all the way up, with blood flowing up the leg of the ladder, across the rungs, and down the other side. Now, cut the top off of the ladder. Blood will continue to flow up the leg, across the remaining rungs, and down the other side. That's how blood flows through a limb after an amputation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A water treatment facility supplies water to the entire city's four regions, the south, north, east, and west. What it does is send water through very large pipes into these different regions, and then smaller pipes and containers capture the water and start dividing it by streets, then smaller pipes send water into homes, and smaller pipes send the water into the faucets, toilets, and showers.</p>
<p>Then, drains take it all back in the same way small pipes in the drain to the bigger pipes under the homes to bigger sewer pipes in the ground that take the water all the way back to the water treatment facility to purify the water.</p>
<p>One day, a tornado rips through and rips up some of the houses, to the root, in the southern region. Water status pouring out very wastefully and if left unchecked*, too much water will be wasted that other regions in the city need. So, what they do is just shut down the main pipe leading into the southern region so water doesn't go into that region, but the other regions are still functioning as normal. Water still flows into those regions, runs through the main pipe then smaller pipes into homes and back into sewers and back to the water treatment facility. It just doesn't have to go into the southern region anymore.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the main misconception is that people believe our blood system was a circle. You know, you pump blood in the arteries and all the blod flows in a giant cucular path all arround your body until it reaches your heart again. If you cut a leg the path is broken and blood cannot flow anymore. If that was the case we had a big problem because that would mean if you cut a vein blood would pour out as if it was an arterie and you would die. </p>
<p>Thankfully this is not the case. We have two seperate blood systems. The arterie which has overpressure and the vein system which has an underpressue. Cutting a vein open some will get out but due to the underpressue most of it will stay inside. If you cut an arterie you will see a fountain of blood and you have to apply pressure on the wound to keep the blood inside.</p>
<p>So how this works is your heart pumps blood from your veins into your arteries system. This constant overpressure in the main arteries presses the blood through tiny paths in between all cells of your body. The underpressure in the veins sucks alll this blood into its system again. </p>
<p>So instead of a giant circle you have many arteries and veins which are all dead ends creating over and underpressures. Attached to those dead ends are many many tiny tunnels acting like a web all across your body were the blood gets pressed into and sucked out again. The mechanism is much more simple than it sounds and you could easily rebuild it using a regular pump.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Due to this overpressue effect your face for example slighly increases in size each time the heart pumps. It's hard to see with the human eye but a camera and a neat algorithm can see it. This is how good authentification software verifies a person is actually a living being and not a photograph for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
