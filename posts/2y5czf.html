<p>EDIT: Here's the post I am referring to, the link has since gone dead: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_%C2%B5torrent_has_included/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_%C2%B5torrent_has_included/</a></p>
<p>EDIT2: Wow, this got big. I would consider /u/wessex464's answer to be the best ELI5 answer but there are a tonne more technical and analogical explanations that are excellent as well (for example: /u/Dont_Think_So's comments). So thanks for the responses.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are digital currencies used online.  It's money you can spend online, and you can convert it to actual money if you want.  In the real world, the supply of money is typically controlled by a government or corporate boards.  Cryptocurrency 'coins' are produced by the entire system (the network of participants) so it is decentralized; no one person can control it.  There is a public ledger that records all transactions and this is called a block chain.  </p>
<p>People, called &quot;miners&quot;, add to this ledger over time, recording all the transactions that go on in the network (every time someone spends a coin it gets recorded who spent it and who received it).  To ensure the system is secure and no one person can manipulate the ledger, the system requires 'proof-of-work'.  The proof of work comes in the form of a computer doing calculations, and uses an encryption scheme, which other computers in the network verify.   Basically, in order for your computer to add transactions to the block chain, it must prove to the network that it's honest.  The miner that uses his computer to help add transactions to the block chain, can get rewarded with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>I told you all that, because you need to know that before I can answer your question as to what an 'automatic crytocoin miner' is.  It is a program that runs in the background on your computer and does the 'work' described above.  But instead of you earning the money from the work your computer is doing, someone else is, because they are sending the results of that work to another computer on the internet and then to the cryptocurrency network.  </p>
<p>The implications are that it will negatively impact your computers performance while uTorrent is running, and raise your electric bill, because your computer will require more power to do the calculations in the background while you do whatever you typically do on your computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Posted 05 March 2015 - 11:45 PM</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We design our software to ensure that partner software downloads don't occur without approval by the user. But given your report, weâ€™ve also double-checked this particular offer, and have determined that it cannot be installed without user approval.</p>
<p>Epic Scale is a cryptocurrency miner that uses a portion of your CPU cycles to contribute to the mining effort. A portion of the proceeds from this effort go to philanthropic initiatives. Please visit <a href="http://www.epicscale.com/" target="_blank">http://www.epicscale.com/</a> for more information. Epic Scale is a great partner for us to continue to generate revenue for the company, while contributing funds to good causes. In the future, Epic Scale plans to contribute CPU cycles to other initiatives, such as Genome mapping and other academic studies that require a great deal of processing power.</p>
<p>As Groundrunner stated, it's easy to uninstall the software via Add/Remove Programs. Per the Epic Scale CEO's response in comments on the link you shared, the only data left in ProgramData\Epicscale is a simple UUID (Unique User ID). This remains so that in case the software is reinstalled, BitTorrent would still be associated with the user. Feel free to delete this folder. You certainly won't see any persistent auto-reinstalls of the software, it will be gone from your machine for good.</p>
