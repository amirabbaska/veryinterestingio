<p>Ok, first some pedantry, melted rock at the surface of the Earth is called lava, not magma (magma is the same material when still beneath the surface). Two things to consider, lava is quite dense and viscous (i.e. it's thick). Both of these actually vary as a function of composition, but if you have an exposed pool of lava (these really aren't that common) it's likely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_lake" target="_blank">lava lake</a>, which is usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt" target="_blank">basaltic</a> lava. The density of basaltic lava is in the neighborhood of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma#Density" target="_blank">2700 kg/m^3</a> and viscosity is around <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/ess439/ESS%20439%20Lecture%203%20slides.pdf" target="_blank">10^1 -  5x10^2 Pas</a> (depending on temperature). For reference the density of water is ~1000 kg/m^3 and viscosity is in the neighborhood of 1x10^-3 Pas (again depending on temperature), the viscosity of basaltic magma is more akin to <a href="http://www.vp-scientific.com/Viscosity_Tables.htm" target="_blank">somewhere between honey and peanut butter (1 CP = 1 x 10^-3 Pas)</a>. The average density of a person is also around 1000 kg/m^3 give or take. So, you would be jumping onto a very dense (compared to you or liquids we're use to jumping into) and very thick material, so you would definitely splat. </p>
<p>The complication to your splat is that basaltic magma is REAL hot, around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma#Composition,_melt_structure_and_properties" target="_blank">1300 degrees Celsius</a>, so you would catch on fire pretty much immediately, likely even before you hit the lava surface because the air immediately above the lava is also going to be very hot. A good analogue of what would happen can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=kq7DDk8eLs8" target="_blank">in this video</a> in which some volcanologists through a bag of wet, organic trash into a lava lake. The response of the lava (i.e. the fountaining) is because of the addition of water (which would also happen if a person jumped in, as we are pretty water rich).</p>
<p>EDIT: To add, while stable pools of other kinds of liquid lava generally don't exist on Earth, even if they did, the answer would be the same. The density of more silica rich lavas (like andesitic or rhyolitic) is slightly less than that of basalt and their temperatures are not as hot, but still much denser than a human and still really hot, and as a bonus these silica rich lavas are actually much more viscous so you would be met with an even thicker material.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Myself and others have responded to some of the (very frequently) repeated questions, but here are answers to a few.</p>
<p><strong>Lava vs magma distinction:</strong>  Location is the primary difference, but the difference in location leads to different properties that make the distinction useful. One of the biggest is the absence vs presence of dissolved gases. Magma, as it is still underground and under pressure, can have a decent amount of gases (water, carbon dioxide, various nitrogen and sulfur compounds, etc) dissolved in it. For basaltic magma, the concentration is low, around 1-2%, for more silica rich magmas like rhyolitic magma, it may have upwards of 8% dissolved gases. The presence of these gases changes the composition of the material and also the types of minerals that can/would form if you crystallized the melt. Once it reaches the surface and the pressure is released, these gases come out of solution, and you would now call it lava. An imperfect analogy (especially the temperature aspect) would be the important distinction between if someone asked you if you'd like a soda, you would probably assume that they were giving you a cold, bubbly beverage (magma), but if instead they handed you a warm, flat soda that had been sitting on the counter open for a few hours (lava), you would question as to why they had not specified that it was a warm, flat soda, but in the process perhaps better understand the magma-lava distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Viscosity of lava:</strong> We have both calculated and measured the viscosity of lava directly. <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1801/downloads/pp1801_Chap9_Cashman.pdf" target="_blank">This PDF (jump to the eight page, to the Rheology section)</a> from the USGS describes this a bit for Hawaiian basaltic lava. In a similar vein, for the few asking, yes, lava is a non-newtonian fluid, this is also talked about a bit in the pdf.</p>
<p><strong>Location at which you catch on fire:</strong> All of the people convinced that you would catch on fire before impacting the lava and all of the people convinced that you would only catch on fire after impacting the lava should 1) stop messaging me and 2) start messaging each other. In all seriousness, the heat of the air around lava is going to depend a lot on the details. This <a href="http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/how-close-can-i-get-lava-and-will-it-hurt-or-kill-me" target="_blank">page from the volcano group at Oregon State</a> does a good job of describing the factors that make approaching lava safe vs unsafe. Basically, if there is an intact crust on top of the lava, you would probably not catch on fire until you broke through that crust, but this is not a definitive answer.</p>
<p><strong>What about this depiction of lava in this movie:</strong> They're mostly all wrong. Gollum would not sink. The dude from Volcano in the subway would not melt. You could not drive a car across an active lava flow. You (or not even Chris Pratt) could not outrun a pyroclastic flow (or survive being engulfed in one). Etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it depends on if it's bubbling lava or if it's crusted over. Another part is how high you would be falling from.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/kq7DDk8eLs8" target="_blank">Here's a good video showing organic matter being thrown into a volcano</a>. (read video comments for more info) </p>
<p>If that were a human who dove/feet first into the lava, you'd likely splash through. And then your body would immediately explode due to all the water in your body turning into steam at once.</p>
<p>If you belly flopped, you'd likely splat due to the surface tension, and depending on the temperature, you'd likely just burn.</p>
<p>Now if this volcano were roaring with fresh red lava bubbling up, the temps would be immense, and any surface tension would be gone. You'd possibly catch on fire on the way down and explode on contact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
