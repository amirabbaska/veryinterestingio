		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. The perception is that tenure among jobs is much lower these days tends to come because people are comparing different age groups.</p>
<p>If you compare the same age group (say 25-34) from the 50's to now, it's basically flat. Basically, younger workers switch jobs more often than older workers, which is easy to misinterpret.</p>
<p>*
One big disclaimer, however, is that the BLS (the agency that collects this data), did change how they asked the question in 1983, and again in 1996.So you do need to be a bit careful about comparing them directly. However it's basically the only source that goes back that far.</p>
<p>There may be other issues as well. For example, women entering the workforce, and people being much less likely to move around than in the past, likely influence things.</p>
<p>sources:</p>

<p>As the 538 article mentions, there have been a lot of publications that make the mistake of comparing different age groups, which tends to create the impression. It's also common wisdom that less pensions give more incentive for workers to switch jobs (and it's known that switching jobs more often correlates to higher salary)</p>
<p>Also, LinkedIn did a survey and found that millenials are changing jobs more often than older workers did when younger, but I would consider the older survey data far more trustworthy than the recollection of people interviewed by LinkedIn so much later.</p>
<p><strong>tldr: It doesn't look like it, although there aren't buckets of old data.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I started at my current employer of 12 years everybody who arrived there basically never left due to the good conditions and pension. Not long after they changed the policy for new hires and since then people come in and get trained then start looking for something else pretty quick. There is nothing keeping them at the job and the career path forward is clogged with people clinging on to their pension but not really pushing to advance their career. I ended up having to transfer abroad to move up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it was a majority, but it was far, far more common than it is now.</p>
<p>It wasn't just limited to white collar workers.</p>
<p>My dad recently retired after over 50 years doing waterproofing and restoration work. He started working there at 16, and was employed by them for all except 1 weekend. (He got pissed at his boss's son, quit, and the company almost lost a lot of restoration work on historic buildings, because they wanted my dad's work specifically, not just that company... Boss brought him back on Monday, with a raise, and a promise not to let the son be a micromanager.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been with the same company for 28 years since I left college. I have considered leaving a few times when I felt bored or stagnant but new opportunities within the company always seemed to open up giving me a new career. </p>
<p>These career changes that would be next to impossible applying a new company because I had no experience in that career.  But certain people in the company understood my strengths and could see how they could apply to vastly different roles. They knew me well enough that they were really to take a risk. </p>
<p>Could have I earned more bouncing company to company? Most likely. But money isn't the sole factor in enjoying your job. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My perception may be (ok probably is) skewed due my personal anecdotal observations. I dunno if it's fair to say &quot;the majority&quot; stayed at their &quot;first employer&quot; but there was definitely by my observation a time when many workers tended to settle down with one employer and expect to work there for life.</p>
<p>My father, as one example, was a WWII vet, who retired from the Navy after 20 years in 1962. He then had 3-4 different jobs in as many years before landing solid work in a steel mill. He expected to work there for the rest of his life. In reality, not quite -- around 1981 the mill shut down, which was the only thing that forced him to move to another employer.</p>
<p>My best friend's father as a kid worked at a local stone quarry. I can remember how proud he was ~ 1985 when he showed us his 25 year gift from his employer -- a gold Rolex President watch. He was not a white collar worker, he was a stone cutter. And they gave him a solid gold Rolex after 25 years.</p>
<p>As another example, an uncle of mine worked for Boeing -- I guess you'd say he was white collar, he was an engineer there. Like my father, he had served in WWII and Korea, but left the military in the 50s to get a college education (thank you GI Bill!) and find work in the private sector. He also had a few jobs before settling in at Boeing, but once there, he was basically a &quot;lifer.&quot; So much so that both of his sons went to work for Boeing and both also expected to be lifers there. Although they were not -- both of them had less than 10 years at Boeing before they were (separately) laid off in the 90s.</p>
<p>It seems to me that today neither employees nor employers see one another as long-term commitments.</p>
