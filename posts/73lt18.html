<p><strong>Microstates</strong></p>
<p>How can you ever arrive at a finite number of &quot;microscopic arrangements of particles&quot; when counting W in Boltzmann's entropy equation?<br />
S = k_B log W<br />
It seems to me that there are infinite ways to arrange 1000 particles in a box while keeping the same volume, pressure, etc.</p>
<p>(I understand that introducing quantum mechanics changes this question a bit, but I'm also interested in the classical answer, since Boltzmann and his contemporaries only knew classical physics...)</p>
<p><strong>Pauli Exclusion Principle</strong></p>
<p>The same question goes to filling up phase space with electrons according to Pauli's exclusion principle. You can't have two electrons in the same quantum state, so if you stick to one position you have to stack them in a tower of increasing momentum. But what does &quot;one position&quot; even mean? If you move 10^(-700)m to the left, does that count as a new position where you can start a new tower of momenta? Surely not.</p>
<p>How much space does one &quot;quantum state slot&quot; take up?<br />
If they take up space, does this mean electrons are fat?</p></div></div>

<p>The &quot;number of states&quot; is an integral over phase space. There <em>is</em> a continuum of possible configurations for a classical gas.</p>

<p>It seems like there are two separate questions here. One of them is just asking how you count states in quantum statistical mechanics. For quantum systems with discrete spectra, the &quot;integral over phase space&quot; just becomes a sum over discrete states. I don't see how Pauli exclusion relates to this question.</p>
<p>The second question is how does Pauli exclusion work for identical particles in &quot;similar&quot; states? If you have a free electron in space, its quantum state can be written as a spatial wavefunction and a spinor. If you now consider two electrons, and ignore their spins (or prepare them so that they have the same spin state), antisymmetrization forces the spatial part of their combined state to be antisymmetric.</p>
<p>In other words, the spatial wavefunction must take the form</p>
<p>Ψ(<strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>,</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>) = [φ<em><em>1</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>1</em></em>)φ<em><em>2</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>) - φ<em><em>1</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>)φ<em><em>2</em></em>(</strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>)]/sqrt(2).</p>
<p>It's clear than that this is identically zero if <strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em> = </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>. If they are not exactly equal, then the terms don't exactly cancel, at least not everywhere in space.</p>
<p>When you calculate any kind of matrix element of a two-body operator in this state, you'll end up with integrals over all space of some function multiplied by products of these wavefunctions. If <strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em> is close to </strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>, the two individual electron wavefunction overlap strongly, and there will be strong exchange effects. If </strong>r<strong><em><em>1</em></em> is far from </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>, the cross-terms in the integral will be very small, and exchange effects will be negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is actually only a finite number of ways for a fixed volume.  Look at it this way.   Let's say you take a box and randomly insert a particle into it such that no position in the box is favored.  What's the probability of any one position being selected?   Well it's simply 1 divided by the volume.   1/V</p>
<p>Now put two particles in the box.  What's the probability of selecting two positions?  It is again 1/V for both particles which gives a (1/V)^2  since the selection of the two positions are independent.</p>
<p>But for the two particle case we now have to worry about if the particles are degenerate.  IE if the two particles are indistinguishable. If they are then you have to multiply by 2 since there are two possible ways to arrive at the same configuration.  Likewise when we go up to three we get (1/V)^3 and 3! since you now have 3 positions and 6 possible ways to distribute the particles to those positions. </p>
<p>You basically end up with the total number of states being equal to N!/V^N</p>
<p>When you are dealing with probability on a continuous space (which statistical mechanics is very much a probabilistic theory), you need to stop thinking in discrete terms.  You can have an infinite phase space while still only having a finite volume.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Basically you're heading towards a rediscovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_paradox" target="_blank">Gibbs' paradox</a> here. There is no correct classical answer, and there is <em>not</em> in fact an infinite number of ways (that <em>count</em>, literally), and the entropy of a gas is not infinite. Indeed quantum mechanics comes into this, it lead to one of the earliest quantum-mechanical theories before QM proper (along with e.g. Planck's blackbody curve and Einsteins' work on the photoelectric effect), namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackur%E2%80%93Tetrode_equation" target="_blank">Sackur-Tetrode</a> equation. Which is the correct (but not classical) entropy of an ideal gas in the classical limit. Basically the key concept here is that because particles are fundamentally indistinguishable, and the quantization of momentum space.</p>
<p>The Pauli principle isn't involved here -there's still a difference between quantum statistics (whether Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac) and classical Boltzmann stats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a quantity &quot;density of states&quot; that describes how many states per unit volume and per unit energy electrons can assume.  The Fermi-Dirac distribution describes the probability of an electron or other particle subject to the Pauli exclusion principle occupying a state based on its energy level as compared to the Fermi level, or chemical potential, which is the energy required to place another electron in the volume (and thus raise the Fermi level).</p>
<p>The way the states are counted is to usually start with a simple shape such as a box, and try to see how many electrons you can fit in the box.  Let's take a &quot;one dimensional box&quot; where the electron can only assume many states in one dimension, but can only  assume one state in the other two dimensions.</p>
<p>If the electron is confined to the box, its wave function is zero at its boundary, as it can not be found in the wall of the box.  Because the electron is a wave, it has a wavelength.  The longest wavelength the electron can have with its wavefunction zero at the boundary is half a wave period along the length of the box.  Any multiple of half wavelengths can be fit into the box.  Each additional half wavelength we add to the wavefunction adds an additional possible state. </p>
<p>The momentum of the electron is inversely proportional to the wavelength as in $p=h/\lambda$.  Nonrelativistic quantum mechanism tells us that $E=p^2 c^2 / 2m$.  Putting these together $E = h^2 c^2 / 2 m  \lambda^2 $.    We can solve for wavelength in terms of $E$, $\lambda = \sqrt{h^2 c^2 / 2 m E}$.  We can then differentiate to find $d\lambda/dE$ which is the change in wavelength of the electrons as they are added to the box as electrons are added at an energy $E$ up to an energy $E+dE$.  This is more easily done in terms of the number of half waves $n = 2 L/\lambda$ so that $n = (L/2)\sqrt{2mE/h^2 c^2 } and therefore $dn/dE=(L/2)\sqrt{2m/h^2 c^2 } 1/2 E^{-1/2} $, so that this is the number of half waves per unit energy.  You can do something similar for 3 dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's against the rules to only link to wikipedia (I didn't see them saying so) but I found it rather helpful, as a current undergrad.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In classical statistical mechanics, the number of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, we have to come up with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In the case of the ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the &quot;same&quot; state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an additive constant. (As we will see, the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.)</p>
