		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, think of it like this: You have a pantry and a refrigerator. The pantry has shelves, representing your muscles, canned food, representing your stored fat, and a refrigerator full of food, as your glucose. </p>
<p>You eat the food in the refrigerator until you can't replenish it fast enough, so you (your body) moves on to the canned foods (your fat) until you can get more food in the refrigerator (glucose). </p>
<p>Now, if you were not able to get more food in the refrigerator after you ate all the canned food, your body will start to use the shelves as energy (let's just pretend you can digest wooden shelves). </p>
<p>When your muscles are being used for energy, it's at that point that your body is dying. </p>
<p>So, that's basically how your body works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the body is in a starved state, such as when you are feeling hungry, the body searches for sources and stores of glucose to chew up for energy. However, after a time, the body uses up all its stores of glucose and enters a state of 'ketosis'. This is when the body enters preservation mode, and starts burning off fat and protein stores for energy instead (glucose is preserved to be used as energy for the brain). At the same time, the enzymes in the stomach and pancreas which trigger the sensation of hunger are turned off to further preserve energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body switches to an energy saving mode instead of high performance and uses whatever the energy is available/ stored, it also stops bothering you with annoying pop-up warnings that you aren't plugged in anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's talk about ketosis and things like that, and those answers aren't <em>wrong</em>, but I think it's worth pointing out that the average American likely gets feelings hungry <em>faaaaaar</em> before anything biological really kicks in. It's important to try and sift out mental feelings of wanting to eat vs. an actual biological hunger and need to eat.</p>
<p>tldr: We get used to eating a lot of food, so we feel hungry far before our bodies actually need to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for asking this! I've always wondered why other people could &quot;feel&quot; hunger. They explained it like a pit in their stomach or acid sloshing around but i only know I'm hungry when the idea of eating food sounds good to me and food tastes better. I was actually planning to talk about this with a doctor because everyone else can feel a physical sensation when they're hungry while i can't. Can anyone shed a light on this? I can go for days without food and it won't hurt or i won't feel anything out of the norm concerning my stomach. If it helps, back in middle school and high school, i would skip eating breakfast and lunch, then go home, eat one huge meal, feel lethargic and go to sleep. Am i just desensitized to the sensation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
