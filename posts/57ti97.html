<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/7205016/Ask-a-scientist-Feet-keep-us-warm" target="_blank">http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/7205016/Ask-a-scientist-Feet-keep-us-warm</a></p>
<p>In a nutshell, feet are really good at regulating our body temperature. They lack muscle (and in many cases fat) so they don't hold in heat well and by dilating or constricting blood vessels(subconsciously) we can regulate our body temperature more easily. same deal for hands.</p>
<p>They say it just makes you feel warmer since your feet's pain receptors aren't screaming at you from cold induced pain.</p>
<p>This is outside their answer but presumably for extended periods of time it would have an effect on your internal thermostat since you have one less non-muscle/fat filled extremity to negatively(edit*) regulate body temperate with.</p>
<p>In unrelated news, covering main arteries, like your neck, with a scarf can also keep you warmer since substantial amounts of blood are being warmed. I felt like mentioning this solely because I enjoy scarves.</p>
<p>EDIT: it has been pointed out to me that your neck isn't being warmed per se, since room temperature pieces of fabric can't exactly transfer heat to objects that are higher than room temperature. Bunch of thermodynamics stuff that I'm not going to go on a tangent to explain, but it basically doesn't let things get colder. Heat goes from warm to cold. Wooh!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your hands and feet are also your body's &quot;temperature sensors&quot;. Your feet are also far away from your core, which is where most of your body's heat comes from. You are also less likely to move your legs and feet compared to your arms and hands, resulting in less bloodflow. And while you don't move your hands they will usually be resting against your body. </p>
<p>This also comes in useful during hot summer nights. If you are one of those people who needs atleast sheet over you to sleep, make sure to poke your feet out at the end to trick your body to feel less warm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body uses your extremities for heat regulation. When you're cold, your body pulls heat from your extremities. This is why your feet and hands feel cold first even if they're insulated. Contrarily, when you're warm, your body uses your feet and hands to emit heat to stay cool. This is why taking your shoes off when you're hot can make a huge difference, and why wearing socks can make you feel overheated even if you're otherwise lightly dressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat moves through the body primarily through bloodflow. The feet are one of the more conductive surfaces in the body due to high blood flow concentration and low insulation, i.e. not much muscle or fat. They are also in contact with the ground, which is usually colder than your feet and therefore draws heat from your feet, which readily give it up due to poor insulation. And solid contact (feet to floor) can conduct much more heat flow than gaseous contact (skin in air). So socks provide the insulation you were lacking, and help hold in the heat your feet would otherwise be losing to the surroundings. This also why gloves and hats are so effective, as both the hands and head are high blood flow areas with poor insulation. Also, all of these areas are more sensitive, so you perceive the cold more acutely there just due to higher sensor density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
