<p>As with anything it needs to be challenged in court to determine it's constitutionality.  That has been done on a few occasions and in all cases the courts have ruled that this isn't preventing exercise of a religion nor is it establishing one.  Essentially the courts have ruled that the recognition of god does not constitute the establishment of a state church.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;God&quot; is not a reference to a specific religion (there are many monotheistic religions), and so does not constitute the establishment of a state church.</p>
<p>Edit: Some people seem to be (mistakenly) synonymizing the words &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;atheist.&quot; <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secular?utm_campaign=sd&amp;utm_medium=serp&amp;utm_source=jsonld" target="_blank">The definition of &quot;secular&quot;</a> is either:</p>
<p>a) of or relating to the worldly or temporal <secular concerns></p>
<p>b) not overtly or specifically religious <secular music></p>
<p>c) not ecclesiastical or clerical <secular courts> <secular landowners></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>d) not bound by monastic vows or rules; specifically :  of, relating to, or forming clergy not belonging to a religious order or congregation <a secular priest target="_blank"></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>e) occurring once in an age or a century</p>
<p>f)  existing or continuing through ages or centuries</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of comments claiming that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; is on our currency as a consequence of a fear of communism and a surge of religiosity in the 1950s. This is just not true. The motto goes back to at least 1861. From <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864 two-cent coin.</p>
<p>...The use of IN GOD WE TRUST has not been uninterrupted. The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938. Since 1938, all United States coins bear the inscription. Later, the motto was found missing from the new design of the double-eagle gold coin and the eagle gold coin shortly after they appeared in 1907. In response to a general demand, Congress ordered it restored, and the Act of May 18, 1908, made it mandatory on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. IN GOD WE TRUST was not mandatory on the one-cent coin and five-cent coin. It could be placed on them by the Secretary or the Mint Director with the Secretary's approval.</p>
<p>The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916. It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins struck since July 1, 1908.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to explain that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; was not added to paper currency in the 1930's due to the expense of changing the printing plates. When the printing technology was updated in the 1950s the motto was added. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, </p>
<p>And this be our motto - &quot;In God is our trust,&quot;  </p>
<p>And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually two parts to this question:</p>
<p>1) Why did we adopt &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as our country motto</p>
<p>2) Why is &quot;In God We Trust&quot; allowed to be our country motto</p>
<p>To answer the first question, &quot;In God we Trust&quot; was adopted as the nation's motto in 1956 as a replacement for the unofficial motto of E pluribus unum.  This was primarily done to distinguish the United States from the Soviet Union, which promoted state atheism.</p>
<p>As far as the second question, the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibits the Congress from making a law &quot;respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&quot;  The motto has been deemed to not violate the first amendment since &quot;... the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency 'In God We Trust' has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion&quot; (quoted from the  Aronow v. United States ruling).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
