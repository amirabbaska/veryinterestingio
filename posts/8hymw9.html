		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important factor to consider here is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level" target="_blank">Trophic Levels</a>. The higher up an organism is in the food chain the less energy is available for it to grow and reproduce. In reality only about 10% of the energy from the organism consumed is actually available to the consumer, so it's very hard for the organsims higher up to reach high populations. Thus for a T-Rex, the mountain lion is a closer analogy than the field mouse. Smaller dinosaurs like a velociraptor would likely have had a higher population density because they require less energy to grow, and so more of them can be supported by the available food sources</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/29/12184" target="_blank">Resources and energetics determined dinosaur maximal size</a>, by Brian K. McNab
(PNAS July 21, 2009. 106 (29) 12184-12188) is a little old by now, but I don't know of an authoritative, recent paper that looks at the question.  </p>
<p>McNab starts with the assumption that dinosaur metabolism was similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanidae" target="_blank">varanid lizards</a> -- significantly higher than most lizards, but much lower than mammals.  He reasons from this that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The presumptively low energy expenditures of dinosaurs potentially permitted Mesozoic communities to support dinosaur biomasses that were up to 5 times those found in mammalian herbivores in Africa today. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He shows a bunch of calculations and compares to things like modern tortoises and elephants, and justifies some of his comparisons by arguing </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The terrestrial vegetation that was available in the Mesozoic included an abundance and diversity of ferns, horsetails, Ginkgo, and conifers (5), which some analysts (34) have argued were of equal nutritional quality to plants presently available, thereby implying that the maximal Kh was similar to that found at present. ...  Consequently, the mass-independent food intake of a 40 to 100-ton dinosaur must have been lower than found in mammals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if dinosaur biomass was five times greater than modern African herbivores, that's pretty large (think of the enormous wildebeest herds, elephants, zebras, and so on); but of course dinosaurs were typically much larger than modern herbivores.  A wildebeest weighs a few hundred pounds, a generic herbivorous dinosaur might have been closer to 10 tons, maybe forty times as much, suggesting there would be 5-10 times more wildebeest than equivalent dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Wildebeest herds of thousands or tens of thousands occur, so herds of dinosaurs of several hundreds seem plausible, which matches with <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/largest-dinosaur-bone-bed/" target="_blank">bone beds</a> that have been found.  </p>
<p>Larger dinosaurs would presumably be more like elephant equivalent, potentially living in moderate-sized herds, while apex predators like T. rex would be less common, but perhaps analogous to lion numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of this also depends on if you agree with various herding behaviours. For example, whether the Albertosaurus bone beds in Alberta (Dry Island) represents true density and animals living together or if this was more of a predator trap as is proposed for the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah, representing the densest Jurassic dinosaur assemblage yet found. </p>
<p>An assumption made for the Albertosaurus assemblage is that these animals died together so they were living together, though there could have been some outside factor (ie a predator trap) luring these large animals together. </p>
<p>One assumption based on the large olfactory of Tyrannosaurus in particular is that this animal was using humongous areas of land. We also have a fairly reasonable idea that some of the herbivores were migrating, as we find Pachyrhinosaurus in both Northern Alberta and New Mexico, though I think the species is different we see this genus ranging quite far. So you are left with two options for consideration here: how far were they migrating or how large was their permanent territory. We see modern herbivores that range insanely long distances, such as caribou, wildebeest and even elephants. We also see Carnivores with insanely large territories, like polar bears ranging 10 thousand square km. So it really depends on if you believe these animals were solitary or not and what method they were using to obtain the absurd amount of food needed to power such massive populations.</p>
<p>All that said, we do have overlapping populations of large carnivores and herbivores. A prime example is Alioramus, with more slender teeth, and Tarbosaurus, with bone crushing teeth. So depending on available resources, you could have concurrent populations of huge dinosaurs living in the same areas based on resource division. </p>
<p>It's a complicated question, one that microsite density work is trying to sort out- though it can be tricky when you have individual hadrosaurs (for example) with 2000 teeth in their mouth at once and no real way to demonstrate similarly sized teeth aren't just coming from one individual.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there would have to be a certain density or else the populations wouldn't be very resistant to change and wouldn't have lasted as long. There were higher levels of oxygen AND CO2 in the Mesazoic era so it's not at all improbable that there was more energy  to sustain a higher biomass than we have now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think dinosaur populations were more dense than people assume. People think of T-Rex as some lone apex predator, but people don't seem to account for the amount required just to sustain the species. From successful mating to actually living long enough to reach sexual maturity (which didn't last for a very long time). Also, there's evidence that T-Rex's cannibalized their young. </p>
<p>Given all that, they had to have been around in fairly large numbers just to last as long as they did. So, if T-Rex's were like the lion population today, imagine the numbers of other dinosaurs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
