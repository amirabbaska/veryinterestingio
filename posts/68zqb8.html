<p>E2: just a note, I did my search beforehand and apparently I didn't do it correctly. Move on.</p>
<p>E3: reposts should be considered on a case by case basis. Or somehow allow archive posts to be marked active again or at least commentable. New information can be discovered by simple conversation in a short time period. You can't expect people to get an answer to things from the past if the previous post either didn't answer the question or is outdated (not saying that's my case but just makes sense for others).</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're not flexing just your legs, you're flexing your quads, glutes, and kegels as well. Tensing these pushes your pelvis forward, which is the best position for insemination.</p>
<p>In females, the height of this flexing straightens the vaginal canal and aligns it with the opening of the cervix. In males, the height of this flexing also creates the greatest pressure of ejaculation which results in deeper insemination, and more ejaculate being released in total. </p>
<p>Prior to climax, you're not just flexing and holding, you're flexing and then relaxing repeatedly. Flexing forces more blood into erogenous zones, giving nerves the oxygen needed to keep sending pleasure signals from activity. Relaxing allows deoxygenated blood to drain from the erogenous zones.</p>
<p>This process of pleasure reward for optimal reproductive actions is a product of evolution.</p>
<p>You flex because it feels good. It feels good because it works (i.e. successfully encourages reproduction).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best ELI5 Answer from the previous thread - </p>
<p>An orgasm is, partly, an uncontrolled muscular spasm. By tensing up your legs, you're tensing up other things, and by other things, I mean your ass, since it's hard not to when you're tensing your thighs.</p>
<p>When you tense up your ass, you also tense up everything in the general pelvic area, including the muscles involved in the orgasm. In this way, you're helping those muscles reach the point of necessary release faster than they would on their own, leading to a quicker pay-off.</p>
<p>It also seems more intense because you're involving more of your muscles in the process, combined with the relaxation of everything once you finish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
