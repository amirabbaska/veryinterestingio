I'm not sure, it's been a while since I studied it. I'll go find a source... BRB.</p>
<p>EDIT: the reflex appears to be triggered by carbon dioxide concentration in your blood. So as long as you were still breathing in and out, it would seem the reflex wouldn't trigger.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body can't detect oxygen levels in your blood. It <em>can</em> detect CO2. So the discomfort you feel from holding your breath is your body telling you that your CO2 levels are rising and that you need to take a breath. This is why swimming pools may have a rule saying &quot;no hyperventilation&quot; which is rapid breathing prior to holding your breath, because what is happening there is you getting rid of as much CO2 in your body as possible to fight off that discomfort for longer - but the danger is that because your body won't be pressuring you as much to take a breath, that you could actually deplete your oxygen and black out (and then drown).</p>
<p>If you are in an enclosed space with a fire or running car or something, Carbon <em>Mon</em>oxide (CO) is the risk here. Because this molecule is similar in shape to O2, it can attach itself to red blood cells just like O2, except it's not Oxygen, so your body can't use it, and it's much harder for your body to get rid of. So even if you are still getting enough O2 with each breath, your body is having a hard time finding red blood cells to attach it to. In this case, unless you are woken up by an alarm or another person, you will sleep through it and die. I believe it will actually lul you to sleep. Smoking will also put a bit of CO in your system. Not enough to kill you right away, but it's one of the reasons you'll feel out of breath after having smoked anything.</p>
<p>CO can also screw with your memory. See:</p>

<p>If the composition of the air you're breathing remains constant (21% oxygen, 78% Nitrogen etc), but density decreases (so an increase in altitude), you will be fine up until a point, and then eventually you become hypoxic. Hypoxia initially will cause you to become really, <em>really</em> stupid. Maybe even giggly, very daft, confused, etc. Your brain simply won't work and you just will not be functioning mentally. Enough time in a hypoxic state and you'll just die.</p>
<p>But you're asking specifically if you fall asleep and wake up... I don't think there is any situation where you will wake up. In the first scenario with holding your breath, yes there is a reflex for taking a breath when CO2 builds up too much, but this won't happen because you won't hold your breath while you're asleep (unless someone tapes your mouth shut, in which case yes you'll definitely wake up). For the Carbon Monoxide situation, you will definitely sleep through it and die. It's why people install CO detectors. For the third situation, if you climbed a mountain high enough that the air was very thin, you wouldn't wake up or be disturbed, because the conditions that you went to sleep in won't change and should be fine (but you will need supplemental oxygen when you're awake to actually do anything). If you had climbed a mountain you would have also allowed your body to get accustomed to the thinner air. That doesn't mean your body will be able to tolerate a no-oxygen environment, just that it should fare better than if you went from 0 to 10k+ feet in a matter of minutes to an hour. The only way you could sleep in good conditions and then transition to very thin air is if you fell asleep on a plane than went well over 10k feet, but even in that situation, you would just go hypoxic (and if severe enough die). I don't think the CO2 reflex would kick in because you would still be breathing and expelling CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what i remember, some of the chemoreceptors in your body monitor the CO2 level in your blood. As the CO2 level gets higher the chemoreceptors trigger and in turn a message is sent to the heart to increase BPM to transfer more oxygen into the blood.</p>
<p>I believe in cyanide poisoning cases the cyanide coats the hemoglobin in the blood, restricting its ability to carry oxygen, chemoreceptors detect excessive CO2 and the heart is put into overdrive to get the oxygen level up, in extreme cases it doesn't succeed in increasing the O2 level and increases in speed up until it fails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
