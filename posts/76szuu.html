		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ESO, the European Southern Observatory is building a new telescope. You might have heard of the neutron star merger that was announced today. ESO used their Very Large Telescope (VLT) for that. It is one of the largest telescopes on Earth.<br />
As the next big telescope they have planned the ELT, the extremely large telescope. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_Large_Telescope" target="_blank">see here</a>. It will have a diameter of 40m (compared to a diameter of 8.2m for the VLT) and cost around 1billion euros. It is planned to be finished by 2024.<br />
Another observatory that is planned is LISA, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna" target="_blank">Laser Interferometry Space Antenna</a>. It is supposed to measure gravitational waves by laser interferometry between several satellites in space. However it will be very expensive and complicated and has not gotten past the first planning/proposal stages. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Michigan there is ongoing construction for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB).  It will provide beams of short-lived isotopes to allow nuclear physicists to explore matter closer to the neutron drip line, among other things.  It's estimated to be done around 2021, at a cost of 760M USD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_II_experiment" target="_blank">Belle II</a> will start soon (probably 2018) and measure B mesons with extreme precision to look for deviations from theoretical predictions.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment" target="_blank">DUNE</a> is in development to study neutrinos, and prototypes of the detectors are built.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Linear_Collider" target="_blank">ILC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Electron_Positron_Collider" target="_blank">CEPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Linear_Collider" target="_blank">CLIC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Circular_Collider" target="_blank">FCC</a> are proposed colliders, currently all without funding for construction. ILC got the most attention so far and could start construction basically as soon as the project gets funded, the others need more R&amp;D.</li>
<li>A few more neutrino detectors are under construction and even more are proposed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Neutrino_detectors" target="_blank">Wikipedia has a list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Astronomy: It is hard to miss news about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope" target="_blank">JWST</a> (2019), but there is so much more.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft\)" target="_blank">Gaia</a> is taking data already, it measures the whole sky with an unprecedented precision. It will measure the position, distances and velocities of about a billion stars and many other objects, either as first measurement ever or with a factor 10 or more higher precision. It will probably find tens of thousands of exoplanets (compare this to 3700 known today), double the number of asteroids known in our solar system, and generally produce a huge dataset of all types of astronomical objects. The distance measurements of stars nearby are used to calibrate the distance measurements for everything more distant, so Gaia will improve all these measurements a lot, that improves our estimates for cosmological parameters as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite" target="_blank">TESS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEOPS" target="_blank">CHEOPS</a> are follow-up missions to Kepler, observing more stars (TESS), brighter stars closer to Sun (CHEOPS), and with a better accuracy. Both are planned to launch 2018. While TESS will find more planets, CHEOPS will start the era of precision measurements of their parameters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(spacecraft\)" target="_blank">PLATO</a>, planned for 2026, will be even more powerful, and observe even more stars with an even better accuracy.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_Large_Telescope" target="_blank">ELT</a> has been mentioned in two different comments already, but it shouldn't be left out here. With a mirror area as large as the 20 existing telescopes combined and with a much better resolution it can do completely new measurements. It will be able to directly see the light from Earth-like exoplanets nearby (it will look something <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/internal_resources/464/" target="_blank">like this</a>, although that particular image is from a different study), which allows spectroscopic measurement to study their atmosphere and sometimes surface composition. With sufficient observation time, it would even be possible to make a very rough map of continents of a potential planet that has these. <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/alienmaps_fig2.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a simulation</a> how Earth (top) would be reconstructed (bottom), the quality depends on the observation time and the parameters of the observed system.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Magellan_Telescope" target="_blank">GMT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Meter_Telescope" target="_blank">TMT</a> are two other big telescopes under construction / currently with construction halted. Significantly smaller than ELT, but still much bigger than existing telescopes. They will lead to additional observation time, and they can cover the region of the northern hemisphere ELT cannot look at (as it is south of the equator).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna" target="_blank">LISA</a>, currently expected for 2034, will measure gravitational waves in space. The focus is on sources with lower frequencies that Earth-bound detectors cannot measure.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAGRA" target="_blank">KAGRA</a> as Earth-based detector will join LIGO and Virgo soon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Initiative_in_Gravitational-wave_Observations" target="_blank">INDIGO</a> will join a bit later.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Telescope" target="_blank">Einstein telescope</a> is a proposed next-generation detector that would find many events per day or even many per hour instead of a few per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>... and many more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty excited for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, although it isn't THAT big of a project, only $30mil. When it comes online in 2019 it'll scan the entire night sky over the course of a few days and most of the data will be available to the public in something like a live(ish) updating google earth. They're hoping to catch a bunch of transient (short lived) events that normal telescopes are too slow to respond to.</p>
