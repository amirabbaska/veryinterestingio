<p>Other than human decency, the main things stopping this are (1) rules explicitly protecting minority rights and (2) the fear that &quot;maybe I'd be next&quot;.</p>
<p>These protections famously broke down in Nazi Germany, an advanced and wealthy and educated modern European society that suddenly decided to murder quite a few of its citizens just for being members of a minority ethnic group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several examples of this happening in democracies. The problem is that if you establish that killing off the minority is acceptable there is nothing stopping you from killing off the next minority, and the next, etc. In a working democracy a lot of people will fight for rights that does not apply to them because it may be their rights that is challenged next.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Knowing a system is democratic doesn't tell you much about its morals. That comes from the voters in the democracy.</p>
<p>And if you think it's horrible that a majority in a democracy can do immoral things, consider that other systems don't even need to get the majority on board for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>My first thought was the Constitution. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your first thought is correct, a constitution will typically establish basic rights that a mere majority can overrule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But leaders elected by the majority can amend the constitution and make new laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It typically takes a lot more than a majority to amend a constitution.  In the US, the primary amendment process requires a 2/3rd majority in both houses, and then 3/4 of the state legislatures.  If the 13 smallest states (less than 10% of the population) opposed an amendment, it wouldn't pass.</p>
<p>But yes, at the end of the day, a democracy would allow a very large majority to murder off a small minority.  This is known as the <em>tyranny of the majority</em>.  This is a key concern in political science, finding a government that minimizes both the tyranny of the majority and the tyranny of the minority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in germany the constitution says that articles 1 and 20:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 1</strong></p>
<p>(1) Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect<br />
it shall be the duty of all state authority.</p>
<p>(2)
The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and
inalienable human rights as the basis of every community,
of peace and of justice in the world.</p>
<p>(3)
The following basic rights <em>[articles 2-19]</em> shall bind the legislature, the
executive and the judiciary as directly applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Article 20</strong></p>
<p>(1)
The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and so-
cial federal state.</p>
<p>(2)
All state authority is derived from the people. It shall be ex-
ercised by the people through elections and other votes and
through specific legislative, executive and judicial bodies.</p>
<p>(3)
The legislature shall be bound by the constitutional order,
the executive and the judiciary by law and justice.</p>
<p>(4)
All Germans shall have the right to resist any person seek-
ing to abolish this constitutional order, if no other remedy
is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are irremovable from the constitution</p>
<p>which i mean isn't a 100% failsafe solution for various reasons, but it's better than nothing</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
