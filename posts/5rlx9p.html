		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get the full year's worth of radiation.</p>
<p>From an outside point of view, we see that time is dilated and the astronaut is moving very slowly inside their spaceship. But we see the spaceship take a full year to reach its destination, and gets hit by all this radiation along the way.</p>
<p>From the astronaut's point of view, there is another effect - length contraction. From their point of view, the reason it only takes an hour to reach the destination is because the distance has shrunk down by a huge amount. So, from the astronaut's point of view, they still have to move through the same amount of &quot;stuff&quot; - interstellar gas, radiation, whatever - it's just that this &quot;stuff&quot; is packed really close together, and the astronaut hits it all really quickly.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all that simple - you have to deal with redshift and all that - but it does often work out that length contraction and time dilation basically cancel out, and that can allow different reference frames to not contradict each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Radiation engineer here.</p>
<p>The entire premise of this is a bit flawed, in multiple ways, because it assumes the constancy of things that are in fact variable.</p>
<p>What radiation is, at its core, is moving particles. In outer space, this is mostly ultra-high-energy protons and gamma-rays.  Now, when you're going at almost light speed, you run into an effect where protons that are hitting you head-on are now hitting you with <em>much much</em> more energy, and those hitting you from behind are now being outrun.  Gamma-rays have a similar issue, but instead of changing speed so they'll be outrun (they travel constantly at c in all reference frames), they'll be blue-shifted and red-shifted.  Red-shifted enough, and those gamma-rays won't have enough energy to do anything to you. Blue-shifted enough, they're not going to give you way more dose than they would if you weren't moving so fast.</p>
<p>So &quot;cosmic radiation&quot; is not constant, and &quot;one hour's worth of cosmic radiation&quot; is not a meaningful unit.</p>
<p>Secondly, you assume that time is something that is absolutely comparable.  That it is either &quot;one year <em>or</em> one hour&quot;, and that it can't be &quot;one year <em>and</em> one hour&quot;.  Just because something is &quot;one year&quot; when looked at one way, in no way shape or form precludes it from being &quot;one hour&quot; when looked at another way.</p>
<p>So to answer your question--You get one hour (spaceship time) of cosmic radiation, but the cosmic radiation you get is not &quot;normal&quot; cosmic radiation, but heavily shifted in various directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone re-phrase or re-explain this question? A ship travels at light speed for a year (so it travels a light year), yet the time inside the ship has only been one hour?</p>
<p>Presuming the astronaut has been inside the ship for the duration of its travel, how does it make sense that his time would have been an hour and not a year? Time taken to travel a light year at c = one year. Where's the hours coming from? I understand time dilation with relation to speed/space, but this questions doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone, I get it now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time passed inside the ship is one hour to the passenger and one year to an observer on Earth (meaning our traveler is moving at well over 99.99% lightspeed). From the traveler's perspective he gets blasted by high-energy cosmic rays for one hour. To the observer, the traveler still get blasted by the same total amount of radiation - but at a lower energy for a full year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
