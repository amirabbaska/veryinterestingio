		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Skin contains the pigment melanin which is activated by exposure to light. The palms of your hands and the soles of your feet have much thicker layers of skin due to their regular contact and friction with other objects (the ground, tools, etc). Melanocytes exist in the dermal layers of your palms and soles, but are buried beneath the more callous layers and are rarely directed at the sun. You could in theory try to tan your hands but the results would be pretty minimal compared to the rest of your body.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You gotten a lot of bad answers, and a lot of bad guesses, including the top voted one.  </p>
<p>The really answer is, some people do have dark palms, that match their overall skin tone, and some people have nearly white palms, regardless of skin tone.</p>
<p>You skin (epidermis) comes in two varieties, simply named thick skin and thin skin.  The thin skin has 4 layers (or strata), and the thick skin has 5.  </p>
<p>Thin skin has specialized cells in the base layer (stratum basale) called melanocytes.  Melanocytes produce a certain amount of melanin, determined by your genetics, but are also UV reactive.  When exposed to UV light they respond by producing more melanin.  There are variations in the structure of melanin, but eumelanin (true melanin) is black.  The melanin secreted by these cells is incorporated into the other layers of skin as they migrate towards the surface, and are eventually soughed off.  This is why you get tan when you go out in the sun, and why it takes months to lose a tan completely.</p>
<p>Thick skin only occurs in the palms of your hands, and soles of your feet.  It has all the same layers as the thin skin, with an additional layer inserted just about the base layer.  This additional layer (the stratum lucidum) is actually quite thin, and nearly transparent.  It does <strong>not</strong> obscure the ability to see the melanin in the base layer.  However, the base layer is also structurally different in the thick skin than in the thin skin.  It has higher density of sensory cells (for touch, temperature, etc), is arranged in ridges that translate upward to fingerprints, and it generally has a lower density of melanocytes.  How dense the melanocytes are in the thick skin is another genetic trait.  Some people have the same density as the rest of their body, some people have little to none.  How many active melanocytes are on the palms of the hands determines the level of pigmentation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody here is wrong. It’s because there is an extra lipid layer called the stratum lucidum in the skin of the soles of your feet and palms. The skin is indeed thicker because of that layer, but it’s the lipids that are creating that light color. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our palms and the soles of our feat have a thick outer layer of dead skin cells, this is an evolutionary advantage because we use these to interact with the environment so much, it's important that they be able to withstand damage. At the same time, the dead cells lack the melanin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
