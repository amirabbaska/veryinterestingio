The idea is that most 70s cars looked boring and similar, but the useful life of most cars is maybe 20 years.  So now as we approach 50 years from 1970, the only cars that remain are ones people took extra effort to maintain... meaning the nicest and coolest ones stay and the rest all get replaced by Toyota Camerys (or whatever car is bought by the &quot;cars are a tool to get me to work&quot; crowd).  People only keep and maintain the cool looking ones, so you look now and see all 70s cars are cool. The truth is all 70s cars which survived are cool, and that's a critical difference.  Ugly ones have long since gone to the junkyard.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two major reasons are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel efficiency got much more important to buyers and the government.</li>
<li>Safety requirements that range from specifications the size and location of lights to have any pedestrians hit by the car go up rather than under the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors reduce the design window of what cars can look like (there are only a few designs that are aerodynamic at highway speed and follow applicable safety requirements).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're experiencing bias based on your frame of reference.</p>
<p>If you go back and look at a 1972 Impala two-door versus a 1971 Fury two-door they're very similar.  Same for the Falcon, Dart, and, Nova.</p>
<p>Most cars of a given era are similar looking.  There certainly are exceptions, the various Chrysler 300s often had some unique styling and no one will argue that the Corvette Stingray looked like anything else, but looking similar to your competitors is something of a survival tactic.  If it's too outrageous people stay away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short Answer:
There's no single reason, safety is a big one but not the only one, another one is how cars are made - underneath the outside &quot;skin&quot; cars are very similar, and the more similar you can make them, the cheaper it is - and all manufacturers are trying to make stuff more cheaply. They also own more brands that used to exist on their own - eg. Volkswagen own Audi now, so rather than make two separate small cars, they make one and make a few small changes, and sell them as two different cars. How the air flows around the car is a big consideration today too, and in the 70's we didn't know enough about how it worked - today we do, and it turns out that certain styling features are very efficient, and they therefore tend to get used by everyone.</p>
<p>Long Answer:
Back in the 70's most cars were bespoke - a large sedan was built off a separate platform to a mid size, and a hatch was built off a separate platform to a light car. basically, they were all made independently from the ground up, sometimes even when they occupied the same market segment.</p>
<p>These days, modern production techniques means that there can be cars of multiple sized built of the same platform - VW Group's MQB platform underpins most of their range, including SUVs, sedans and Hatchbacks, and although they all look different in size, they will share certain key dimensions that give them a certain similarity.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is that there are fewer independent brands in existence these days - many manufacturers have died off over the years. Those that are left are in many cases owned by the same company, whereas in the 70's they were completely separate - Audi, Volkswagen, Skoda and Seat, for instance - and today their cars are effectively the same, with minor cosmetic changes.</p>
<p>Aerodynamics is another big one - manufacturers simply didn't need to pay attention to aero back in the 70's, since we knew very little about how aero worked - these days, it's the difference between a car that beats the competition in highway fuel efficiency, and so is always taken into account. Aero developments also tend to be reflected in many manufacturers at the same time, since everyone wants to be on the cutting edge, and hence adopt the latest developments at the same time - and since aero impacts the outside of the car, it's one of the aspects of car design that is most obvious to us (things like slab sides, high waistlines, flat, vertical rear quarter panels, and flat areas around the wheel arches are all aero considerations).</p>
<p>Lastly, there's much more attention payed these days to a &quot;corporate look&quot; - with manufacturers trying to give their cars identity by making them look instantly recognisable as their car. It's the reason why most manufacturers will have most of their range all share a common grille most of the time, and will  put a lot of time and money into having all cars share a common style (it's also why a lot of luxury manufacturer's first attempts at SUVs look hideous - they've got a corporate look that doesn't suit an SUV, and thus end up changing and adapting their look across their whole range to try and make it more suitable.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hear this all the time, but question whether it's true. Take, for example, 55 thru 58 Fords and Chevys. We can distinguish them because they're American classics, but someone unfamiliar with them would see them as almost identical. The year to year changes are also very similar (this actually holds true from 61 through 65, too. The fins on the 60 and 61 Chevys are distinctive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
