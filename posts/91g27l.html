		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A short while ago I bought my first stainless steel pan and managed to burn it on my first use. I let it sit with water and dish soap, scrubbed it, boiled water and vinegar in it, added vinegar and baking soda, scrubbed it some more.. nothing worked. While the burnt bits were removed, the pan was still stained with some dark spots and it looked bad.</p>
<p>Then I googled some more and read that adding a water and vinegar solution with a piece of aluminum foil would remove stains from the pan. I was a bit skeptical, but I tried it out and lo and behold, it was like a miracle was happening in front of my eyes. Within 30 seconds or so, all the stains were gone and the pan looked like new. That got me thinking.. why did it work? Did the burns actually go away? Were they merely covered by a layer of aluminum? Is it toxic in any way?</p>
<p>Could someone explain what happened?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how I look at it, considering that this reddit tells me to explain it like you're five.</p>
<p>Let's start with your stainless steel pan. Stainless steel is an alloy - basically a mishmash of metals and other substances, the end material having characteristics superior to individual components. This being considered, your stainless steel pan is mostly going to be iron mixed with carbon, but the main star here is iron (Fe).</p>
<p>Simple reaction of fire with steel wool, which is typically stainless steel, produces a rusty material which are basically oxides of iron, or iron combined with oxygen in different proportions. This combination is possible because of the high temperature.</p>
<p>Since you used your pan to cook, this is possibly what you see on the pan, oxides of iron that have stuck to the surface.</p>
<p>Lets move to the aluminum foil and vinegar. Vinegar is considered an acid, albeit very weak in a sense that is not dangerous to handle. The vinegar is a good environment for what is going to happen next.</p>
<p>So now you have everything together, the aluminum and your pan, all in your vinegar solution. The vinegar starts to slightly dissolve the scorch (iron oxides) on the pan and so you have iron ions swimming around. This starts of a reaction known as a reduction-oxidation reaction or simply a redox reaction. The aluminum foil dissolves slightly to give aluminum ions, and the iron ions from before become solid again. In a few words &quot;The aluminum displaces the iron from the vinegar solution&quot; Why does it do this? Because aluminum is more reactive than iron and so wants to be dissolved in that sea of vinegar more than iron. Fortunately, there is a guide for this difference in reactivity known as the activity series for metals, where you will find aluminum above iron in the series (more reactive)</p>
<p>Because of this reaction,  see that the pan looks as new again. The pan is simply cleaned, no new coating is applied. The scorch is only superficial, so only some of the outer portion of the pan is removed. We're talking at the atomic level here. The fundamentals of this lie in the understanding of redox reactions and basic electrochemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Galvanic corrosion. When one metal (stainless) is connected to a less noble metal (aluminum) through an electrolyte (vinegar), the less noble metal gives up electrons and corrodes. <del>You basically plated your pan with aluminum.</del> EDIT: This is incorrect. Didn't have my coffee this morning. You need to apply a current for electroplating to happen, and aluminum is too active to be plated. This is likely just the acidity of the vinegar removing oxides from the stainless.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the spots are oxidized steel then it's possible what's happening is the same as what happens in a thermite reaction just VERY slowed down. Electrons from the aluminum move through the electrolyte (vinegar) and into the oxidized steel (iron) which causes it to return to its original state. This is essentially a battery where the aluminum is the anode and the pan is the cathode. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is known as a single-displacement reaction. Essentially, when you burn your pan, you're forming a layer of various metal oxides on the pan (namely, iron). When you put the vinegar in, it starts dissolving the oxides (vinegar is a dilute form of acetic acid, a weak acid); however, the amount of oxides actually dissolved is relatively miniscule, and the solution is eventually completely saturated with dissolved iron oxide. This means the first reaction is in <strong>equilibrium</strong>. By adding the aluminium foil, however, the aluminium displaces the iron from the iron oxide to form aluminium oxide and iron atoms. This means a decrease in iron oxide in solution; the equilibrium is disturbed. In order to regain equilibrium, more iron oxide is dissolved into the vinegar. This cycle continues until there is virtually no iron oxide left on your pan, and your pan is rust-free! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
