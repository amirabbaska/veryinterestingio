		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grey mould, the soft hairy mould you see growing on fruit you leave out too long, is <em>Botrytis cinerea</em>. It is one of the world's most common agri/horticultural pests, in everything from floristry to tomato farming.</p>
<p>It is also a vital ingredient in a certain type of dessert wine. If grapes on the vine are infected with Botrytis and then kept below a certain temp and relatively dry, the mould infection is called Noble Rot. The grapes do not rot, they become permeable and allow water to evaporate, thus concentrating the sugars.</p>
<p>I find it interesting to note that the same pest that ruins your tomato plants is, in another scenario, a necessary ingredient in high quality wine products.</p>
<p>My comment has nothing to do with cheese.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blue cheese molds are similar to bad mold in their basic physiology, but exhibit 2 convenient characteristics: </p>
<p>1) they thrive in the environment of cheese</p>
<p>2) the waste they produce doesn't make us sick or kill us, and can even impart desirable flavors. </p>
<p>I don't remember if it was intentionally added for the following reason, but it is now known to add to the safety and longevity of the food. A bonus function of having a single strain dominate an environment is you don't have to worry about any riff raff (spoilers and pathogenic strains) moving in and establishing themselves.  It's the concept of eugenics at its best application.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue cheese and white mold cheeses are hardly secrets. While the exact sub strain may be a company's development, there is nothing stopping anyone from taking a swab of it and making a clone cheese from it.</p>
<p>Cheese molds typically used in common cheeses can be bought on the internet fairly easily, or you can just take a chunk of commercially bought cheese and use it as a starter culture if you are making cheese yourself.</p>
<p>Blue cheese usually uses penicilium roqueforti, introduced either before rennet is added to the milk, or after the cheese has been formed, when it is then pierced to create more surface area for the mold to grow on.</p>
<p>White cheeses like brie or camembert use a different kind of mold and bacteria that makes the stuff inside melty but covers the outside with a white powdery coating.</p>
<p>If you rub a piece of blue cheese on a piece of white bread, the mold will spread and it will be just as edible as the cheese is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist with a decent history of food micro here. Cheeses with mould like stilton and other blue cheeses are normally spiked with the fungi by the manufacturer. These strains are generally a guarded secret, claiming it creates their uniquie flavour profile that sets them aside from other brands of the same cheese. </p>
<p>As far as consuming them. These moulds are relatively harmless to humans (with the exception of immunocompromised peiple) and have the added benefit of making the cheeses super stinky and delicious. </p>
<p>It dates back to a time when cheeses were made before pasteurisation. The fungal spores present in the factory/kitchen/cave would 'contaminate' the cheese, and people noticed this was actually a good thing. Some places still produce their cheese in the same place as they would have done 100+ years ago, to preserve that historic strain. </p>
<p>Nowadays though manufacturers have isolated the specific mould that they beleive gives their cheese the unique taste, and culture this separately, adding it to the cheese during production. </p>
<p>The difference between these 'good' moulds and others are that the ones in cheese dont kill us. They dont produce any harmful byproducts that harm us. </p>
<p>On another note, what was the first person who decided to eat mouldy congealed milk thinking? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many food applications the use of fermentation is the most tried and tested method. The colour of a  mold is a great indicator how the process is going. Blue and white are good while yellow or red are really bad. The best pickles often have a thick layer of mold that is skimmed before jarring. In traditional charcuterie practises the salted meat cultivates a bad bacteria to feed the good during the aging process. a good introductory book is Mastering Fermentation <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00BO4GTSI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00BO4GTSI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
