I understand they have the armed forces but surely people in the respective armies must be against the dictator as well or at least have family that is demonstrating. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everything else already mentioned, dictators keep themselves in power by spending enormous resources on propaganda (and censorship) to keep individuals who hate the government from realizing they're not alone.</p>
<p>If you hate the government enough to want to act, but fear that you are alone and therefore essentially powerless, you're probably going to keep your head down and grudgingly obey. If you realize that <em>everyone</em> feels that way, well, if <em>everyone</em> revolts, the dictator is in deep trouble. Therefore, it is in his interests to fill the media with lies 24/7 about how great he his, how popular he is, how good everyone under his rule has it, and so forth. It doesn't even matter if the lies are transparently false--as long as you can't be sure the population as a whole shares your hatred for the regime, the risks of revolting are huge.</p>
<p>But when it becomes evident that hatred and unrest are widespread, you can see a dictatorship fall seemingly overnight. Suddenly everyone realizes the regime is a house of cards and reacts accordingly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Governors and Rulers are kept in power by their key supporters, not necessarily by the populace which they rule. Many countries in which the citizens suffer and the elites flourish are actually quite stable, when compared to democratic societies. </p>
<p>For example, in Saudi Arabia, only the royal family can vote in the next king and the king only really has to maintain the support of his family members (albeit larger than your typical family). The saudi citizens has no real say in who rules next.</p>
<p>Whereas in the U.S., the president requires key support from major political figures, who are they themselves supported by their constituents and contributors, who are also themselves supported by local level constituency / stockholders etc.</p>
<p>TLDR: Dictators tend to need to keep less people happy than elected leaders.</p>
<p>You mentioned the role of the military, which behaves similarly to any political pyramid. At the top you have the generalissimo, who is presumably a key supporter of the dictator, and is being kept happy by the dictator. </p>
<p>He is then appointing and keeping happy the top officers he needs to keep the army under control (typically with help from the regime's coffers). These top officers will dispense and acquire whatever influence they need to keep their subordinates under control, and so on.</p>
<p>The army, with the general in the lead, is not likely to abandon the current regime unless a new regime is likely to improve their welfare. At which point they might throw their weight behind a revolution. Its important to note that populist uprisings are typically seen as the people rising up against the establishment, this is a fallacy. What actually happens in a populist uprising is a new regime moving to push the old regime out, probably having swayed some key supporters their way. It's just a better public image to let the people (aka angry mob) do the work for you. </p>
<p>This is why so many new governments born of populist uprisings ends up being just as bad or if not worse than the previous government. When a new ruler comes in power, new key supporters are installed, much of the old support base is purged, and the day to day lives of the people tends to stay the same. Since the money used to maintain the previous government's support base is now being spent to keep the current government's support base happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
