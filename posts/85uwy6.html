		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the primary rules for science labs and GLP (good laboratory practice) is to NOT destroy data.  </p>
<p>If there's an error, you can't use an eraser, pencils are not allowed, white-out is not allowed; a correction must be made by crossing out the error (with a single line so that what was written is still visible), and then initialing and dating the correction.</p>
<p>Also part of &quot;not destroying data&quot; is that the official lab notebook has pages that are numbered (from factory), and the QA department and other auditors (FDA for example) will definitely question, and possibly invalidate the lab work performed or even close the lab, if there are pages that are missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lab notebook is an important document. It needs to keep the record safe. Hard binding does this better. There are protocols surrounding use as well. One should never remove pages, easy to do in spiral bound. They also need to last a long time. </p>
<p>The lab notebook is not just for jotting things down. It's a record of all the work you do, and can even be used as a legal document. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on the other top answer (about it being good lab practice to log steps and refer to numbered pages) I've always found it interesting that the standardization goes <em>even deeper</em>. Every lab I've seen (admittedly not a huge sample, but about 7 unrelated physics labs across the country) uses National Brand Computation Notebooks. They <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xUT1PI7.jpg" target="_blank">look like this</a>, and they cost about $20 each. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how they got a monopoly, but they are pretty well made and people just won't buy anything else at this point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a bit of a special case, but in geology we basically exclusively use hardback rite-in-the-rain field books. A normal spiral notebook would be in pieces or smudged and unreadable by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Basically it comes down to preserving data, which is both expensive and time consuming to collect. You donâ€™t want to have to rely on a .99c spiral for something so valuable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our lab books get signed and dated on each page. The more sensitive stuff gets a counter signature. The lab books are issued and serial numbers logged by the university.</p>
<p>If you can tear out sheets the whole things loses credibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
