We haven't &quot;lost&quot; anything though. People kept right on building amazing structures right the way through history.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is we sorta didn't. When people say we don't know how they built the pyramids, it's more about us not knowing their exact methods, not about how they were so advanced and we could never do it today. We do have plenty of plausible theories but we can't say we know exactly for all of them. The amazement is about what they managed to achieve with what they had, not about us not being capable of replicating it at all.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind the amount of time and effort that was put into some of these megastructures. They took many decades to build and were huge efforts that often took the resources of powerful kingdoms/states/empires. I'd say it's better to compare the building of the pyramids to something like the Space Race and moon landing rather than to buildings today.</p>
<p>Also note that it's not as if these megastructures somehow prove that ancient peoples had better building technology. They would've found it impossible to build the skyscrapers we can put up in a few short years. The Roman ancient roads were an amazing achievement at the time, but they would not have found it possible to build the US highway system. And just because stone tablets will last hundreds of more years than paper doesn't mean that they are somehow more advanced to develop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often hear amazement specifically for the size of stones used in ancient structures. As far as I know, the ancients haven't been surpassed in that regard. We could surpass them if we wanted to, but we have modern materials that are easier to build with. So, we don't surpass the massive stones, and we remain awed by the real achievements of engineering that used them.
Similarly, entering a structure made all of wood with no nails can impress us for achievements that we do not emulate today. The examples abound of architectural practices that awe is that are out of vogue: gargoyles, stained glass, spires, even large scale brickwork is not seen so much and impresses me when I see the beautiful rows of bricks, and the devil's bridges, and the mud skyscrapers of Yemen, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We didn't lose the way these were created.</p>

<p>We can and do make much more amazing things today. The typical office building is a more complex feat than a pyramid and something completely impossible for an ancient civilization to achieve.</p>
