		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) is excellent at breaking up organic deposits such as grease, oils, mildew, mould, soap scum, etc... It's a staple in glass, mirror, and window cleaners.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a powerful disinfectant and organic solvent. Although it can be used as a household cleaning solution, it's not commonly used as such. Rubbing alcohol can be used to disinfect and clean things like needles, knives, jewelry, electronic contacts, etc.. It's more aggressive at breaking up deposits than aqueous ammonia but it's also harsher and more expensive. Rubbing alcohol is also flammable and evaporates quickly. As such, it's not a very ideal surface cleaner. However, it can be used to clean areas which cannot normally be washed or rinsed, such as cleaning spilled soda out from between the keys on a keyboard, where leaving little to no residue is desirable.</p>
<p>Rubbing alcohol is outstanding at cleaning finished metal such as stainless steel and chrome because it easily removes fingerprints and oily deposits. It's also great at removing marker and crayon from painted walls and restoring whiteboards.</p>
<p>Chlorine bleach is an extremely powerful and extremely cheap disinfectant. It's not a cleaner; it's used to kill virtually everything microbial in nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a disinfectant and should only be applied after the surfaces have already been cleaned.</p>
<p>Eg: to clean a bathroom floor, first you go over and putty knife any large sticky objects, then sweep it, then mop with soap and hot water.  Then mop it with bleach and water and leave the floor to air dry for about 15 mins.</p>
<p>Alcohol, due do it's lack of surface tension, is great for creeping into narrow gaps and edges because it just creeps its way into tight spaces.  I keep it in a spray bottle to disinfect food stuff, like wine and beer making supplies.</p>
<p>Ammonia is great on glass, but I mostly use white vinegar, either picking (7%) or cleaning (10%) over the standard 5% for food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Bleach: for surfaces you want to also whiten while you clean. Do not use on colored surfaces! </p>
<p>Alcohol: for surfaces or items you want to completely sterilize and smell awful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
