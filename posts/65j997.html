		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass does absorb light, but not in the visible spectrum. Molecules have molecular energy levels for their electrons (and atoms also have atomic energy levels the same way). When they absorb light, the energy of the light matches the energy difference between the energy levels, and an electron is promoted to a higher energy level. It just so happens that typically, the molecules in glass (mostly SiO2) don't have a difference in energy levels corresponding to the energy of visible light. They do happen to have a difference in energy level that corresponds to light in the UV spectrum, hence UV light does not pass through normal glass very easily (unless it's pure SiO2). This also means you're unlikely to get a sunburn in your car with the windows up.</p>
<p>It also happens that the glass molecules are generally not the right size or shape to scatter visible light either very much. However there is some light reflected from the surface because glass has a different refractive index than air (ie. light travels slower through glass). At any boundary where there is a refractive index change, some light will usually reflect (see the Fresnel Equations). Hence if the surface of the glass is not smooth, it will reflect light in many directions, and it will effectively scatter light at the surface. </p>
<p>EDIT: like Mariofosheezy pointed out, also remember that most matter is not very dense, most of the volume is made up the &quot;electron clouds&quot; hence if the molecular orbitals of the glass don't interact much with the light, then it is basically passing though 99.9% empty space as far as it's concerned. </p>
<p>EDIT2: It get's more complicated than this. Many other materials have other properties that make it so that visible light can't really pass through. Some have very good absorbance in the visible spectrum, others have very densely packed molecules/atoms that attenuate light very rapidly, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A photon needs to be able to excite a molecule in order for it to be absorbed so it would need to have an energy near the band gap of its electron's next highest level or able to rotationally excite the molecule. </p>
<p>Density matters some but only as it places more matter for light to travel through and the same effect could be achieved with a thicker window of less dense material. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the answer is one of your suggestions. The light
interacts less with the molecules. Detail below:</p>
<p>First, we need to understand that light is weird. It's neither strictly a wave, nor a particle. Under certain metrics it behaves like one or the other. This is called the &quot;wave-particle duality&quot;. When referring to light when it behaves like a particle we call it a photon.</p>
<p>Next, light of different colours has different wavelengths. Each individual photon has a specific wavelength, and light is essentially made up of a constant stream of photons. Smaller wavelengths are more energetic (this may seem counterintuitive when first introduced to the concept but you can think of a smaller wavelengths as vibrating faster). Blue has a smaller wavelength than red, thereby giving it more energy per photon. Similarly, ultraviolet has more energy then blue. The spectrum of light ranges from radio waves (1km+) to gamma rays (1nm-). The smallest wavelengths are incredibly energetic, enough to break apart chemical bonds and can even cause damage to a person's DNA. Visible light is approximately in the 500-1000nm range.</p>
<p>When an opaque object is struck by these photons, the energy is absorbed. For each photon absorbed, a corresponding electron is bumped up to a higher energy state. The &quot;space&quot; where that electron used to &quot;fill&quot; is called a hole. These holes generally want to be filled again with electrons. After a very brief delay (incredibly brief for almost all materials), the electrons that are energized &quot;fall&quot; back into the hole. When this happens, they are no longer in a high energy state and need to expel the excess energy that they absorbed earlier. Depending on from what energy level they fell from, different amounts of energy needs to be expelled. This energy is released as new photon. However, the electrons don't fall back down in one step. There are only certain ranges of energy levels that electrons are allowed to be in (depending on atomic/crystal structures). This is different for every material. The electrons falls back down in a few steps and emits a photon for each jump down. For many objects, the energy between these gaps results in photons that have an energy level that puts them in the visible spectrum. Some have multiple jumps in the visible spectrum, and to the human eye they'll appear white or brown or some other &quot;non-rainbow&quot; colour.</p>
<p>Now let's look at transparent objects. In glass (SiO), the bands of allowable energies that the electrons can have is quite limited. When a photon strikes the glass, it wants to give it's energy to an electron so it can jump up in energy levels. However, since the gap between allowable electron energies is so large, there would be nowhere for such an energized electron to go. Thus, the photon does not get absorbed and remains the same colour as it entered the glass and passes through unchanged in wavelength. (A percentage of photons may change direction due to reflection/refraction, but the colour remains the same) Photons that have a higher energy level may be able to overcome this bandgap. They will be absorbed and re-emit new photons just like if the glass were opaque. However, this isn't within the visible spectrum and can't be seen.</p>
<p>Sidenote: The energy absorbed when the photon strikes an object doesn't have to ALL be re-released as new photons. It can also create &quot;phonons&quot; which are essentially molecular vibrations that increase the thermal energy (heat) of the object. That's why objects that don't re-emit the light (appears black to the human eye) get hotter when exposed to light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He is a photon trying to get through his office, there are lots of ball pit balls on the floor (atoms). He wants to move them onto the shelf. If he manages to move the balls he uses his energy to move them off the floor and doesn't get through the room. If the shelf is too high to reach (the energy gap is too great) he doesn't move any balls and continues through the room and gets out the other side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's best to think of light in terms of waves for this. If ray of light hits a molecule, it will absorb part of it and emit another ray of light in the same direction as it usually can't absorb it. However the time it takes for the molecule to re-emit the wave varies. </p>
<p>If a molecule re-emits the wave fast enough, it will appear that nothing has changed, and the light just passed through. </p>
<p>If a molecule is too slow to emit, the new wave might vibrate in the opposite direction to the old wave, hence reducing the amount of light getting through. If the material is thick enough, no light will pass through at all, such as in wood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
