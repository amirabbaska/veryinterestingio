		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I was thinking about how people are more attracted to people who are in good shape and not fat. There are examples of obese unattractive people who put a lot of effort in and got in good shape and became attractive. With that being said, if a man were to get a women pregnant after losing the weight and getting in good shape, would that make a difference in the genetics of the children and their health, compared to if he had gotten a women pregnant while he was still obese? I'm wondering because if people are unattracted to obese people because that could imply bad genes, how would them getting in shape suddenly make them more attractive? Wouldn't the obese persons genes stay the same after getting in shape and thus result in the same potential baby? Or would it result in a healthier baby? Is an obese persons unattractiveness more related to the fact it shows the potential lack of ability to take care of a child? </p>
<p>I'm only talking about men because obviously a unhealthy woman during a pregnancy would result in a less healthy child. </p>
<p>TLDR: Why are obese people unattractive and if it has to deal with genes why is it possible for them to become attractive after getting in shape?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up something called Epigenetics. Epigenetics are the things that determine how your DNA is expressed. Epigenetics definitely changes on a generation by generation basis. We don't know a tremendous amount about it, but what studies we have done pretty strongly show that epigenetics can do things that normal DNA cannot. Such as making an offspring have an aversion to certain smells and chemicals based on what the parent experienced.</p>
<p>Here are two great videos on it:
One from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvB0q3mg4sQ" target="_blank">MinuteEarth(2:43)</a></p>
<p>And one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1bZEUgqVI" target="_blank">Scishow(9:28)</a></p>
<p>A great takeaway is that the changes in epigenetics were passed onto sperm cells. Therefore, eating healthier and losing weight not only makes you look better, but can also change your epigenetics, changing the way you build muscle, store fat, etc. </p>
<p>What is unknown is just how fast this happens. For example, it is unknown for how long someone has to be fit before there are significant changes in epigenetics to then be passed on to the children. </p>
<p>Edit: Never got around to explaining Epigenetics. The videos do a good job but the TLDW is that the Epigenome is a way of reading the DNA. The DNA doesn't change, but the Epigenome changes a lot based on how you act and behave. The Epigenome determines how strongly certain parts of the DNA get expressed. So essentially, take a person who went through a famine and survived, their epigenome will change to allow them to survive through extended starvation. This is then passed to their children and as a result, their children have a leg up on surviving a famine. There was even a study on this exact things done in Sweden. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind, which other comments so far have not mentioned, is that obese men more commonly struggle with infertility, and this continues to affect them even after they've gotten healthy, so to speak. The kids may or may not be healthier, but it's quite likely it will be harder to have them.</p>
<p>This next one is more anecdotal and should therefore be taken with a grain of salt. I've read about research that argues that the generation that was around for world war 1 and the roaring 20s were the first ones to access processed foods - but they were significantly skinnier than we are now. The theory was that the processed foods, with higher levels of fat and salt and sugar, affected their dna, and hurt their children and their grandchildren as well. I remember the study attempted this with mice, and it worked, but again - no clue. If true, then being obese at any point would also affect your reproductive health as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In all likelihood, yes.  Your genetics are less fixed than is commonly imagined, and the portions that are active at any given time can matter.</p>
<p>Research on mice and other animals has demonstrated that the physical fitness of the father at the time of conception does make a difference in the outcome of the children.  Replicating the research on humans is a bit tricky since you can't exactly force people to gain/lose weight and have children to fit the schedule of your research, but there is no reason to suspect that the same mechanisms won't hold true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On one hand, this sounds like an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism" target="_blank">Lamarkian genetics</a> (which proposed that acquired traits can be inherited).  And that line of thought was rejected ages ago in favor of Mendelian genetics.  </p>
<p>Well, rejected by almost everyone- the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/disastrous-effects-lysenkoism-soviet-agriculture" target="_blank">Soviets embraced the idea and it lead to famine that killed millions of people.</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, there's been a lot of work done in the field of epigenetics- changes in organisms created by gene expression instead of modification of the gene code itself.</p>
<p>It turns out that <a href="http://blog.episona.com/3-examples-transgenerational-epigenetic-inheritance/" target="_blank">acquired traits <em>can</em> be passed on</a> to the next generation. </p>
<p>It seems as if the experts don't have a definitive answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see several comments about the nature aspect, so I'll add a bit about nurture.  If your parents are obese, they likely have an unhealthy lifestyle and pass that lifestyle on to their children.  Their food choices and portions, the sedentary hobbies they pursue, it all factors into a child's health.  So a man losing a bunch of weight and living a healthier lifestyle will tend to affect his children positively. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
