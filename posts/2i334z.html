		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I own a few dry cleaning stores.  Dry clean machine is like a huge all-in-one washing machine that doesn't use water but use a special solvent.  It washes your garments, then blows heated air inside to dry them.  At the end of the cycle, the garments comes out cleaned and dried.  The solvent used to wash them are distilled in a distillation tank and reused.  The main reason you want to dry clean your clothe is because the solvent used in a dry clean machine does not shrink or re-shape your garments.  The solvent is also designed to be gentle for soft fabrics like silk.  But the heat used to dry your garments can and will melt cheap plastic decorations.  After the garment is dried, it is steam ironed in the old fashioned way by a person.</p>
<p>The solvent most dry clean machines use are tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), commonly called PERC.  Probably over 90% of the dry cleaning stores around you use that and it can cause cancer.  It is still widely used because it's cheap and still the best way to get your clothe clean.</p>
<p>We changed our machine to a hydrocarbon dry cleaning machine early last year.  The solvent this hydrocarbon dry clean machine doesn't cause cancer and is bio-degradable.  It cleans just as good as an old PERC machine but it runs almost twice as long to clean a load.  The old PERC machine could wash and dry your garments in about 35-45 minutes.  Our new machine takes as long as 80 minutes to finish a load.  The machine is also very expensive.  Cost more than twice what a good PERC machine would cost.</p>
<p>Most neighborhood dry cleaners can't afford to convert to more environmental and health friendly dry clean machines because they are usually individual owned.  A single family that operate one dry clean store simply don't make enough to pay for a $80,000+ machine.  Sometimes that's more than two years of earnings for that family.  I expended my store early and bought more stores to chain into my old store so I could afford to buy a new environmental and health friendly dry clean machine.  I also had a baby coming and wanted to be healthy for that too.</p>
<p>A few dry cleaners had also converted to &quot;Wet Cleaning&quot; machine.  It is basically a washer that uses water and set to &quot;extra gentle&quot; cycle.  I looked into it before I decided to buy the hydrocarbon dry clean machine.  There are some significant disadvantages with it.  First, its &quot;extra gentle&quot; cleaning cycle is not all that good at removing stains.  Second, &quot;wet cleaned&quot; garments shrink and can get damaged because they were washed with water.  They fix this with a special drying machine that dry and reshape each garment one after the one.  There's always a risk that some garments could shrink or be damaged too much to be reshaped by the drying machine.  I don't like that potential problem constantly hanging over me.  The machine itself can be cheaper than a regular PERC machine.  But for me, the disadvantages of &quot;Wet Cleaning&quot; far out weigh any advantages.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry cleaning is basically just like a large front load tumble drum washing machine with the exception that no water is used. That is what is implied by the &quot;dry&quot; part. But in reality the clothes get plenty &quot;wet&quot;, just not with water. There are many solvents that we use now other than the old traditional tetrachlorethylene. They are all safer and less toxic. But they are all still solvents that excel at removing oily stains. For other stains we usually add a bit of spotter chemical to the stain to pretreat. And we inject a specially blended detergent into the solvent to help break up and dissipate some stain solids like food or mud. The dry cleaning machine itself has one or more huge tanks where it stores the solvent. During the process the solvent runs through many filters to catch debris and keep the solvent as clean and fresh as possible. Some of these filters we change daily, weekly, monthly, and some every few months. </p>
<p>As a third generation dry cleaner the strangest part to me is that the &quot;dry cleaning&quot; is probably the least important part. Most of our customers could wash these items at home but then they would have to iron them which is the chore they don't want. Of course the ironing is easy for us because the solvent creates far fewer wrinkles than soap and water would, and we use huge expensive specialized presses that make getting out the wrinkles fast and easy. From our perspective as the folks doing the work the hardest part of the job is the effort we put into having to keep everything organized so after tumbling around with all your neighbor's clothes we can pull out only yours and get them back to you. </p>
<p>If any of you have any other questions about what we do and how we do it I would love to try and answer them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: water is a polar solvent and dry cleaning chemicals are non-polar solvents.</p>
<p>Too late for the thread, but here's the science if anyone's interested.</p>
<p>Simply think of a pretend scenario where you have to make the choice between using two different types of water to clean your clothes. Only one of the choices will remove the stain on your shirt. Think of plain old tap water as one of the choices and dry cleaning chemicals as the other choice. I will explain how water (a polar solvent) differs from dry cleaning chemicals (a non-polar solvent).</p>
<p>Don't get hung up on the term &quot;polarity&quot; it just describes the behavior of the two different types of &quot;water&quot; (two different choices of solvent, tap water or dry cleaning) that I'm going to describe below. (If you're interested: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity" target="_blank">polarity</a> occurs from the unequal sharing of electrons between atoms of different mass)</p>
<p>The ability to dissolve the stain on our shirt (solubility) is based on the principle that &quot;like dissolves like&quot;. One type of &quot;water&quot; dissolves one type of stain and the other dissolves the other type. (Polar solvents dissolve polar stains and non-polar solvents dissolve non-polar stains.)</p>
<p>Dry cleaning isn't necessarily &quot;dry&quot; it just uses a &quot;water&quot; (solvent) that's not tap water.</p>
<p>Stains are trapped particles between the cotton fibers of our shirt. We have to dissolve them to get them out.</p>
<p>How does the normal process of washing clothes at home get stains out?</p>
<p>Any kind of soap is a long molecule, like a snake, that has a polar head (usually a double bonded oxygen) and a tail with a long chain of non-polar atoms. The non-polar tail is able to interact with non-polar stains, completely surround it and lift it from the material like a bubble, while on the outside surface the polar heads interact with the solvent: water. This in effect, dissolves the non-polar stain into the polar solvent, water. </p>
<p>Stains that are not removed by water are non-polar. Grease, oils, and most hydrocarbons are non-polar.</p>
<p>Okay, so what makes dry cleaning different? Instead of fooling the water into dissolving the stain by surrounding the stains in a bubble of polar/non-polar soap molecules we can just remove the non-polar stain directly with a non-polar solvent like tetrachloroethylene (two carbon atoms bonded to four chlorine atoms). The non-polar solvent is able to directly remove (dissolve) the non-polar stain, without needing water or soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>dry cleaning uses chemicals that aren't water to clean fabric that would be too delicate to be washed with soap, water, and agitation. </p>
<p>most of the time it uses a non-flamable organic solvent called tetrachloroethylene. It's a really good solvent which is why they use it to clean clothes, unfortunately it is toxic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry cleaning involves soaking the clothes in a chemical solvent and lightly agitating it. It is used for clothes that are easy to damage when water and/or heat are used (wrinkling or warping).</p>
<p>In ancient Rome, they used ammonia from urine to clean their linens.
In the mid-19th century, kerosene was discovered to be an excellent solvent for the purpose of cleaning in clothes.
In the modern day, they use a chemical called PERC (short for PERChloroethylene), as it's much safer to use (it's nonflammable).</p>
<p>Today's &quot;dry cleaning&quot; also performs another step that most people would find difficult to do at home: pressing your clothes, so you don't have to risk ironing them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
