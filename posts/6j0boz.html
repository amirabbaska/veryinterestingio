		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general theory for this is that our brains thrive from predicting. This is why you might not like a song initially, but after a few more listens you start to love it because you can predict where the song will go next.</p>
<p>But it also works both ways; listening to a song hundreds of times results in  diminishing returns of satisfaction from predicting it, because it's become 'hard wired' into your brain. Then you take a short break, so you can enjoy the song again because you can't remember all of it anymore, and your brain enjoys trying to predict what will happen next again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three  important functions of our brain </p>
<ol>
<li>detect patterns
2, predict outcomes
3, detect change</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these help us to recognize / avoid danger</p>
<p>Our sensory systems are designed to respond when input changes- for example, when the thermostat of an  air conditioner goes on, we hear the hum.
And then when it goes off, we hear the silence. </p>
<p>These responses to change need to be noticed- since changing conditions are potentially  dangerous
After a minute of hum/ silence the receptors adapt and shut off. </p>
<p>On a higher level, when we listen to music or see art, we initially make predictions about what will come next.  When the music or art is unfamiliar, the next earful or eyeful is a surprise. So we attend closely . </p>
<p>Once the information becomes familiar, we can predict its entirety with a brief glance or short sample of sound.  It has no novelty and is becomes  less interesting. Even just seeing the title on a playlist evokes the memory of the entire composition.  We apply our attention to new information. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An equal question is why some songs don't impress us initially, but can grow on us after repeated hearings. I think the predictability plays are part here in opposite ways.</p>
<p>Back in the day The Rolling Stone would get prerelease's of albums to review them. Some of the best selling albums in history received poor reviews. Many of them are now on The Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time.</p>
<p>The Beatles often argued about future iconic songs and whether they should be put on an album because the guys that didn't write the songs thought it was subpar. (e.g. As my guitar gently weeps)</p>
<p>Also many super hits sit on the shelf for years even tho many hear it and pass on recording. The country song of the year Whiskey lullaby was like this. The Hallelujah Course written and recorded by Leonard Cohen was ignored for years by more mainstream recording artists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't listen to the radio much, so I mainly hear new songs and artists through my girlfriend or on weekends at a bar.</p>
<p>It's so frustrating hearing a song that has been out for a month and being told, &quot;This is so old, turn it off.&quot; Then they play Sweet Caroline or Wagon Wheel and the crowd goes nuts...</p>
<p>A song isn't old because it's over played.  The song is old to YOU because YOU overplay it/don't switch stations or press next on your playlist!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I put the same son on on repeat <em> and grind / kill mobs in coordination with the beat of the song </em><br />
My record is like 14 hours straight up one song on repeat while leveling from lvl 1 to 60 through mob grinding in wow </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
