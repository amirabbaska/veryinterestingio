		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question has some pseudo-scientific implications because, as you probably know, we can't move at the speed of light. </p>
<p>So let's say we're moving at 99.9999% the speed of light away from the Sun. If we look back at the Sun, what do we see? Well, first of all you probably wouldn't seem much because the light from the Sun would be redshifted by about z=1400. That is to say that the optical light that we see from the Sun (peaking at a wavelength of about 500 nm, green light) would be shifted into the sub-millimeter/radio part of the spectrum (at about 0.7 mm). So you wouldn't be able to see the Sun (or any other stars) whilst looking behind you.</p>
<p>What about looking in front of you? Well, at these speeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background</a> would be blueshifted from the microwave part of the spectrum to the infrared part of the spectrum. You would begin to see a red glow everwhere in front of you.</p>
<p>What if you were travelling <em>at</em> the speed of light? Well, like I said, you can't. &quot;But what if you could?&quot;... You can't. &quot;But <em>what if</em>?&quot;... OK, fine. <em>If</em> you were a photon travelling at the speed of light and looked behind you, what would you see? Photons probably don't experience time. (Note that this is all pseudo-science.) If our understanding of relativity holds for reference frames travelling at the speed of light, then a photon experiences infinite length contraction. It travels across the entire length of the Universe instantaneously in its own frame. So, you'd never have a chance to look behind you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were moving at the speed of light, you'd be operating outside of time. So you couldn't have a working body, or eyes or anything able to see with. Also, light would not be able to catch up to you, so you would not havr light fro anyhing coming into your eyes.  </p>
<p>Iow, you wouldnt be able to see, and even if you could, there would be nothing to see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
