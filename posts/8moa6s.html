		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in neuroscience research, on memory. This is a poorly understood process. One important thing to know about memory is that its dependent on context. That means that memories are more likely to recur in a similar environment or a similar emotional state to when they were formed. For example, returning to a place you haven't been in a while might evoke memories of things that happened there; or a song can cue memories associated with it. Lots of less helpful examples too around trauma and PTSD. </p>
<p>If you're actively trying to remember something, which is usually a strained sort of effort, you're not letting your brain work the way its best at remembering. As u/narcolepticaf pointed out, its often later that some other cue helps to trigger the desired memory. Importantly these aren't necessarily cues that you'd obviously link - it might just be thinking in a similar pattern, seeing a particular shape, smelling something, etc. </p>
<p>As I said, poorly understood, but the key is usually the context in which the memory was formed - return to the scene of the crime, literally or metpahorically  :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the term is cognitive blocking, but I may be mistaken. Basically you’re trying to remember say a name, and similar names pop into your head but none of them are right, so you have a hard time ignoring the incorrect names because they’re close. A little while latter, you may have completely forgotten about it by now, something loosely associated with the correct name reminds of you of it. But I’m not a neuroscientist, this is just from my psychology class from over a year ago. </p>
<p>Edit: I thought of an example:
Say you’re trying to remember someone’s name and it happens to be ‘Alice’. You know it starts with an ‘A’ so you start going through ‘A’ names, Abigail, Allie, Ariel, etc none of them are right, but now when you think of ‘A’ names, these are the ones that pop into your head most quickly, making difficult to change. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have theorized that it's because your brain can process problems even when you're not actively thinking about them. When you have trouble remembering something and then eventually give up trying, your brain kind of puts the request on hold for later. Then, when you're doing something seemingly random, your brain will experience some kind of cue (usually when you see or hear something related to the memory) and boom, you suddenly remember what it was that you were trying so hard for earlier. </p>
<p>Others theorize that while your brain has it on hold, it's actually searching through your subconscious memory like a sort of filing system. (But most think the first theory is much more likely)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
