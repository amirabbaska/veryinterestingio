<li>Nothing they do can affect total torque or momentum of the station.</li>
<li>They theoretically could change internal torque distribution (eg. by running in circles) and thus cause the station to start spinning, which could increase drag, and cause some orbital changes. In fact this happens with treadmills there!</li>
<li>ISS has CMGs - gyros which can control the torque, so they can counteract spinning and stabilize he station.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is conserved in a closed system. People in the ISS can't permanently change its trajectory by moving around. They push off one wall, sending it in the opposite direction but then they must necessarily then hit the other wall, undoing what they did. The center of mass momentum of the station+occupants is fixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can alter its trajectory for at most a second or two, because once they stop moving their momentum is transferred back to the station (either directly by their own impact or indirectly by air movement). It's effectively a closed system, so momentum is conserved.</p>
<p>Even during that brief moment, the effect is tiny. The ISS's mass is around 420,000 kg; an astronaut probably weighs no more than 60 or 70 kg tops (less, I'd guess, since muscle atrophies in space and is a significant contributor to weight). Since they're moving no more than a meter per second, they're only changing the station's velocity by something like 0.0015 m/s, which is a tiny amount relative to its ~7,670 m/s orbital velocity.</p>
<p>So while I've never seen any official point addressing this, I'm almost certain the answer is &quot;no&quot;, because you're changing its velocity by at most one part in ~50 million for only a second or two per motion. Even in spaceflight, you don't generally get precision on those levels: for scale, one part in 50 million compared to the ISS' <em>altitude</em> is a difference of...eight meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you ignore air resistance then there is nothing the crew inside can do to alter the orbit.(if they dont throw anything out of the station that is)</p>
<p>but if you include it im pretty sure they could alter it in a tiny way by moving upwards, having the station move downwards thus having it experience more drag since the air is denser there. but this effect should be miniscule because of the mass ratio and the tiny increase in air densitiy.</p>
<p>but just to show that a change is possible in principle:</p>
<p>imagine that the orbit of the station is perfectly circular and the lowest point of the station is at X meters and that we have a pole at some point in the orbit that is (X m - 1mm) high. which means that is just barely doesnt get hit by the station. if a person in the station pushes himself upwards, the station moves downwards as to conserve momentum causing it to hit the pole and crash. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
