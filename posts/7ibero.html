		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is currently a myopia &quot;epidemic&quot;. See <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120" target="_blank">here</a>. There is certainly a genetic component to myopia, but it's not that suddenly a lot more myopia genes are being passed on in the last few years. A common lay theory is that there might be an effect of close-up work (books, computers), but the effects are small or non-existent according to some of the studies linked in the article. However, there is a correlation with education level. Some very recent work (again, linked in the article above) suggests that what matters is time spent outdoors (and not related to focusing far away -- I really recommend reading the linked article) -- in particular, exposure to bright light. However, there is no strong consensus at the moment of what exactly is the main cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a study done a number of years ago trying to figure out why myopia was becoming much more common in places like China over the past few decades. After examining a number of factors, they determined the the main problem was the lack of sunlight children and young adults were exposed to. As long as children and young adults spent a good amount of time in sunlight (as everyone in pre-modern times did), there was a low incidence of myopia.</p>
<p>It has been thought in the past that myopia has to do with reading books or spending too much time looking at things a short distance away (e.g. screens). The study didn't find that to be the case. However, they did find that doing things like reading books was negatively correlated with being outside (spending too much time indoors was the real culprit). So, it's not hard to see why people thought that reading was a cause of myopia. You can spend lots of time reading books and have eyes develop normally, as long as you also spend a fair amount of time outdoors in the bright light.</p>
<p>So, it's likely that myopia was rare in pre-modern times.</p>
<p>Here's some sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To our surprise, more time outdoors had a protective effect and reduced the chances that a child would go on to need myopic refractive correction. The size of the effect was impressive.
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/playing-outside-seems-to-help-kids-vision/2017/11/10/b3b66f42-adcf-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/playing-outside-seems-to-help-kids-vision/2017/11/10/b3b66f42-adcf-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html</a></p>
<p>In the latter case, the epidemiological studies that have examined children's exposure to outdoors have consistently found a [myopia] preventative effect for between 10-14 hours outside per week in addition to any hours spent outside during school time</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Our hypothesis that the mechanism of the effect of light was mediated by retinal dopamine, a known inhibitor of eye growth whose release is stimulated by light, has also been supported by animal experiments. All of these studies confirm a consistent link between the time spent outdoors and the prevention of myopia, possibly crucially mediated by the at least ten-fold increase in light levels between indoor lighting and being outside. So yes, it is highly likely that there is a direct connection between time spent outside and preventing myopia.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, I think you overestimate the negative impact of myopia, even to the extent it might have been more or less prevalent. </p>
<p>Human eyesight is among the best in the animal kingdom. If I remember correctly, only birds routinely have superior eyesight to humans, with other mammals having far worse eyesight, at least in terms of resolution at a particular distance.</p>
<p>While it would certainly be disadvantageous compared to another human with better eyesight, and might concievably interfere with reading social cues, it's not some something that would be a death sentence in &quot;the wild.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the coolest study is where they glued minus lenses infront of chickens eyes at birth and found that their vision stabilised equal to the power of that minus lens. (ie adapted to the extra lens and had good vision again)</p>
<p>A cool idea (ethics approval pending). Would be to put plus lenses in front of all babies who may be at risk of myopia. Their eye would stabilise to be hyperopic (long sighted) not myopic. However their genetic myopic factors may reduce this degree long sightedness to something close to emmetropic (normal).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception about evolution and traits.</p>
<p>Simplest answer -&gt; Having a small defect or X defects are irrelevant unless they are bad enough to get you killed.  </p>
<p>Then a high enough % of people need to have died before breeding for it to exit the gene pool...which could be prevented by several beneficial traits and/or wealth.</p>
<p>This is why you see so many unfavorable traits still existing.  Evolution gives us both good and bad, not just all good.  And the bad only leave when its bad enough to kill us en masse.<br />
Even then, the same issue could occur.  We don't just evolve away from bad eyesight - because lots of things cause bad eyesight and our genes are ever changing.  Especially if we can manage to survive with poor eyesight.</p>
<p>So even if selective breeding killed off X, X could still come back.</p>
<p>`Anyway
At 200/400 vision, if this was the past I could still see well enough to shoot a deer at a closer distance.<br />
I wouldn't need to even bother if one of my clan mates had decent eye sight and I could do something else for the tribe in exchange for food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
