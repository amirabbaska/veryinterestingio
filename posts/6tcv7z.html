		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of animal (wild v. domestic) but the majority of the time they mean never before discovered. But discovered can mean different things, maybe it a species that we've never seen before or maybe it's an animal that we misclassified. An example of this is the platypus, after genetic testing it is though that there are two subspecies not one species as originally thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the way you phrased your question, the answer is; yes.</p>
<p>Often when talking about newly discovered species it's either a newly discovered specimen classified as it's own species or a known one that turns out to have been falsely counted towards one species but it actually a new (or sometimes a known) different species.</p>
<p>A new 'breed' of domesticated animal is often the result of selective breeding or cross breeding. </p>
<p>Edit: what /u/Science_is_punny said (I wonder why it said 0 comments.. That comment is 4 hours old) </p>
<p>Edit 2: /u/exotics and /u/FancyScientist made excellent points; breeds and species are used in different contexts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are like 30-something officially proposed species definitions, ranging from ones based on the ability of organisms to reproduce to ones based solely on genetic variation. In modern times, often when a new species is discovered it is a 'cryptic' species. Cryptic species are groups of animals that are morphologically and ecologically similar, differing mainly in behavior. When the behavioral barriers to gene flow are strong enough, it can cause the genomes of two populations to diverge enough so that despite looking the same and having the same environment and even having the ability to produce totally fertile and healthy offspring, they don't because of the behavioral differences. These cryptic species are usually only revealed after sampling individuals from the wild and comparing genomic variation. Edit: grammar</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The meta to this is that our definition of &quot;species&quot; is outdated and predates modern genetics. Your question has a messy answer because the system itself is messy. At some point it needs to be updated based on genetic similarities, not external cues like morphology (shape). </p>
<p>Speciation is a process, a slow divergence from an arbitrary set of ancestors. In that sense, everything is a bunch of crossbreeds. We'll never be able to describe all life because life keeps evolving faster than we can keep up with. It's just an arbitrary definition of when an individual has mutated enough to become a new species. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a big planet with lots of stuff in it.  We have yet to catalog it all.  Even if someone has been living next door to a common local bug/fish/bird/mammal that does not mean that it has been identified and cataloged by taxonomists.  So, if a biologist trips over something new in their neighbors backyard, it does not necessarily mean it is new and undiscovered but instead it may mean that it just has not been categorized all official like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
