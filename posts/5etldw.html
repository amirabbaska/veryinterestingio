I've seen many breasts in my lifetime but something about the shape and mass of this one sparked the question. I did think about the fat theory but as we've all seen, online at the very least, that some girls are skinny with large breasts, and bellies and butts in these thin women are never 2x-4x larger in size compared to other skinny women with small breasts. And many mention dicks but generally speaking they don't vary in size to such a degree. Even in the inspired picture, her breasts are closer to 6x larger then some, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8PLwg5j.jpg" target="_blank">Keira Knightley</a> [<strong>NSFW</strong>] is a wonderful example. </p>
<p>There were a lot of explanations as to the how, but the root of the question is to the why. Why are breasts, in particular, a evolutionary free for all. Well.... With that being said, I say, set them free.</p>
<p>Excellent responses ladies and gentlemen. I think every man should know this so when a woman removes her push up bra, he'll understand better as to where the tits went, and every woman should know this so they understand better as to why their BFF Stacy has bigger ones then hers and to help minimize confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time for my evolutionary biology degree to shine! </p>
<p>Like some posters already mentioned, they vary by body weight, genetics, etc., but that doesn't get to the root cause. Why are they so variable in the first place? Ears, for example, are almost identical sizes across a population, and they don't really have a very serious function or bones to hold them together. </p>
<p>They key factor that has been missing from this discussion is <strong>symmetry</strong>! Breasts are under sexual selection, that is, natural selection not by what makes you &quot;fittest&quot; but by what makes you more &quot;sexy&quot; to others in your species. Large breasts are preferred, but asymmetric breasts are strongly disliked. The balance between these is what makes breasts so &quot;unstable&quot; as a trait in humans.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S0162-3095\(97\)00002-0/abstract" target="_blank">Here is an incredibly relevant paper, from 1997.</a> I'll break down the abstract for you below. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breasts in humans are highly sexually dimorphic compared to other closely related primate species. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means, human males and human females have markedly more different breast sizes than similar species </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One possible explanation for this increase in breast size is that breast asymmetry contains information regarding women's phenotypic quality. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presents the hypothesis: that breast asymmetry is a signal for the overall &quot;quality&quot; of the woman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this work was to consider the relationship between asymmetry and measures of body size, body composition, and fertility. We found significant associations between breast asymmetry and height, body mass, and breast volume (positive associations), breast “density” (negative association), and the woman's age and her age at first childbirth (positive associations). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What they actually found: asymmetric breasts are more common in tall, heavy women, in larger but less dense breasts, and more common in older women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relationship between asymmetry and breast volume showed evidence of negative allometry, that is, women with large breasts had smaller asymmetry than expected for their breast size. Asymmetry was lower in married women compared to unmarried women and negatively related to offspring number. A multiple regression analysis, with breast asymmetry as the dependent variable, showed a strong significant relationship with breast volume (positive association) and significant relationships with age at first childbirth (positive association) and number of offspring (negative association). Asymmetric women therefore had fewer children later in life that did symmetric women. Simple linear and multiple regression analysis showed that breast volume was a strong predictor of body size and composition (weight, height, and breast density) and a weak predictor of age and age at menarche. It was not related to offspring number or age at first childbirth. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is some added proof to back up their theory, saying that small breasts are even more symmetrical than you'd expect, and that married women with lots of children had symmetrical breasts. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our data support the thesis that mammotropic hormones, particularly estrogen, are harmful because they suppress the immune system. Heavy women with high levels of body fat produce more estrogen and, therefore, bigger breasts. However, more estrogen leads to an increase in breast asymmetry. Women with “good genes” are able to produce symmetric breasts despite the presence of large quantities of estrogen. Large and symmetric breasts are therefore honest signals of high phenotypic quality in women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally their conclusion: big breasts are good, but the way to make them is to have more estrogen, and that also means more asymmetry. Because estrogen weakens the immune system, it's bad for the overall &quot;quality&quot; of the woman. So only women with very good genes and very good health can have breasts that are both large and symmetrical. Because it's easy for parts of this to go wrong, you get lots of variability. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's talk <em>sexual selection,</em> the more fun and less gruesome (but equally merciless) sister of <em>natural selection</em>.</p>
<p>To go straight to the most famous and clear example, breasts have the same challenge as the peacock's tail: bigger is often better (although it's also a matter of proportion etc and in the modern human world cultural preference and experience might be relevant too), but on the one hand it has side effects and on the other only genetically good individuals can successfully pull it off. It takes the right balance to get there and of course you also need to survive once you have it.</p>
<p>To go to the peacock: in general (and a tad simplified), the bigger the tail the more likely female peacock's will mate with a male. But symmetry is also important and the male also has to be in good health - and bad health shows first and foremost in weak colours and damage of the tail. So the male with a smaller but symmetric tail and good health is more likely to reproduce than the one with a bigger but less symmetric tail and/or worse health. Either one has a chance, but <em>on average and/or over many generations</em> this effect is measurable. There is also a natural limit (which might be somewhat changed by eg modern medicine) where a peacock's large tail/a woman's large breast might not just be difficult for the body to 'do well' but will also negatively affect health and survival - eg women with big breasts have plenty of back problems (and in a world without clothes might more quickly show their age weigh sagging breasts...) and peacocks with big tails will have trouble escaping predators and keeping themselves healthy and alive. So only genetically good individuals (or in modern humans this might also be those with access to resources, eg through well-off parents that had good food &amp; medical access - this is an alternative or <em>additional</em> marker of mate quality) will be able to sustain such a feature in a good quality until mate choice/reproduction.</p>
<p>In evolutionary theory those are considered 'honest signals'. - they are desirable features but not every individual can show them to the same degree. This they form an important element in sexual selection - the more 'choosy' a species is the more important are such signals. Another example are large antlers in deer and moose or complicated songs and unusually long and colourful feathers in some bird species.</p>
<p>Last note: in humans the female hip-to-waist ratio seems to be a more important and stable marker for genetic quality (or rather: fertility). There is not just some modern scientific evidence for the correlation (it's not a direct link - the right hip to weight ratio does not improve fertility, rather both are affected by the underlying health from gestation onwards), but even across art of all centuries the same ratios are popular - even when tastes for overall bodyweight, including the usually somewhat weight-proportional breast size, changed over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple of factors that influence breast size and shape:</p>
<p>-The genes you inherit and your weight during adolescence (edit: this prob affects density more than size) are pretty strong influencers of final core size at the end of puberty.</p>
<p>-Then you have your current body fat % which will change things further.</p>
<p>-Finally there's also a development stage when you either first get pregnant or go on certain contraceptive pills. If you never get pregnant or go on that pill you don't undergo this.</p>
<p>The genetics is pretty interesting, 23andme did a study which discovered some of the variants that increase breast size (The poster: <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Genetic-Variants-Associated-with-Breast-Size-and-Cancer.pdf" target="_blank">https://blog.23andme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Genetic-Variants-Associated-with-Breast-Size-and-Cancer.pdf</a> and the article <a href="http://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-13-53" target="_blank">http://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-13-53</a> ). We Humans pick the person to have sex with in a semi non-random fashion (unless drunk) but also the cultural perception of desirability (aka whether people in your nation like boobs or bums or ankles) varies (the <del>Romans</del> Greeks for example thought large penises were silly and unattractive) so the size of a body part which is not crucial to survival and reproductive success (because most of us in the end want to have our kids with the girl who isn't crazy rather than the girl with the biggest boobs) isn't going to be under very strong selection when other factors matter more.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Added the article.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit 2: I'm told it's the Greeks that liked small penises</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hands and feet size is determined by bone growth. Unless there is a medical issue like giantism, bones are only going to get so big. Boobs don't have bones in them, they're full of fat and mammary glands. Fat CAN keep growing. Think about how a person's stomach or arms can be 4x larger than another person's. This is also why your breasts can grow or shrink when you gain or lose weight. Feet aren't going to get shorter when you lose weight, though they can get less &quot;puffy&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
