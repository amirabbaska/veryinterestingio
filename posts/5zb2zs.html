Depression is like swimming in very heavy clothing.  It takes all of my energy to resist sinking so that I can keep breathing (i.e., take care of my most basic needs).  There isn't enough energy left to move in any direction.  Sometimes I can summon the energy to call for help; most of the time not.  Medication strips off some of the clothes but not enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(another one I have tried).  Depression is like feeling the misery from the worst experience you can imagine, without remembering what that experience was.  Like having total amnesia while still feeling massive shock from watching your house burn down with your loved ones inside, on the same day that you also got fired and discovered that you have a terminal illness.  You can't remember why, but you know that everything good in the world is gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran into this a year or so ago, and to me, this is the simplest way I saw to describe it.  It doesn't start with &quot;Depression is like...&quot;, but I hope this helps. </p>
<p>&quot; I once tried to explain depression to someone as like if one day you gradually started to lose both your sense of taste and your ability to feel full. And you don’t know why, but now everything you eat tastes like mashed potatoes and nothing you eat is satisfying. You keep eating because you must eat to live, but the effort that it takes to prepare food is taxing and there is no pay off. You just know it will taste like mashed potatoes. You just know you will still be hungry. So you stop bothering with seasonings. Then you stop bothering to use ingredients you used to like. Then you start to wonder what the point of eating is because there is no payoff. You still feel hungry and you’re sick of the taste and you don’t know if you will ever enjoy food again and you don’t know why this is happening.</p>
<p>If someone comes up to you in this scenario and says, “Well have you tried spicing your food? Using different ingredients? Eating foods you used to love?” It isn’t necessarily helpful because the reason you stopped doing all that in the first place is that everything…tasted…like mashed…potatoes.&quot; -57circlesofhell, Tumblr</p>
<p>I get where you're coming from. I grew up in a religious household. I have depression that borders on manic. It was always demons taunting me, and If I just prayed, I'd get better. I tried to get help from my family, and my dad told me I was being a dramatic teenager, and my step-mom told me it was part of being a woman. Years later and no better, she asked if therapy would help and I asked her to give me a little bit to think about it because therapy would make my problem real, and something I had to actually deal with, and that scared me. When I came to her about it (a few hours later, mind you), she told me that therapists were scam artists, and that the Lord was the only one who could help me get better. </p>
<p>Again, I really hope that helped. It helped me when speaking to former partners. Some people just can't be convinced that it is a real disease and not just a bad day though. If you ever need to talk, just send me a message. I get on here fairly frequently, and make it a point to try and help others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This David Foster Wallace quote: </p>
<p>The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.</p>
<p>Short version: like being trapped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depression is like...</p>
<p>...any other disease, such as Cancer.  We can't just will our mental health back, any more than a Cancer sufferer can wish for remission.  It's an ailment like any other.  </p>
<p>I've been having trouble getting any help, and I always tell the people brushing me off: if my leg was broken, you'd fast-track a medevac helicopter right this second to help me. </p>
<p>I'm in Canada so all this shit is free, but mental health is still stigmatized, no matter how many campaigns they try. And if treatments fail, they deem us 'cured' because there's nothing left to try.  How ass-backwards is that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
