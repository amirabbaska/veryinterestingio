		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> In general, the maximum size of a mountain on a planet will be limited by surface gravity. The greater the surface gravity, the smaller the biggest mountain can be. On earth, it works out that Everest is probably pretty close to this limit. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> As a mountain gets taller, it gets more massive. As it gets more massive, the pressure on the rock at its base increases. Eventually, this pressure would exceed the breaking strength of the rock. </p>
<p>That pressure could be written</p>
<pre><code>P = rho g h</code></pre>
<p>where <em>P</em> is the pressure on the base, <em>rho</em> is the density of the rock, <em>g</em> is the surface gravity of the planet, and <em>h</em> is the height of the mountain. If <em>P</em> is the breaking strength of the rock, you'll find a cool relation:</p>
<pre><code>h g = P/rho</code></pre>
<p>Since <em>P/rho</em> is just a constant, this relation tells us that <strong>as the surface gravity of the planet in question increases, the maximum size of a mountain it can support decreases.</strong></p>
<p>This also tells us <em>h g</em> must also be a equal to a constant, which lets us relate the maximum height of mountains on planets of similar compositions but with different masses:</p>
<pre><code>h_1 g_1 = h_2 g_2</code></pre>
<p>You can do something <em>really cool</em> with this. If you take Mt Everest to be the tallest mountain that can be supported on earth, and if you know that Mars surface gravity is 2/5th of earth surface gravity, you can actually calculate the height of Olympus Mons, which is the tallest mountain on Mars, if you write </p>
<pre><code>h_everest g_earth / g_mars = h_olympusmons

5/2 h_everest = h_olympusmons</code></pre>
<p>Which is actually really close to the true value! This is even cooler because it argues that <em>both</em> Earth and Mars have mountains near the maximum possible height for the planet. Of course, a geologist may not like any of what I just said above. Mountains and tectonic plates and mantles are complicated beasts - this was just a first order approximation.</p>
<p>But, as one last fun fact, you can do something else with this approximation. <a href="http://quarksandcoffee.com/index.php/2015/10/29/why-are-some-moons-spherical-but-others-are-shaped-like-potatoes/" target="_blank">We can predict the 'potato radius' - the maximum size a 'potato shaped' asteroid can be before its gravity becomes strong enough to pull it into a sphere.</a> This is done by modeling the potato asteroid as a sphere with a <em>huge</em> mountain on it that must shrink as the asteroid grows in mass, until the mountain is smaller than the radius of the asteroid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The height of the crust (i.e., mountain plus the solid rock below; a solid) is compensated for by the thickness of the underlying mantle (a fluid), such that the whole of the earths surface (crust plus mantle; solid plus fluid) seeks to be in equilibrium (what geologists called &quot;isostatic equilibrium&quot;). Isostatic equilibrium can take thousands or even millions of years to occur, yet the mountain building processes can happen more quickly than equilibrium (in some cases) and so, in a sense, the mountain belts are always delayed by some timeframe from being in equilibrium. I'd have to dig up my old global tectonics, geophysics, or structural geology texts but in essence the height of Everest is related to several factors including the thickness of the crust under it (in this case, very thick), the density of the crust, the density of the mantle and thickness of the mantle, the timeframe for equilibrium, and of course erosion plays a huge part too that changes the thickness of the crust on a rapid timeframe. Here's a version of the basic equation that governs the relationship:</p>
<p>Sum of (Density<em>gravity</em>thickness) for one vertical profile through the earth = sum of (density<em>gravity</em>thickness) of another vertical profile through the earth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the base of the mountain, the stress due to all the rock material on the top should be less than the shearing strain at which the rock begins to flow. The correspondibg strain can be estimated as follows:<br />
Suppose, the height of a mountain is h and the density of its rock is rho. Then the force per unit area at the base due to the weight of the mountain is h.rho.g. The material at the base expiriences this force per unit area in the vertical direction, but the sides of the mountain are free. Hence the mountain suffers a shearing strain approximately of the order of h.rho.g.<br />
Now the elastic limit of a typical rock is 3×10^8 Nm^-2 and the density is about 3×10^3 kg m^-3. Therefore,<br />
h(max).rho.g = 3×10^8 Nm^-2<br />
h(max) = 3×10^8 Nm^-2 ÷ 3×10^3 kgm^-3 × 9.8 N kg^-1<br />
Which is nearly 10^4 m
It is nearly the height of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My opinion as an astronomer and physicist that likes rigorous definitions:</p>
<p>If a rock/asteroid is larger than about 600km in diameter, gravity will cause it to collapse into a spherical object. </p>
<p>A lot of asteroids have all kind of different shapes up to that size.</p>
<p>So, if a mountain exists on a round planet, its size is severely limited by gravity. This scenario is well described by others in this thread. On a small rock with corresponding low gravity, however, the limit is basically the entire rock up to about 600km.</p>
<p>So, unless you have a limiting definition of what a mountain is, the best answer will be 600km</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
