		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How deep can it be?</p>
<p>Very deep. Over half a mile, perhaps as much as mile under very special circumstances. </p>
<p>The thickness of sand under the dunes is going to depend on the length of time that deposition was greater than erosion. In a desert, deposition = sand being blown in, and erosion=sand being blown out. If you were to measure these rates in (thickness)/(time), you can imagine that it is possible to get a lot of sand built up in short times relatively speaking. However, the rate of erosion will increase if you build sand &quot;up&quot;-- so what you need is accommodation space where sand can accumulate. </p>
<p>And there are thick sandstones, such as those that form the ancient geology of the American west, which you can see at parks such as <a href="https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm" target="_blank">Arches</a> in Utah. When you see all the rocks at Arches, you are seeing a HUGE pile of what remains of thousands and thousands of sand dunes that were partially buried in accommodation space provided by evacuating salt. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Sandstone" target="_blank">The Navajo Sandstone</a> is up to 2,300 ft thick, but it's been compressed--it would have been thicker before it was buried and re-exposed. And, there is some additional amount of material that would have been on top that has eroded. So, at <em>least</em> half a mile.</p>
<p>But also very cool--the Navajo sandstone was being deposited over a period of 15 million years, so the net rate of addition might have been around 2,300 ft/15 million years = 1/10000 ft/year. That's a tiny net amount, and we know that accumulation happened in fits and starts--there are packages that are the &quot;base&quot; of sand dunes that are 30' thick that show all their original structure, which means that 30' thick sand dune was laid down millions of years ago and never reactivated. So it was a lot of boring time and then <em>boom</em>, your sand dune gets buried and stays. </p>
<p>Why was there so much sand accumulation there? The answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_tectonics" target="_blank">salt tectonics</a>. If you fill up a basin with sea water and keep evaporating, you can end up with salt a mile thick. Then, if you blow sand over it, you end up with a sandy desert dune on top of your mile thick salt. And here's the cool thing: sand dunes are denser than salt <em>so they start sinking into it</em>. That's where the accommodation space comes from! </p>
<p>One last thing: these thick sands are great places to hold oil, and have been important targets of exploration all across the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top answer is totally correct, but from your wording, it sounded like you were asking about unconsolidated (loose) material. Sandstones, by definition, are not so loose as to be dune-forming. They might be buried dunes that have subsequently lithified, but they are not necessarily associated with desert environments—they’re buried beaches, or other sandy environments—which brings us to dunes.</p>
<p>Dunes are loose sand (or other grain sizes) that pile up in a sub aerial (ie on land) environment. They form by the same process as ripples on a beach, that is, they scale to the energy of the body that moves them. Ripples scale to the waves over top of them, and dunes scale to the air masses that move them. That means that some dunes scale to the troposphere! That isn’t to say that we have Everest-sized sand dunes on Earth, but rather, that sand dunes may be up to kilometers thick, depending on the strength of the wind that pushes them, among other factors. Those might include the amount of source material available, and the qualities of the source material itself (rounded vs angular grains, etc.)</p>
<p>Good luck, and I hope this answers your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deserts are typically defined by precipitation amount (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert" target="_blank">ref</a>), and therefore do not require any sand at all (e.g., Antarctica). The amount of sediment transported in deserts is a function of sediment supply, sediment source, wind strength, wind direction, and local vegetation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_processes" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825206001449" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas_Lancaster/publication/269940573_Late_Pleistocene_and_Holocene_dune_activity_and_wind_regimes_in_the_western_Sahara_Desert_of_Mauritania_Comment_and_Reply_REPLY/links/549db0530cf2d6581ab64045/Late-Pleistocene-and-Holocene-dune-activity-and-wind-regimes-in-the-western-Sahara-Desert-of-Mauritania-Comment-and-Reply-REPLY.pdf" target="_blank">3</a>). </p>
<p>The Jurassic to Triassic sand seas (<a href="https://sed.utah.edu/Wingate.htm" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://sed.utah.edu/Navajo.htm" target="_blank">2</a>) preserved in western North America were [ergs](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_(landform" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_(landform</a>) that were up to hundreds of meters deep (<a href="http://offices.colgate.edu/bselleck/Geology120/NavajoB.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://sed.utah.edu/Wingate.htm" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://sed.utah.edu/Navajo.htm" target="_blank">3</a>), so presumably toward the end of the dune fields' lives they could have been that deep. That's probably about as thick as they come, and as others have mentioned in this thread, the Sahara is probably less thick than these older deserts. </p>
<p>A cooler question posed elsewhere in this thread: What's under all that sand?
The sand in deserts will blanket lowlands first, until topography levels off. Sometimes that means that just areas near river banks are covered with sand dunes during multidecadal to multimillennial draughts (e.g., <a href="http://www.argonaut.arizona.edu/articles/holliday2001b.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://geo.msu.edu/extra/arbogast/documents/GreatBendDunesPaper.pdf" target="_blank">2</a>). Large dune fields will cover pre-existing topography, including river valleys, settlements/towns, rock outcrops, and whatever else is around (cool examples <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/218/4576/1004" target="_blank">1</a>, [2] (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08006924" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08006924</a>), and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ake_Rosenqvist/publication/278736163_Mapping_subsurface_geology_in_arid_areas_using_L-band_orbital_radar/links/55c00ec208aed621de13a60c.pdf" target="_blank">3</a>). Perhaps the most crazy thing ever is <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/46/1/91/522864/an-exhumed-paleozoic-glacial-landscape-in-chad" target="_blank">a recent paper</a> describing a very large, exhumed landscape from the late Paleozoic in Chad that contains evidence of at least five glacial &quot;ice rivers&quot;--this is a landscape many hundreds of millions of years old, and you could just walk around on it as if it were a time capsule. What the heck?</p>
