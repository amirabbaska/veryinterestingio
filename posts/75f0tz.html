		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially different meats are subjected to different bacteria throughout their life, as well as during their slaughter and processing. Because of this, different legislation and regulatory levels are applied differently to meats. Chicken is of particular concern due to salmonella being present throughout the meat itself instead of just a surface contaminant which it is in beef. Therefore cooking beef, even just searing the outside ensures the bacteria will be killed, chicken however must be cooked entirely through. In the EU if salmonella is present on beef steak for example it is still fit for human consumption because it is assumed proper cooking will be performed to eliminate the surface contamination. If the beef is minced however and a positive result for salmonella is found, the meat will be reject because the salmonella will be present throughout the minced meat, not just the surface. Seafood contains different bacteria but are often very dangerous as well because they tend to concentrate bacteria present within dirty water. Therefore they are often placed in fresh clean water to filter themselves before being sent for human production. Fish are a concern because they tend to eat other fish resulting in bioaccumulation of bacteria and chemicals dangerous to humans. No meat is 100% safe for consumption, it's all about risk reduction and trying to ensure proper management from the farm level, the hygienic slaughter, cold chain refrigeration from slaughter to customer to ensure conditions which do not favour bacterial growth.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Where I live it's not allowed to serve raw fish that hasn't been frozen to -20C for at least 24 hours first to kill off parasites. This includes fish used in sushi dishes of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, there are some seafoods that shouldn't be undercooked, starting with crustaceans. </p>
<p>Secondly, it's because beef doesn't usually have the same risk of pathogens that chicken does. Chicken very often has salmonella, which cooking destroys. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can eat raw chicken, it's just risky, due in large part to the handling and rearing practices which encourage salmonella presence in the meat.</p>
<p>I have had raw chicken in a specialty restaurant in Tokyo, where presumably the chicken is raised and handled in a safe manner, and experienced no illness from it.  And it was surprisingly good!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
