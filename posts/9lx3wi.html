		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Corruption happens for lots of reasons. Think of each file as a million light switches. The order in which the light switches are on or off tells the computer what is inside the file. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the light switches were stored I'm a giant steel box then whenever you went to look at them they would be in the same order. In a perfect world, someone could open that box, copy the order of switches into a new box, and then close their box for a perfect copy. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Imagine if you started to copy the switch order to a new and something interrupted you, or the box you were copying from was removed. If this was towards the end of the switches, you would think you might think you had a copy, but would be missing pieces of it.  This is how files can get corrupted while copying though most programs have a method to verify the switches were copied correctly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When something on your computer is running, it stores those switches in a temporary box that is really fast to change, but also really sensitive. Imagine if you shook the box with a bunch of rocks in it. Theres a chance that while you're shakeing the box, one of the rocks would hit a switch and change it at random. This is what can happen with data while it's in memory, sometimes background radiation can hit one of the electrons and change it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every time you save or retrieve data there is a chance that someone along the line some piece of hardware will incorrectly read the data or incorrectly write the data. Computers do a lot to check if this happened and correct it, but occasionally something will cause an undetectable issue and that is viewed as corruption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underneath the model of digital signals, it's really an analog world. Circuits assign meaning to low voltages (zero) and high voltages (one), but voltages near the middle will look like zeros to some circuits and ones to others. Circuits have amplifiers that try to take small analog errors on their inputs and eliminate them, driving outputs back to voltages that are clearly ones and zeros. However, these circuits are themselves built in an analog world, where the threshold between ones and zeros, amplifier gains, transistor saturation, logic function delays, power supply voltage and similar characteristics vary due to manufacturing variation, focusing error, microscopic dirt on the chip and the like. Signal-to-noise ratios are kept normally high enough that digital errors are rare, but variations from ideal behavior large enough to cause errors happen. Most computers make no attempt to correct individual errors in computation, except for data stored in memories and possibly in caches.</p>
<p>One particular problem that leads to corruption is circuit delays. As discussed above, after manufacture, logic circuits have varying delays for many reasons as described above. We build computers to be fast. Really fast. Really, as fast as we can make them. We rely on clock signals to capture logic signals once the circuits have computed a result, but a circuit that's too slow will cause the wrong answer to be captured when the clock signal arrives. That's why overclocked computers can result in corruption - they're being operated beyond the point at which the logic signals have settled to their stable values.</p>
<p>Disk drives have servo circuits that try to keep the read and write heads on tracks for the best signal-to-noise ratio, and when the heads are little out of place, the drive reads values that are a little off, and once a written zero comes back as a one, or vice versa, raw data has been corrupted. Disk drives in particular rely upon error-correction coding, so individual  errors and some combination errors in the raw data can be detected and corrected, but once the error rate gets too high, that corruption gets passed out of the disk drive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software programmer here! There are two main types of corruption: hardware and software. Hardware corruption is when hardware malfunctions, and can be from anything the hardware wearing out to losing power in the middle of things. However, software can also get corrupt through programming bugs.</p>
<p>When you write software in C and C++, you have direct access to the computer's memory. You can literally ask the computer to allocate a certain number of bytes for you. However, the cost of this level of control is that you have to give the memory back to the computer when you are done. Not doing so results in a memory leak, where your program takes more memory the longer it runs. On the other hand, corruption results from giving the memory back to your computer and then using it afterwards, giving it back to the computer more than once, or using more memory than the computer gave you.</p>
<p>Say you ask the computer for enough memory to store four numbers. Then immediately after, you create an unrelated integer, x, and set it to 7. Then you tell the computer that the fifth number in your list of four numbers is 3. You go to print out x, and are surprised to find its value is set to 3, even though x was never changed from 7.</p>
<p>In the above example, information was stored in an unexpected area. But the reverse can occur too, information can be retrieved from unexpected areas. Hackers attempt to do this intentionally to access secured information, and this is how the Heartbleed vulnerability occurred. However, probably the most famous corruption example in history is caused by this as well: MissingNo from Pokemon.</p>
<p>The Pokemon game ended up with extra storage for the list of Pokemon types that exist in the game. MissingNo is seen in the game by exploiting bugs that cause the game to access this data and interpret it as if it were a Pokemon. These unused Pokemon were named &quot;MissingNo&quot; but their graphical data was never set to anything.</p>
<p>In C and C++ at least, when data is not set to anything, instead of the data being cleared and set to 0, the data is whatever data was stored their previously. It's not random exactly, but it is likely to be nonsensical in the current context. Imagine if a program that sorted pictures of vegetables came across a picture of a cat. The picture of a cat isn't random, but it is meaningless to a program expecting pictures of vegetables. When the program attempts to treat it as if it is a picture of a vegetable anyway, this results in interpreting the data in a seemingly random way. We refer to this random-ish data as garbage data. Pokemon trying to interpret the garbage data as actual Pokemon sprites is what causes MissingNo type corruption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine ripping a single page out of a book. Try reading that to someone and having it make sense. Sometimes it might just get a bit garbled, or it could be on a plot twist. Maybe it's the index and now you can't find anything, or it could be a blank page that had nothing. For files they have to adhere to a specific format, so if there's a break in contiguous sections it will usually just give up and say the whole thing is unusable.</p>
<p>Code doesn't really get corrupted, well not any different than data on a disk gets corrupted. Usually it's some part of the program (like an asset or menu resource) that gets corrupted. Databases can become corrupted too where, imagine people move but nobody tells you and you send out christmas cards, but a lot bounce back and you are left confused. Database corruption can happen when it's not configured correctly and data doesn't all get updated correctly.</p>
<p>Beyond that, might need to be a bit more specific. There's a lot of ways things can get corrupted, it's a pretty broad term meaning a key piece of information is missing or nonsense because of some problem changing the data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
