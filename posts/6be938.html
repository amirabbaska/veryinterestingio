		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the sense that we usually think of it, fire does indeed need oxygen as fuel.  Oxygen obviously isn't readily available in space - so we have to be sneaky and find ways to work around the problem.  </p>
<p>The first way around the lack of atmospheric oxygen is to bring along your own oxygen supply!  Some rockets incorporate oxidizing chemicals like KNO3, others just pack a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket#Propellants" target="_blank">tank of liquid oxygen</a> along for the ride.  In a lot of cases, though, you need a spark to ignite the rocket when necessary, which can add some complication to your system.</p>
<p>In most cases, though, the answer lies in another distinction: we don't necessarily need fire to move; we need <em>thrust</em>.  </p>
<p>We can create thrust simply by ejecting mass, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrically_powered_spacecraft_propulsion" target="_blank">several</a> different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster" target="_blank">ways</a>.  However, you can usually get significantly more thrust by involving some kind of chemical reaction.  A traditional combustion reaction - fire - would be one way to do that, but there are a couple of other routes.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopropellant" target="_blank">Monopropellant</a> rockets use a chemical for their fuel which reacts when it comes into contact with something stable - a catalyst.  Chemicals like hydrazine and concentrated hydrogen peroxide can be passed over a catalyst bed (often, the catalyst is heated to improve the reaction efficiency), and the resultant decomposition of the fuel gives off energy, <em>in addition</em> to ejecting mass.  </p>
<p>Dropping back to the use of a fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source, there are also combinations of chemicals which spontaneously ignite when they come into contact which each other - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant" target="_blank">hypergolic propellants</a>.  </p>
<p>To answer your question directly, then, we don't always need to produce fire to create thrust in space, but we can do it if we need to!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all reactions require oxygen, but that's not too important. </p>
<p>Rockets often carry both the fuel and the oxidizer. This allows them to combust fuel at exactly the desired ratio (for maximum thrust, maximum efficiency, whatever), even in vacuum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is the critical difference between a turbojet engine and a rocket engine. Turbojet engines (or jet engines for short) are designed to work in the atmosphere, where oxygen levels are high enough that air can be pulled in by the intake ports or turbines, and then sent through the engine to undergo combustion with the fuel in the combustion chamber.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that you only need two parts for a combustion reaction: the fuel and the oxidizer. In most cases here on earth, the oxidizer is oxygen, but oxidizer is a general term for something that, you guessed it, oxidizes an element. So, if we dont have a readily available oxidizer, like we do in the atmosphere here on earth, we have to bring our own into space.</p>
<p>So, in a rocket fuel tank, there are actually two compartments, one for the fuel, and the other for the oxidizer. That's what allows a rocket engine to utilize combustion as a propelling mechanism for the rocket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
