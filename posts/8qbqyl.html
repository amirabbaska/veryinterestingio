		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are five types of interactions between mental illness and psychoactive substances</p>
<p>1) Predisposing : psychoactive substances alters the chemical and, if used long enough, the physical makeup of the brain. Prolonged substance abuse leads to mental illness.</p>
<p>2) Precipitating : psychoactive substances push the brain over the threshold of normalcy. There exists a biological hereditary aspect of mental disorders but if the psychological and social conditions are favourable, the individual might not develop the mental illness. Psychoactive substances are an unfavourable agent.</p>
<p>3) Perpetuating : psychoactive substances prolong the psychotic and mood symptoms of mental disorders. In these cases, the individual already has a mental disorder and the usage of psychoactive substances further worsen them.</p>
<p>4) Premedication : psychoactive substances might be used to deal with early symptoms of mental disorders. Downers are used to calm an anxious or irritable person down and uppers are used to give a boost of energy or elevate mood.</p>
<p>5) Spurious : the usage of substance has no direct effect on a mental disorder.</p>
<p>All cases of drug usage and mental disorders fall into these categories. However, which category or combination of categories is highly debatable. </p>
<p>For instance : about 20-30% of meth users develop mood or psychotic symptoms - does the drug causes mental illness? Is it used to deal with the mental illness? Does it amplify the preexisting symptoms?</p>
<p>Source: I'm a doctor in Psychiatry and currently in my masters</p>
<p>EDIT: Since so many people asked: In Malaysia, where I'm currently practicing, MD or MBBS or their equivalents are medical doctors. You work first as a houseman (US equivalent: intern) and then as a medical officer (US: Resident). You can continue working as a medical officer or open up your own GP and live happily ever after or choose to specialise in a field. In my case, I am pursuing further studies to be a specialist. I have two choices to take here - do my Masters or apply for the Royal College of Psychiatry membership. I have worked 7 years as a doctor, now stop asking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a healthy brain, there's an incredibly complex system that helps the brain manage the connections between neurons. There's always new connections being formed, old connections being destroyed, inefficient connections being streamlined, yadda-yadda, etc, all based on a system of chemical and electrical signalling that I can't possibly give an ELI5 explanation for. The takeaway point here is that the brain is always simultaneously growing and trimming these connections, and this process underlies everything from learning to memory to adaptation in general. This process is <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Many mental disorders are caused by glitches in this system which cause the brain to not &quot;wire itself up&quot; properly. Maybe the brain is cutting connections it shouldn't, or forming connections it shouldn't, or not forming them properly in the first place, or any number of other possible failure modes that all result in unusual mental functioning. If your <em>brain</em> is messed up, then your <em>mind</em> will be messed up.</p>
<p>By definition, psychoactive substances affect the brain by throwing extra chemicals into the mix. Sometimes (but not always) these chemicals can have an effect on how this wiring process happens, and trigger or accelerate the kinds of malfunctions that lead to mental illness.</p>
<p>In other words, chemically speaking, certain psychoactive substances are like throwing a wrench into the fine-tuned machine that is your brain. Some people's brains are robust enough for the wrench to not cause any permanent damage or changes; however, for other people whose brains aren't <em>quite</em> as well-balanced, the wrench can knock enough things out of whack for the brain to make problems worse on its own long after the wrench has been removed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great discussion. I have seen a lot of pro-psychedelic substance posts advocating for them as treatment of various psychological disorders. But trust me, they are a double edged sword. A scalpel can be used to cure you of cancer. But it can also fuck your shit up if used inappropriately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, those who are predisposed to certain mental disorders tend to develop symptoms earlier when exposed to stress-inducing stimuli. Ignoring whatever transient or permanent psychological changes, psychoactive substances produce intense experiences that amount to stress at least on a physiological level. This would, in part, explain why the use of a drug that is otherwise relatively harmless could cause the early onset of psychological disorders amongst certain predisposed individuals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marijuana (for instance) is more common in people who have schizophrenia than those without mental disorder. But that doesn't mean it causes or speeds up symptoms. </p>
<p>This article states there isn't a clear relationship (but young people should be cautious nonetheless). Further it mentions BDNF (Brain derived neuro-tropic factor) and how if given to mice with genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, that are also given marijuana, do not develop schizophrenia.
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317170.php" target="_blank">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317170.php</a></p>
<p>It may just be that people with mental disorders use drugs as a means to control their life or the symptoms of their disease. Many people that do not use drugs still develop mental illness. Some schizophrenics prefer to control their life with psychoactive substances, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that.</p>
<p>Last point Id like to make here is that some psychoactive substances seem to result in experiences that exhibit strange behavior. To a Doctor this would appear to be symptom of psychosis and thus mental illness. But If you are tripping balls on acid (pardon me) some people act normal, but most act fairly odd and that would make your schizophrenia seem more pronounced. With Weed many healthy people report feeling a slight paranoia, if you already have paranoid schizophrenic symptoms it could get worse. It could get better too. </p>
<p>I'm recently diagnosed with Schizo-affective disorder (which I think is BS), when I use weed I don't get paranoid or act weird, actually I feel a hell of a lot more calm and focused. Even if I truly have Schizophrenia I wouldn't give up marijuana because it helps me so much. Alcohol (not exactly a psychoactive substance) I had to give up. I was slowly, then quickly becoming an alcoholic and it affected my life terribly. The only reason I was diagnosed with Schizo-affective was because I was acting weird when I was black out drunk (don't most people act weird when black out drunk?) Anyways since I've given up the bottle I have been feeling absolutely healthy. </p>
<p>TL;DR Psychoactive substances haven't yet been proven to cause or speed up mental disorders. The drugs may just be preferred by those who have mental disorders. Then I rant about my own experience with mental illness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
