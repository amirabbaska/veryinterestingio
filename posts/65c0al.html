		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier#Internal_circuitry_of_741-type_op-amp" target="_blank">schematic for an operational amplifier</a>, you'll see that it's actually a bunch of transistors (among other things).</p>
<p>That's why they come in little <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/experiment/lab/expt6/oa.gif" target="_blank">integrated circuits</a>.</p>
<p>So to understand the inner workings of the device all the way from the fundamental motion of charge carriers, there are sort of two steps: you have to understand how transistors work on a microscopic level, and then at the circuit level you have to understand how all these transistors combine in the schematic above in order to achieve the function of an operational amplifier.</p>
<p>I'm assuming since you're asking the question, you are studying (or at least interested in studying) electronics. So are you familiar with how transistors work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OPAMPS are first of all designed based on a schematic. So at first we choose a specific circuit of either BJTs or MOSFETs that will behave the way we would want them to. In case of MOSFETs for example, we'll decide what kind of gate length and widths we need. Then depending on the performance requirements we decide if we need specific materials or other designs. Some OPAMPs are there to push the limits of what is possible and others are just supposed to be cheap.
Finally, when we know the schematic, the people of Integrated Circuit Design will figure out a layout on a chip but the layout doesn't only look at what doped regions, doping levels and transistor designs etc. They also look at whether it is possible to construct cheaply or efficiently with the production steps they have available in their factory. </p>
<p>I don't think it will be possible to provide you with an entire design of P and N regions but at the operational level, OPAMPs are designed on a lumbed element level first where the insight on their inner functioning is much more insightful then when you would try to understand it at a doping level completely. </p>
<p>If you need more information on the inner mechanics it would be easier to first know if you know how transistors work in P and N regions and if you know how an OPAMP works in a circuit schematic design. </p>
<p>Could you elaborate on your understanding on those fronts before I'll go in depth on concepts like current mirrors, current sources, differential pair gain stages, Miller capacitors etc? You might already know that. But that is unclear in  the way you phrase your question. </p>
<p>If you understand what you see in the images below (or not), we could help better. Maybe not me but others. </p>
