		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ESO announces observations of an astronomical phenomenon that has never been witnessed before. The session will take place after ESO's press conference on <strong>16 October 2017 at 16:00 CEST (10 AM ET)</strong>, which can be watched live at <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/live/" target="_blank">www.eso.org/live</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Summary</p>
<p>ESO's fleet of telescopes in Chile have detected the first visible counterpart to a gravitational wave source. These historic observations suggest that this unique object is the result of the merger of two neutron stars. The cataclysmic aftermaths of this kind of merger — long-predicted events called kilonovae — disperse heavy elements such as gold and platinum throughout the Universe. This discovery, published in several papers in the journal Nature and elsewhere, also provides the strongest evidence yet that short-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused by mergers of neutron stars.</p>
<p>Besides the science, the collaborative global effort to make this discovery possible was also very interesting. On 17 August 2017 a gravitational wave event was detected. About two seconds later, two space observatories detected a short gamma-ray burst from the same area of the sky. As night fell in Chile ESO's  telescopes as well as many others, peered at this patch of sky, pinpointing the source in visible and infrared light. Observations continued as night arrived in Hawaii, as well as for weeks after around the globe.</p>
<p>Details on the discovery can be read here: <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1733/" target="_blank">https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1733/</a></p>
<p>Guests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stephen Smartt, Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the Queen’s University Belfast. He can take questions on the electromagnetic event, kilonova, r-process, chemical enrichment, heavy elements, telescopes and surveys, finding kilonovae.</li>
<li>Joe Lyman, Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Warwick. He can take questions on the host galaxy and environment of the kilonova, as well as the observations done at ESO’s La Silla Observatory.</li>
<li>Marina Rejkuba, Associate Astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and head of ESO's User Support Department. She can take questions on ESO, telescopes, instruments, and generally the observations carried out for this event.</li>
<li>Andrew Levan, Professor of Physics at the University of Warwick. He can take questions on neutron star mergers and electromagnetic follow-up from gamma-ray to radio, observations from the facilities of the European Southern Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
<li>Paolo A. Mazzali, Professor of Astronomy, Astrophysics Research Institute, Liverpool John Moores University and Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics.</li>
<li>Avneet Singh, Doctoral researcher, Max-Planck-Institut für Gravitationsphysik (Albert-Einstein-Institut). He can answer questions on sources and searches for gravitational waves, general relativity, cosmology and physics of extreme matter.</li>
<li>Alex Nitz, Postdoctoral researcher, Max-Planck-Institut für Gravitationsphysik, Albert-Einstein-Institute. He can answer questions on the design of gravitational-wave instruments, the theory behind gravitational waves, gravitational waves from compact binary mergers, how we find signals, and measure their astrophysical parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been involved in this discovery, either operating ESO’s telescopes when the event happened or analysing the data received and drawing the conclusions. We'll be on starting at 18:30 CEST/12:30 ET. AMA!</p>
<hr />
<p>The ESO group thanks you all for the great questions. They wish to point you to the continuing discussion on reddit, specifically tomorrow, 17 October at /r/IAmA/ starting 8am PDT, 11am EDT, 5pm CET, where ~ 50 scientists of LIGO-Virgo and EM partners will be answering questions. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are there any ideas yet about why LIGO has seen a 1.1 solar mass neutron star in this binary, but we have <em>never</em> seen such a low mass neutron star before either as pulsars or in X-ray binaries? How do you make such a low mass neutron star? </p>
<p>EDIT: 1.1 is the lowest NS mass, but it looks like the distribution is not so tightly peaked as I was thinking: <a href="https://stellarcollapse.org/sites/default/files/2016-05/table_0.pdf" target="_blank">https://stellarcollapse.org/sites/default/files/2016-05/table_0.pdf</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Congrats to everyone involved!</p>
<p>On the LIGO livestream they said that VIRGO didn't detect the signal. However it actually helped them localize the source since they knew to look into VIRGO blind spots. Would a VIRGO detection actually have helped localizing the origin of the signal or made it harder? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
