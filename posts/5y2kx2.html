		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr: Yes you can double or half the temperature of something, but not in the way you're probably thinking.</strong></p>
<p>The confusing part of this topic for most people is that the temperature scales that we use in day-to-day life are kind of...arbitrary. The &quot;zero&quot; on the Fahrenheit scale was based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit#History" target="_blank">the temperature of a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride</a>, while the &quot;zero&quot; on the Celsius scale is based on the melting point of pure water. While both of these are solid reference points that anyone can measure, they really don't have any deeper physical meaning relating to the nature of temperature.</p>
<p>When we measure things, we tend to start at 0 and work up. A ruler starts at zero length no matter what units you use, a speed of zero mph or kph always means you're standing still, the pressure of outer space is zero<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/MimiZheng.shtml" target="_blank">^^(not ^^exactly)</a> whether you're using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" target="_blank">PSI</a> or <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/\(Gh\)/wwhlpr/pressure_units.rxml" target="_blank">millibars</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" target="_blank">inches</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr" target="_blank">torr</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit\)" target="_blank">atmospheres</a>, etc. But what about temperature?</p>
<p>Temperature is, in rough terms, a measure of the amount of random &quot;motion&quot; atoms and molecules have at extremely small scales. For a gas, this essentially means <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/kintem.html#c3" target="_blank">the average speed of a given molecule in the gas</a>. For solids and liquids, it roughly corresponds to the amount of &quot;jiggling&quot; the molecules do on a microscopic level. More motion/jiggling means higher temperature, less motion/jiggling means lower temperature. Many of us learned this from high school chemistry. So what would you think a proper &quot;zero&quot; for temperature would be? Naturally, you would think that &quot;zero&quot; temperature would be the temperature at which there is no motion/jiggling at all. And that's exactly what we see in physics and chemistry: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> is the temperature at which atoms would (<a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5889074/why-cant-we-get-down-to-absolute-zero" target="_blank">theoretically</a>) have no random &quot;jiggling&quot; at all.</p>
<p>So if you measure the temperature of something on a temperature scale that starts at absolute zero, then you can properly talk about &quot;doubling&quot; or &quot;halving&quot; the temperature. By far the most common scale that fits this definition is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" target="_blank">Kelvin</a> scale, which is basically the Celsius scale but it starts at absolute zero. So while absolute zero is -273.15C, on the Kelvin scale it's just 0 (and, conversely, the melting point of ice is 273.15 Kelvin).  2000K truly is twice as hot as 1000K, and 50K truly is twice as cold as 100K. Using our day-to-day scales like Fahrenheit and Celsius, this wouldn't be true: it would be like measuring things with a ruler that starts at -4 &quot;blinches&quot;, which is the same as inches but it starts at -4. We know that something that's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6QXqQzD.png" target="_blank">10 inches long</a> is twice as long as something that's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wfzDTfg.jpg" target="_blank">5 inches long</a>, but if we used our strange ruler then something that was 6 blinches long would actually be twice as long as something 1 blinch long, which really doesn't make any sense if we're just doing simple calculations!</p>
<p>Now that you have the background, we can finally get a proper answer to your question. If it was 0F today, and tomorrow it were going to be twice as hot, you might want to consider evacuating you and your loved ones, because <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0F+to+K" target="_blank">0F is 255.4K</a>, and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*255.4K" target="_blank">2×255.4K=460F</a>, which is pretty close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451" target="_blank">autoignition temperature of paper</a>. If it was 0C today, then tomorrow's doubly-hot weather will be even more unbearable: <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*273.15K" target="_blank">2×273.15K=273C</a>, which is getting close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Bulk" target="_blank">melting point of lead</a>. </p>
<p>Interestingly, if you doubled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth" target="_blank">lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth</a> (184K, which is −89.2 °C or −128.6 °F), you would get <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*184K" target="_blank">368K, which is 95 °C or 202 °F</a>, which is close to the boiling point of water, and way above the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/HottestSpot/page2.php" target="_blank">hottest natural temperature recorded anywhere on Earth</a> (outside of a volcano or a forest fire). So, in practice, it's never possible for today to be &quot;twice as hot&quot; or &quot;twice as cold&quot; as tomorrow. Unless, of course, <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/22111/temperature-of-mercury/" target="_blank">set up a homestead on Mercury</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have already been some good answers, but I'll chime in on a subtle point that I think is worth mentioning. In general, <strong>temperature is a macroscopic characteristic of large ensembles of particles</strong>. In statistical mechanics, we would call temperature an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties" target="_blank">intensive</a> variable. &quot;Temperature&quot; starts to take on a different meaning when you get down to single particles. There is certainly a relationship between the microscopic characteristics of each particle and their collective, bulk properties, but it's very incorrect to assume (except for very special cases) that all of the particles in, say, a gas at room temperature are moving at the same speed. The distribution of the microscopic characteristics like energy and speed can be found with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution</a>, which is an incredibly important piece of math in all statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the speed of a particle is not linear with its kinetic energy. You may have seen the expression for kinetic energy before, KE=(1/2)<em>m</em>v^2. You'll notice that the energy scales with the velocity squared. So, if you double the energy (and kept m the same), you've only doubled v^2, so increased v by the square root of 2. It also becomes more complicated because there are many ways for energy to &quot;hide&quot; in the system that aren't related to the translational speed of the particle. </p>
<p>As other people have pointed out, &quot;zero&quot; temperature really only has objective meaning if you're talking about absolute zero, which is 0 Kelvin,  about -273 Celsius, and about -460 Fahrenheit. However, even if you made up your own thermometer with its own scale, there would be a lowest possible temperature that would correspond to the same &quot;absolute zero&quot;. From a microscopic perspective, the bulk property of absolute zero temperature is due to every single particle in a system being in its ground state, or its lowest possible energy. Again, it's an unusual case because every single particle has the same energy.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question directly, particles at 80 C do not move twice as fast as particles at 40 C. On average, they are moving faster, but it's much less than twice. At out roughest approximation, we can simply let velocity increase go with the ratio of square root of temperature, so moving from 40 C to 80 C, and converting to Kelvin, we have sqrt(353)/sqrt(313) = 1.06. So, <strong>they're moving about 6% faster on average</strong>. Again, this is a very rough approximation, the real story is much more complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the other question (do molecules go twice as fast) the answer is no, they go sqrt(2) times as fast. This is because changes in temperature depend on changes in energy, and the energy of a moving particle is (1/2)mv^(2). <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/kintem.html" target="_blank">Explanatory hyperphysics page</a></p>
<p>Note that this applies to ideal gases, not so much liquids or solids because of quantum mechanics reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say when you say &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;, it's with respect to the ideal temperature, maybe around 72F.</p>
<p>So yes, twice as cold as 0F would be around -72F</p>
<p>Related to your original question would perhaps be saying something's twice as hot as 72F; for which the same method would yield ... 72F. Which does makes sense - because 72F is not hot, nor is it cold; so twice as hot as not-hot or not-cold should also yield ... not-hot or not-cold.</p>
<p>And yes, this would also apply to temperature in terms of molecular energy; but comparing to molecular energy at comfy room temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a physics point of view, degrees C is absurd (although F is worse). So yeah there isn't a meaningful way to interpret &quot;twice as warm&quot; in C. As people have observed, you can convert to kelvin, but that get you answers like &quot;twice as hot as 0C is ~250C&quot; which doesn't really answer the question your colleagues are asking.</p>
<p>To answer that question (or approach an answer), consider this. Can humans really feel temperature? If you take two blocks, one rubber and one metal, and leave them for a while, which feels colder? You know they are both the same temperature but the metal feels colder. Ok now if I put some ice on each block, which ice melts faster? You want to say the rubber, because it felt warmer, but the truth is it's the one on the metal block. The reason is that metal is a better conductor, and it's the same reason the metal feels colder: we don't really feel temperature, we feel the rate of change of temperature on our skin and use that as a proxy.</p>
<p>So the question you really want to ask might be: at what temperature does the rate of change double?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
