		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are very specific FCC rules about language and adult content on <em>broadcast</em> television. The FCC regulates such content on radio and television broadcasts.</p>
<p>However, the FCC doesn't have that same regulatory authority over cable/satellite transmissions. So, if it's a channel that isn't broadcast, but only available through a satellite or cable provider, then it's really up to the channel itself what kind of language and content they have.</p>
<p>The distinction is the same on radio -- satellite radio can have content that terrestrial radio would never be permitted to air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radio and Network television goes out over public airways for which there are stricter rules about content from the FCC.  Cable TV doesn't have such restrictions, since it's a private network.  They are accountable to their advertisers, so they are somewhat restrained.  Subscription channels aren't restricted by the FCC or advertisers, so they typically have the least restrictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FCC governs broadcasts. That is Radio and the base TV channels that can be picked up with an antenna. The are transmitted on public airwaves which are owned by the US population as a whole and leased out to specific stations to transmit on. </p>
<p>Cable and Satellite however do not use publicly owned resources. They use privately run cables, and private satellites. This means that the FCC has almost no regulatory power over them, them are private entities using their property. Some channels self regulate in order to appeal to specific audiences and specific advertisers, but they can all technically cuss, show violence, or nudity if they want. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Broadcast tv is regulated, but not satellite/cable. Antenna radio is regulated, satellite radio is not.</p>
<p>It comes down to &quot;oh, anyone can stumble upon it if it's free and you don't really do anything special to get it, but if you're paying for it, it's up to you to control your exposure or that of your little ones.&quot; </p>
<p>That's pretty ELI5, I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Broadcast is at the mercy of the law. Cable sort of self-governs to make itself more appealing to advertisers. They are not bound to regulations like broadcast tv is. Same with terrestrial and satellite radio</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
