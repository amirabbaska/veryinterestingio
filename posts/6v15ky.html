<p>Is there some guidelines of some sort that I can follow to safely take photos with my smartphone WITHOUT a filter? Everywhere has been sold out so I find it ridiculous that there's no true way to actually witness the eclipse or photograph it without special equipment when I can take normal pictures of the normal sun perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Is it just &quot;don't zoom in 100% on the sun and only the sun while it's happening&quot; or is there some special phenomenon that occurs during an eclipse that makes it more dangerous?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is not your phones camera, but the risk of you looking at the eclipse for too long, looking directly at the sun during the day by itself is already a bad idea.  </p>
<p>The danger during an eclipse is your eyes adjusting for a dark environment, so your pupils widen, if you now look at the eclipse your eyes might take severe damage, without you even noticing, as the brightness of the sun that would usually force you to look away/close your eyes isn't there anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly dude, eclipse totality is going to look exactly the same as it has for 1,000s of years. why people would be pointing at the sun and taking a photograph with their mediocre phone camera instead of looking around and enjoying a rare experience is beyond my comprehension.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll chime in. I'm professional photographer. I haven't shot an eclipse, but I have shot with a 90mm Reflector Telescope.</p>
<p>The issue with shooting the sun is the lens. The front element captures all available light, and through a series of elements focuses that light onto the sensor. You're right in saying you can take photos of the sun without damaging your camera. An eclipse doesn't suddenly produce more light. The sensor will protect itself from excess light. But like burning ants with a magnifying glass, enough focused light will physically burn the sensor. So I wouldn't set the camera on a tripod and do a long exposure shot. It'll have enough time for the infa-red to burn the sensor.</p>
<p>The other issue is burning out your retinas. Some professional cameras have an optical viewfinder. The light comes down the lens and there is a mirror in front of the sensor that directs the image up into the viewfinder. When you press the shutter release it flips and directs the image at the sensor. Then back to the viewfinder. </p>
<p>So just like the sensor, that concentrated light is directed at your retina. Magnifying glass vs ant again. This is that same reason that every telescope has stickers everywhere that says &quot;don't look at sun&quot;.</p>
<p>The only time I worked on a job where a sensor was fired was a big stage performance and a lazar shot directly into a digital cinema camera. It's pretty rare.</p>
<p>As you smart phone doesn't have a large lens to direct the light, or an optical viewfinder, I wouldn't worry too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought the advice was given because shooting a picture of the sun will end up looking crappy. Have you ever tried taking a picture of the moon? It ends up being a tiny white dot on a black background with maybe an ugly halo. You need more professional equipment to be able to get a decent picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
