		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the reason the temperature in the past was so much higher is that the high CO2 levels persisted for many thousands of years allowing for the progressive accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere which accelerated the greenhouse effect. CO2 is actually the second most important greenhouse gas behind water vapor, though it is often the trigger for climatic change because it's concentration in the atmosphere is controlled by a variety of complex processes where as water vapor is effectively controlled by temperature and pressure. Over time the increased temperature has a positive feedback with water in the atmosphere allowing for very elevated temperatures. It's worth noting that when we say the &quot;the last time&quot; we are taking a snapshot of a world that had been experiencing those conditions for millenia.</p>
<p>We currently believe we can keep the warming around 2C because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. In the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of the concern about methane stems from the potential positive feedback loop that exists in polar regions. There's a ton of methane locked up in the 10's of millions of square kilometres of polar permafrost regions, and if these regions melt under climate change this adds to methane emissions, which adds to GHG emissions, which leads to more warming, which leads to more permafrost melting, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. First, a little background. So the last time atmospheric CO2 levels were as high as they are today (~ 408 ppm) was about 15 mya (some say more, some say less). Regardless of the exact date, Earth's climate system was considerably different back then than it is today, and so were all of its components - climactic feedback mechanisms, ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns, vegetation coverage, ozone levels, ice cover, concentrations of other GHGs, etc. All of these components contribute (either directly or indirectly) to global temperature. Therefore, although it is important to understand paleotemperature fluctuations and the climactic factors that caused them, comparing our current climactic situation with the past in regards to CO2 concentrations alone isn't necessarily relevant to your question; you have to consider current state of all the system's components. Scientists believe (with high confidence) that the temperature change resulting from GHG emissions can be kept to less than 2Â°C relative to pre-industrial levels IF atmospheric concentrations do not exceed 450 ppm CO2eq by 2100. These numbers take into account all the knowledge we have about the current state of the Earth's climate system's components. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I've not seen mentioned so far is the importance of the oceans in regulating temperature and CO2. </p>
<p>The oceans are one of the most important components of the carbon cycle since they interact with the atmosphere and can store large amounts of carbon at great depths where it doesn't influence planetary temperature. </p>
<p>Our oceans are also vital in terms of temperature regulation. Alongside the atmosphere, the oceans redistribute heat from the equator to higher latitudes. At these high latitudes waters become cold and dense and so they sink, forming what we call deep waters. The 'ocean conveyor belt' (or meridional overturning circulation) is really important in maintaining a climate that is in equilibrium. If we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today then in a very simplistic model we might expect that over a few thousands years deep water would carry a large amount of carbon dioxide down into the deep ocean and atmospheric CO2 would reduce to pre-indutrial levels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the formation of deep water is reduced, via factors like less dense waters in the North Atlantic (as Greenland melts) and changed in wind patterns in the Southern Ocean, then it means less carbon can be taken from the atmosphere in the long term and temperatures could increase dramatically. Right now we think there were times in the past where overall deepwater formation was slow and that is associated with periods of long-term warm temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well we pretty much can't. The best estimates show that there is less than 5% chance of us keeping the warming to below 2C variance. There is still a slight chance, but because there are so many people who aren't bothered by it, we will not be able to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
