		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a school psychologist, so I giving kids IQ tests is actually a big part of my job.</p>
<p>Every test is a little bit different, but the ones worth their salt are typically based on CHC theory, which divides intelligence into different broad and narrow bands, and then uses different subtests to measure those. So, the gold standard in most parts of the country right now are the Weschler Tests of cognitive ability. There is one for preschoolers, school aged kids, and adults. </p>
<p>For the most part, the test is divided into ten subtests, with the option to do more if needed. They subtests range from answering vocabulary (measuring crystallized knowledge and long term retrieval skills) to recreating 2-d images with 3-d blocks (visual processing abilities, fluid reasoning skills). When scored, there are five subtests that correspond to the broad bands of intelligence based on CHC theory, and then the full scale IQ which is generally considered he best estimate of overall cognitive abilities and typically corresponds to spearman's g, which is another intelligence theory where g is general intelligence.</p>
<p>All of these tests are normed on a huge sample that has been stratified to resemble the population that it's measuring. So, in the US, the school aged test, is given to thousands of kids ages 6-17, races, economic levels, with differing parental education levels, handicaps and disabilities, etc. Based on all of that information, the scores are put on a bell curve so that dead average is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Within that, the test is normed for different age groups- so a kid that is 7 years and 3 months old could get all of the exact same answers right and wrong as a kid who is 10 years 7 months, and the 7 year old will have significantly higher IQ than the 10 year old because the test is normed based on age group.</p>
<p>No matter the test, it is always true that if you score 100, you will have done better than half the population. If you score a 70 you performed better than 2 percent of the population, and if you scored 130 you did better than 98 percent. </p>
<p>There are other types of IQ tests that don't correspond to the theories mentioned. Oftentimes they're for a specific population. For example, there are nonverbal tests for those who don't speak the language or are severely autistic. Those tests can't measure crystallized knowledge (the knowledge we learn and retain based on exposure... historical facts, vocabulary, etc), so they rely much more heavily on fluid reasoning abilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My training is mainly from the use of cognitive assessments (IQ tests) for schools, but there always seems to be such controversy and misinformation about their use and interpretation I hope to lend some of my knowledge. </p>
<p>A good IQ test, defined by what I would use in practice and trust it's validity, reliability, psychometrics, etc., should be individually administered and standardized. These group IQ assessments that I see some people are given in the comments do not fit what I would use. In my opinion, those should not be considered IQ test, they seem more like academic assessments, but I'd need to know more. </p>
<p>As for the test supervisor, these people can be from a variety of professions as long as they have training in how to administer that specific test. My profession and training mainly addressed psychologists, but it may differ where you live, etc.</p>
<p>Standardized means that the test would have been given to thousands of kids (again my training is in schools) of different ages (broken down by year and month) to get the scores that the test maker applies fancy statistics and the normal bell curve to standardize the scores, which we can then present as an IQ score.</p>
<p>The test maker applies the bell curve because they expect an average amount of intelligent behavior in the general population. This would mean there are people who scored in the &quot;tails&quot; of the bell curve who are much higher than the majority of the kids tested and much lower. Since the test maker have made a test, they usually base it on previous tests and new research.  They also have to update them to the new population every few years due to outdated material, inefficient material, and the Flynn Effect (there's a good TED talk to look up on this).</p>
<p>Intelligent behavior can be measured many different ways and as previous commenters pointed out, it can be different within cultures. There are many different cognitive assessments. Some attempt to remove language from the assessment where directions are given non verbally. Some are intensive neuropsychological batteries that require a lot of little tasks. </p>
<p>I think that's where the controversy comes from with cognitive assessment. As part of a comprehensive assessment, I would administer much more than just an IQ test to help understand a child's functioning. For example, a child who has difficulty with language or severe anxiety will not perform as well on the assessment. We were trained to spot that by using other assessments and informal data. </p>
<p>We don't use IQ as some sort gate to a child's future. However, as many studies have shown there is a correlation with IQ and academic performance. Probably because a lot of the tasks can be generalized to tasks or concepts we are trying to teach in schools. If you want to debate what is intelligent behavior, please go ahead. It's a contentious topic even within our own community. But IQ assessments aren't inherently evil or used nefariously in my profession. We use them to try and help kids get an adequate education and use strategies and interventions that are best tuned to their many abilities. </p>
<p>I'm sorry for any errors or strangely worded sentences, I'm on my phone. The comment section will probably get pretty divided and ugly if the past serves as an example. I would be happy to answer any questions people have/ elaborate further on topics. I do like what I do ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically any iq test can make up its own rules regarding scoring on questions. Then afterwards you map all results, and make it so the average person scores 100</p>
<p>Proper tests generally have a test taker that will make sure you do everything correctly, and determine if your answer is correct, or partially correct. (Though most test questions are logical, so they only have right or wrong answers.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, and that holds true for all good psychological tests, there is an inital large pool of questions/puzzles. An initial sample of people works through these. The assumption, of course, is that one factor, intelligence, explains most of your performance on those items. In other words, your final &quot;IQ score&quot; should correlate highly with the performance on individual items. That is, if you are highly intelligent, you are more likely to solve this problem and vice versa.</p>
<p>However, there might be items that do not actually test for intelligence (maybe they just test creativity or mere knowledge). Performance on these items should not correlate highly with intelligence. Moreover, performance on these items should not correlate highly with performance on other items that test intelligence.</p>
<p>It's like in school: An intelligent kid will have good grades in math, physics, chemistry, english, etc. We can say that these are correlated. However, the grade in physical education (and music or arts) does not correlate highly with those grades because they are dominated by a different factor, physical fitness.</p>
<p>You can analyze the performance for all items with a so-called factor analysis. Ideally, this analysis should yield one factor that explains most of the performance. We can label this factor &quot;intelligence&quot;. Items that &quot;do not load highly&quot; on this factor (i.e. correlate with it) should be eliminated from the test. In the end, you should have a test, with one dominating factor.</p>
<p>Performance in this revised test should correlate with performance in another, already estabilshed IQ test (there are, in fact, several different IQ tests in use). Of course, if both tests test the same thing, you should have similar scores in them. In addition, the IQ score&quot; should correlate with things that we generally assume are correlated with intelligence. Often, this is school performance. In fact, early IQ tests were designed to predict school performance (to identify children who need support).</p>
<p>Using another large sample, you can determine the mean performance. Assuming that intelligence is affected by multiple factors, it will be normal distributed. That is, most people have an average intelligence, few have such a combination of factors that leads to a very high or very low intelligence. Under this assumption you can set mean performance in the sample as &quot;IQ 100&quot; and use the variance in the sample to determine which score is how far away from the mean with respect to the population. That is, with an IQ of 130 you will be two standard deviations away from the mean, meaning that about 2 percent of the population have a higher IQ than you.</p>
<p>There are, however, several things to consider. For instance, most IQ tests (if not all) do not assume or find just one factor. Often there is a distinction between mathematical intelligence and verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, etc. Although these usually correlate to some extent, this correlation is not too high. Therefore talking about just one IQ score is not telling the whole story. Moreover, an IQ test is not there to push your self-esteem, it is a scientific and diagnostic instrument with a specific purpose. IQ tests are, for instance, needed to determine whether certain circumstances (environment, background, interventions, etc.) actually have consequences on this general factor &quot;intelligence&quot;. There are needed to make groups in experiments comparable. They are used to identify specific deficits. If you have normal intelligence but a low score in reading comprehension, you might have dyslexia. In contrast to low reading comprehension and low intelligence. Both cases need to treated differently.
Finally, an intelligence score is always defined in relation to the population from which the initial sample was drawn. Since intelligence - or rather, performance on intelligence tests - increased over the decades, an IQ score in a non-updated test from the 60's isn't your actual IQ, because it does not relate to the current population. And you being &quot;smarter than 98% of the population&quot; is nothing to brag about if you are constantly surrounded by the remaining 2%.</p>
<p>Concerning &quot;half correct answers&quot;. It is harder to construct and validate IQ tests with these. There are different flavors of IQ tests and as far as I can recall there are tests that have that - however, the widely used tests usually don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Because of this, they are good at testing a person's capacity for pattern recognition and derivation of a pattern set before them.  The harder the question, the harder to derive the pattern.</p>
<p>At the end, the average score is marked at 100, and the highers are above while the lowers are below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
