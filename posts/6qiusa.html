		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is mentioning uniforms, but that's incorrect. Having any form of uniform wasn't very common for a lot of histoey. Standing armies night have a mandated uniform and armor, and later on livery became common (even then, not everyone had one), but for most of history you bought your own armor and wore your own clothes. There was no uniform. Of course by medival times, on which game of thrones is based, livery was common. And it does show up in game of thrones with, for example, the very distinctive Lannister army gear. However, the fact that armies have only had uniforms or livery for a relatively short time but managed not to kill their own men even before that suggests that isn't the explanation. </p>
<p>Instead, the problem is that game of thrones is really bad at depicting battles. Very little warfare in history involved skirmishes where everyone got into a giant mess and people paired off and fought their duels, with everyone else fighting around them. It looks awesome on tv, but it almost never happened. For starters, most warfare was seiges and maneuvers. You sit outside a town or castle until the people inside starve, or you lead a giant army and yell &quot;you better watch out or we're gonna attack&quot; and breathe a sigh of relief when the other guys slink away. </p>
<p>When a battle did happen, it looked very different from battles on GoT. You didn't pair up and fight other people. Instead, your army forms a few lines, their army forms a few lines, and the two groups stand across from other and try to kill the other side while doing their best to not die. Some units might move around, cavalry might charge, arrows would be shot, but it almost never happened that the formation broke up and the battle broke down into a bunch of duels (if the formation did break, it's because someone was running <em>away</em> from the fighting). You fought the entire battle surrounded by your own men, which made it really easy to know who to kill. You kill the guys opposite you - the ones poking a spear in your face - and you don't kill the guy behind you. </p>
<p>Now, skirmishes did happen of course. A unit might get isolated from their army, a small part of the formation might break down, a travelling group might get ambushed, a ship might be boarded, etc. But they were between small groups, not entire armies. You would know everyone on your side because you've been travelling and fighting with them.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uniforms were very important. Even when there is no money to make proper uniforms there is some way of identification they found. This is actually how the German flag got its colors. Some time in the past they had a war coming but couldn't afford to get everyone a proper uniform so they ordered them to dye their clothes black (which is a very easy color do dye) and handed out red pockets and some (goldish coloured) buttons. They were then easy to identify and the modern flag got it's colors from it. I am sure other countries/tribes etc found similar ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thats what uniforms, flags/banners and sigils on shields are there for. One guy in your squad normally knows who is who and who is allied to you. </p>
<p>In GoT, we see Bran learning sigils of Houses and Tyrion testing Pod on the Dornish banners. It is very important important knowledge for commanders.</p>
<p>Also, battles were rarely as chaotic as the Battle of the Bastards. Most battles were in formation and relatively orderly. You normally knew the people left and right of you because those were the guys with whom you marched and sat around the fire. And when you know the people to the left, to the right, and behind you, and somebody runs to you from the front screaming and raising a sword, it's easy to find out who is friend or foe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
