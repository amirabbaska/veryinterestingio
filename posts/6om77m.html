No matter how much energy you put into accelerating the rod, the most outer part would still move at some subluminal speed. As you put more and more energy into the system the outer part rotates closer and closer at the speed of light but it never can reach it.</p>
<p>Mind that a rod can also never be perfectly rigid as a solid consists out of atoms that interact with each other at the speed of light. If you do something with one end of the rod it can only affect the other end after a delay equal to the distance of the two points divided by the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The theoretical constraint on how strong a material can be is (surprise) a function of the speed of light. Since the force holding atoms together propagates at the speed of light you can very easily see that no matter what material you use, the rod MUST break before the end accelerates to the speed of light. If the rod doesn't break, then the material itself violates all of the rules of physics and it doesn't make any sense to describe what is happening at the tip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought I would mention the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagnac_effect" target="_blank">Sagnac</a> effect here, if you had a disk spinning so that the edge was at the speed of light, then to any observer there would have to be strange effects. </p>
<p>Assuming a clockwise spin: </p>
<p>Nothing could move in the clockwise direction at all. This includes movements of the atoms making up the disk.  The edge of the disk would therefore appear to be a singularity to a stationary observer.</p>
<p>An observer on the disk would be unable to travel clockwise, while anticlockwise movement would take you around the full circumference of the disk instantaneously.</p>
<p>I do not think it is possible to interpret this in any meaningful way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have a straight rod at t=0. You apply a torque at the middle of the rod. In a rigid body, the rod would start to rotate according to the moment of inertia as t = ia. </p>
<p>But since rigid body only works in certain assumptions, like not being a significant fraction of the speed of light, instead of the rod rotating according to the total moment of inertia, the torque instead propagates out from the center to the ends at the speed of sound in whatever material you pick. </p>
<p>So at t=0.01 or something, you have a rod that is slightly twisted (with the distance d1 from the torque equal to v*.01, where v is the speed of sound of the material). At t=.02, the center is now twisted a little more and the distances from the torque to the new extent of the action being d2, the part of the rod from d1 to d2 will be less rotated than d0 to d1. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>If you carry this out you realize that your rod actually behaves a little like a spaghetti noodle floating in water. You twist the center, and the outside takes a while to catch up. Eventually you wrap it up in a spiral around the torque point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The force travels through the rod from the point of rotation to the extremities at &quot;the speed of sound through the rod's material&quot; (subluminal).</p>
<p>Energy is lost as the rod flexes while rotating. Pouring more energy into the rotation results in more flexing and heat as you attempt to approach C. Ultimately the rod will break, as the upper limit on material strength in our universe is a function of C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
