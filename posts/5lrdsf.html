		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In music production lingo, what you're looking for would be called a dynamic range compressor. They're used a lot with popular music to make it sound brighter, crisper, and louder, as well as to make it easier to hear over the din of an automobile or a bar. Dynamic range compression is an unpopular technique with audiophiles since its overuse can take away from the impact and fidelity of a piece of music, and even cause unwanted distortion in extreme cases.</p>
<p>I've often wondered why consumer audio systems don't just come with compressors built in, so the users can dial in the amount of compression they want. Personally, I'd end up using it a lot  more for movies and television than for music. It is a feature some audio systems have, but my best guess as to why they aren't standard is due to cost reasons, and because the general public doesn't know what it is. Another theory is that the music industry doesn't want people owning their own compressors, so that they can continue waging the loudness war and finding new ways to make their music stand out on the radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of media player softwares have a feature called &quot;volume normalization&quot; which tries to make all of the audio played in a media file near the same volume. It's been around a long time, but for some reason you don't see it often on TV's or stereo receivers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A HUGE part of this is inadequate (or non-) mix down from 5.1 Surround to Stereo.</p>
<p>A typical result is, dialogue is <em>very quiet.</em>  Then, music or effects BLOW YOUR GODDAMN WALLS OUT.</p>
<p>Since most of TV is programmed in Surround, this is not always super easy to fix.  </p>
<p>Some TV do have a master mix down to Stereo function.  But if not... you have to do it outboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This already exists :</p>
<p>It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression" target="_blank">Dynamic range compression</a></p>
<p>If you have a home theater receiver, this may be called different things such as &quot;Midnight mode&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Range Compensation&quot;, or &quot;Adaptive Range Control&quot; or other buzz phrases. But it's all the same thing. </p>
<p>(It makes the loud parts quiet, and the quiet parts loud)</p>
<p>EDIT: To answer your second question, it's usually a feature on most receivers, but not all of them. It is also usually disabled by default because people usually want the loud/quiet experience which is true to the source material, and not the compressed experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
