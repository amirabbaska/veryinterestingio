		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Med student here. Lots of pseudoscience around here that's actually semi-accurate. The pediatric inhibitory nervous system is relatively underdeveloped. Kids are twitchy, uncoordinated, and pukey because of this. They don't have good inhibitory nerves tamping down on things, so thresholds for most actions, puking included, are lower. They also have a shorter distance from stomach to mouth. Heartburn for you is vomit for a kid. </p>
<p>Edit: This is simplified, as there are other factors at play beyond simply a proportionate decrease in distance that needs to be traveled. See below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When children are ill they don't really dwell on having to vomit so they are more likely to relax their stomach and oesophagus (food pipe) muscle allowing nausea to easily turn into vomiting. Under the age of two, toddlers and babies are usually lying down so their stomach and oesophagus muscle are weak and thus it's really easy for the food from the stomach to just exit upwards through the oesophagus and out their mouth. Babies already do this on a regular basis during breastfeeding or bottle feedings. </p>
<p>For adults, not only are our muscles stronger but our mind is stronger too. We will be the ones responsible for cleaning up our own vomit, we know how disgusting our mouths will taste and how the pain in our abdomen from vomiting will just add to our overall malaise. Children don't have to worry about much because most likely their parents will take care of them. (HOPEFULLY!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
