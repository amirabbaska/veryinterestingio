		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>The first has already been covered: Voltage.</p>
<p>The second is more subtle. Zinc Chloride, Zinc-Carbon and Alkaline cells all have a substantial internal resistance and quite a poor current capability. This protects against shorts and can be used by simply designed toys to limit current.</p>
<p>NiCd and NiMH have virtually no internal resistance, so if the toy was relying on the battery to limit its current, it would draw dramatically more current than it was expecting, often involving physics, such as heat, light, fire and motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of responses have talked about lower voltage, but let me just expand a little about internal resistance. Alkaline and older 'heavy duty' dry cells have this, and rechargeables generally don't This is a tough property to explain, but basically the battery itself acts as a limiter to how much current (amps) it can send out. If you start trying to draw too much power from the battery, the battery's own resistance will start to warm the battery up, further sapping power. This would eventually hit an equilibrium not allowing any more power to flow. A sort of internal limiter. As /u/Hattix has already said, this can be used on basic devices to stop them pulling more than a safe amount of power. </p>
<p>Rechargeables don't have such limits, so can over-power a cheap device that's expecting that internal limitation to kick in. </p>
<p><a href="https://image.dhgate.com/albu_214338001_00/1.0x0.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> type of basic LED torch can have this problem. I had one and managed to kill it with rechargeables. </p>
<p>LEDs need a limit to their power - if you connect them to an sufficient power source they'll just keeping pulling more and more current until they cook themselves, you have to limit it. In a decent torch that would be done by adding a <a href="https://media.rs-online.com/t_large/R0132494-01.jpg" target="_blank">resistor</a> in line with the LED. The resistor resists the flow of current, and keeps the LED in check; stops it pulling too much power and killing itself prematurely. </p>
<p>But resistors cost money. In the cheapest torches then, you just forget the resistor and depend on the internal resistance of the non-rechargeable batteries you've put in it to hold back the power and give the LEDs long life. Sure it's not ideal, but it'll work in a pinch. </p>
<p>Put rechargeable batteries, which have no internal resistance in such a torch, which has no built in resistors, and the LED's will just keep sucking power until they go pop, which they will in pretty short order. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons may have been the low voltage everyone is talking about, but in the 90's and 00's NiMH phased out NiCd and those are pretty close to the 1.5V of alkaline batteries</p>
<p>Another important is that rechargeable batteries need to be monitored when they are discharged as to stop what's called deep discharging. You need to monitor the voltage level and if it drops below a certain point you stop the device. If you discharge the battery below that point you ruin it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
