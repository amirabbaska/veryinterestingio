		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound of a person's voice is determined by a number of different factors, and these factors vary person to person. </p>
<p>First, the vocal folds (aka vocal chords) vibrate when a person speaks certain sound and in doing so produce a fundamental frequency that we perceive as the underlying pitch in a person's voice. This frequency varies based on anatomical differences such as the overall length of the folds and their thickness, but also based on their current status such as how stretched out they are at a given point in time.</p>
<p>Second, a lot of how a person's voice sounds depends on resonance, the acoustic result of sound waves bouncing around in a person's throat, mouth, and nasal cavity. Since each person's throat, mouth, and nasal cavity are unique, this means that the sound waves will bounce around differently in these spaces for every person on the planet. It also means that even if two people are producing the same fundamental frequency, they will not end up with a voice that sounds the exact same.</p>
<p>Third, speaking patterns are different person to person, and also affect how we perceive someone's voice.  What I'm referring to here are what are called suprasegmentals: things like intonation, rate, emphasis patterns, etc. These are complex factors that are a result of things such as what language a person speaks and who modeled language for them as they developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that we have a lot of neurons/brain structures dedicated to hearing the differences between different peoples voices and remembering them. Language and social relationships are obviously a big part of human's evolutionary success and being able to recognize people by their voice is probably a big help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
