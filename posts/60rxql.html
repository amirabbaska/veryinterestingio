		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe one of the most significant factors was that aristocratic women tended not to breast feed their children, they had a wet nurse on staff to breast feed the babies. The noble breast sort of isn't seen it isn't displayed it doesn't have utility.  Its kept in sort of mint condition.  So you have this sort of class-based thing going on where among the ruling class the breasts are sort of <em>special</em> they're set aside and flopping breasts around and feeding babies with them is for the poor people.  </p>
<p>What happens later on is that you get the middle class rising up the wealthy business people who start getting more and more political power and they all wanted to absorb all the sort of cultural weight of the nobility.  The middle class was getting money and power but they wanted that respectability and esteem of the upper class.  So they really pushed the veneration of the breast even further. It wasn't any longer just about noble women not wanting the inconvenience of constantly having to feed a baby with their breasts and having milk stains on them, it was something of status. And once it becomes something that has status it effectively becomes seductive.  Like fancy cars have a seductive element to them people swoon over them.  It becomes something that's powerfully desirable for reasons not really related to its exact purpose.  And thus essentially transforms into a fetish, the original meaning of the word fetish is an object that is associated with some special power, like a statue or doll that is considered magical. The sexual fetish is giving specifically seductive power to a thing which doesn't have an innately seductive or sexual nature.  </p>
<p>Eventually when baby formula was invented to replace breastfeeding then every woman's breast could essentially become a sacred thing to be kept in mint condition.  So in the 20th century breast fetishism could really take off.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cultures in which breast are not sexualized are ones that are nude or near nude much of the time. </p>
<p>Europe and Asia have long histories of being clothed, often in complex clothing. This increases the base modesty level of the society. The modesty of society is then increased further by religious and societal customs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Even it easly to spot a mature women sitting in front of her house or walk around in his house topless. And kids see it as normal things
But as these countries are in development progress many young girls, women who live in cities  keep theirs breastes clothed even at home. Not in public only.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
