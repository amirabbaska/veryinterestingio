		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the rural area where I live, the well water has a fairly high fluoride content.  Because it is a little bit higher than the recommended dose, and certainly more than added fluoride content in city water supplies, our local health unit has recommended that children in our community do not use toothpaste with fluoride, to prevent fluorosis. It is likely that fluoride free toothpaste is intended for communities like ours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fluoride-free toothpaste exists for the same reason gluten-free products exist. </p>
<p>Some people have an intolerance to fluoride that can present itself in mouth ulcers. Not uncommon, it seems to run in my family and I'm aware of a couple of friends that have the same issues. Not a big deal, doesn't cause any major harm, just uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Because some people need it, the product pops up in the market. People see it and either assume it has health benefits or has read something somewhere that says it's bad for you. So the market for it increases and major brands pick it up to increase sales. </p>
<p>Simple as that really. If you can use fluoride toothpaste then you probably should. I hear it's better for you. But if you have frequent mouth ulcers then try brushing with fluoride-free toothpaste and see if it makes a difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scientific reason: Some people have a negative reaction to toothpaste containing fluoride. This can be white stripes on the teeth, mouth ulcers, or inflammation due to an allergy.</p>
<p>The social reason: Some people think the government makes us consume fluoride in toothpaste and water to make the general population easier to manipulate and control. The argument behind this idea varies but what I've seen most is that Hitler added fluoride to German water right before the war supposedly to control the population. Therefore fluoride bad because Hitler's used it. </p>
<p>I use toothpaste with fluoride because it works for me and I don't subscribe the theory that it is used to control he population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They say fluoride is bad in large quantities.  And it is.  But there are not large quantities in toothpaste.  Small quantities can help strengthen your teeth without negative effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
