		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotionally healthy people emote with their eyes. When they smile, the outer corners of their eyes tend to wrinkle. They raise their eyebrows when they're happy to see you. They look around to see the world and to observe others. Their eyes, in other words, are &quot;alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Depressed people either don't feel these things, or spend so much time not feeling them that they lose touch with how they'd usually express them. A depressed person will smile with their mouth, but not their eyes. They won't move their gaze around to see the whole picture - they don't care. They basically use their eyes strictly as a tool to grab certain information and not trip over things. They might not even be paying attention with their eyes, or with any of their senses. They might point their eyes at you just so you'll think they're fine. In other words, their eyes are &quot;dead.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised no one's mentioned pupil dilation. The &quot;thousand mile stare&quot; is mostly unfocused eyes with the pupils dilated.  The lids also stay in a neutral position. It looks like &quot;giving up&quot; because our brains can recognize there's no effort being expended by the eyes.</p>
<p>A normal &quot;happy&quot; expression involves a very slight narrowing of the eyelids and the pupils narrowed to a near focus.</p>
<p>&quot;Dead eyes&quot; and &quot;twinkling eyes&quot; aren't so much expressions as micro expressions- the language is just our way to articulate recognition of changes that are so subtle that they've been borderline subconscious until very recently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That twinkle comes from natural lubricant on the eye's surface. When eyes connect exactly with someone else's, they reflect light back and forth creating a sparkle/reflective effect. When people are happy they have a greater likelihood of making more eye contact, depressed people tend to avoid it and thus no sparkle while tired and worn out eyes will be less lubricated and other signs of fatigue such as redness or dark circles will offset the twinkle too. Additionally, when you smile, you squint, increasing the depth of the lubricant, by reducing the surface area of the eyeball with your eyelids increasing the amount of sparkle on the eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any literal twinkle/sparkle must come from reflected light. In most situations, lighting cones from above. In order for you to see a reflection of that light on someone's eyes, you have to see a portion of their eye that is on an angle somewhere between the angle facing the light and the angle facing your eyes. Depressed people tend to look downwards more than up, and tend to have their eyes less than fully open/half lidded. On average, the angles that would show a reflected light are covered by their eyelids or shadowed due to their downcast gaze.</p>
<p>Add this to the general lack of energy and emotion in their eyes and you get the dead eyed effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
