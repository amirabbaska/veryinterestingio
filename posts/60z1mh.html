What is the process that is happening and why is this heated solution able to freeze over?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. This is a crystallization from a supersaturated solution. </p>
<p>How this works... a liquid can dissolve different amounts of material depending on the temperature. By boiling the water, you are able to increase the water's ability to dissolve material. What is happening in the gif is the water is brought to a boil and the maximum amount of material (in this case sodium acetate) is dissolved. This hot solution of water and sodium acetate is transferred to the glass container to cool down. Once the solution has cooled down it contains more sodium acetate than it normally would be able to dissolve while at room temperature. This is called &quot;supersaturated.&quot; Supersaturated solutions are really good at growing crystals. Once a small amount of sodium acetate left over from the bottom of the pan is placed in the supersaturated solution (in the gif this is a small crystal on the end of the wooden dowel) the sodium acetate in solution begins to crystalize. </p>
<p>TLDR: Boiling water can dissolve more material than cold water. Boil water, add max amount of material. Cool water down and there is &quot;too much&quot; material in the water. This &quot;too much&quot; material will form crystals in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not freezing. It's <em>nucleation</em>, which in this case is basically building crystals. The bit of residue on the skewer gives a point for the solid in the solution to stick to, and what's shown in the GIF is the solute building a big crystal around the skewer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clear liquid is known as a supersaturated solution. In this case, of sodium acetate. By using only a little water, the maximum amount of solid is dissolved when it's hot.  When it cools down, it ought to crystalize out but it can't because there's nothing to start the them off.  When some crystals are added they act as centres for more molecules to form round.</p>
<p>But there's something else too.  Sodium acetate, like many substances, incorporates molecules of water in its crystals - in this case three per molecule, a trihydrate. So when it crystalizes it uses up all the water in the mix so the whole thing goes solid instead of forming a slush.  That's why the second demo forms a solid pillar as you pour the solution onto the stuff that's crystalized already.</p>
<p>ETA
If you try it yourself make sure that the equipment is clean, particularly the jar you pour the hot solution into to cool.  Dust, or even scratches on the glass, can be places where crystalization can start before you're ready to put the &quot;seed&quot; in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To freeze somthing from a liquid to a solid you have to remove energy from it, usually by putting in in the freezer.<br />
When a super saturated solution &quot;freezes&quot;, all that energy has to go somewhere, so it heats up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
