		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a fixed amount of water available in the basin that varies only slowly over decade time scales. So if Ethiopia builds a dam close to the source of the water and stores it there this will have results downstream. A minor effect would be the evaporation from the lake which would be lost to the region (the recycling factor in the Ethiopian highlands is small). A major effect would be a quick fill which would temporarily cut off water supply to the downstream areas. A long term effect would be that in times of drought Ethiopia has control over the distribution and can keep more water for itself. All of these are negative effects for Egypt's water security. As for the claim that Egypt's waterflow is increased by reducing Lake Nasser evaporation, this is really a wry statement. It means that they might reduce the level of Lake Nasser by siphoning of more water upstream thereby decreasing the volume of the lake and the area from which it can evaporate. That might slightly reduce evaporation in Egypt which is what they could mean by &quot;increased water flow&quot; but I don't see how Egypt's total water budget would increase because of this.</p>
<p>That said, if Ethiopia's dam is properly managed it might increase the overall water security of the region, something that would also benefit Egypt. It all depends on the amount of irrigation Ethiopia is going to develop with this dam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of folks mentioning evaporation, which is correct, but another factor would be infiltration. Depending on the hydrology of the bottom of Lake Nasser and the newly-dammed lake, surface water could be lost to the ground at different rates in both locations. </p>
<p>Of course, groundwater infiltration may be a good thing for the groundwater basin that is being infiltrated, however if you only look at surface flow, you may not account for such a benefit.</p>
<p>TL;DR: You are losing water both out of the top and the bottom of a reservoir.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dam will reduce evaporation (deeper water with less relative surface area), but Egypt WILL get less water while the dam fills (could take a year or more depending drought), and then they are reliant on Ethiopia to let the water flow. I see no reason why Ethiopia would ever send that &quot;saved water&quot; to Egypt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid will only evaporate from the surface exposed to air, and so is dependent on and relative to exposed surface area. As you fill a container with liquid, the surface area exposed to air will by necessity increase at a slower rate than the volume being stored, if at all (in the case of vertical or narrowing container walls as height increases). So the deeper your container is filled, the slower evaporation will happen relative to the volume of liquid contained within. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially what occurs in California as well. With the vast majority of water flowing from reservoirs in the Northern part of the State to dry areas in the Southern parts, Los Angeles and San Diego. </p>
<p>There has been a long standing fight to build additional tunnels in the Sacramento area to allow more water to flow down south. Massive interests on both sides fighting for billions of dollars in water rights. Anytime state legislation may impact water flow in California an army of lobbyists and attorneys descend on the capitol.</p>
<p>The Water Education Foundation has some great resources to learn more about water. Here's a good link to California's Delta water issues.</p>
