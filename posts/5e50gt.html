	<title>ELI5: Does anyone know how our brains are able to warp our perception of time? For example a dream lasts seconds in reality, but it feels like it can last days sometimes. Or an intense psychedelic experience can make minutes feel like hours. How is this possible?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't actually have the capacity to perceive time very well.  A person in a room without stimulation very quickly loses the track of time - there is some fascinating studies of sensory deprivation and perception of time where people think they've been in isolation for 3 days and it's been a day and so on.  We don't seem to have a very reliable internal clock, despite <em>feeling</em> like we do - it must be anchored very heavily in the world around us, receiving constant cues.</p>
<p>So...in our normal world, the queues of time passing are all around us.  People speak at a certain pace, the clock ticks according to physics and the sun rises and the sunset.....plus a gazillion of other &quot;anchors&quot; stimuli.</p>
<p>In the dream state the stimuli and the perception of them are all coming from one place.  As an analogy if you attached the &quot;fast forward&quot; button to both the movie AND your eyes/ears then it would still appear to running at &quot;regular speed&quot;.  Similarly, the dream only takes a second to the third party, anchored in external-stimuli world, but the dreamer is untethered and is both the movie player and the viewer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually just listened to a podcast about this.  Our frontal cortex is responsible for our perception of time. During sleep our frontal lobe shuts down so we stop perceiving time.  We know this because we stop producing alpha waves and move towards beta/theta. This is called a flow state and is when we are most creative.  You can do many various things to trigger this state and psychoactive drugs is one of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So wait a few questions about time perception. </p>
<p>Why do certain actions actually slow down time? </p>
<p>I've personally have been, &quot;in the zone&quot; a few times in my life. During sports, fights, and life threatening situations. </p>
<p>Also if dreams are happening quite quickly because they are &quot;remembered&quot; --- how does that explain lucid dreaming? </p>
<p>(Now I can't lucid dream very well because I always wake up once I become aware. Yet the few times I have done it have been incredible.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is personal observation - I feel like my perception of time is related to a sort of thoughts/experiences/feelings-per-second like a sort of internal thought-clock.</p>
<p>As an experiment for this, when I would wake up in the morning and not want to get up, I'd hit my 5min snooze, and then I'd turn over, close my eyes, and just think: &quot;<em>thoughthoughthoughthoughthoughtthinkthinkthinkfastfastfastthinkthoughtothinkfastthoughtthink...</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>I'd keep this up for a long time easily 5 minutes, turn over, and see that 2 minutes had passed.  I could basically trick myself on how much time had passed by thought-vocalizing nonsense at super-speed.</p>
<p>Now let's get into some more specific stuff on dreams.</p>
<p>First, you don't dream the whole time you're asleep.  You dream in little spurts (REM sleep) in-between what is essentially unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Second, if my personal experience is correct, you probably think/experience things <em>faster</em> in dreams.  Most of your sensory input is suppressed or disabled, and my guess is that unburdens your brain from activity and distractions, and you essentially think quicker.  Nothing inception-level, but the general concept is there.</p>
<p>If you combine those two things, you can start to get a reasonable explanation for why you can fall asleep for 8 hours, and only feel like you've dreamt for 2.  And how you can also turn over after waking up, and go back to dreaming for what feels like a half hour... but wake up to your 5 minute snooze alarm.</p>
<p>When you dream, you think faster, and your sense of time is tied to that, so you feel more time has passed.  But you also have long periods of unconsciousness, where you think no time passes, so the overall estimate of time gets warped.</p>
<p>This is pretty muh all speculation, but since we're literally talking about consciousness itself, you're not going to get much better than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
