		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are two things at play here.  Federal laws superiority over state law, and the government utilizing its ability to prioritize where it spends its limited resources.</p>
<p>So when the federal government says possession and sale of pot is illegal.  It absolutely is illegal and if you were arrested for it, even in a state that legalized it, you would absolutely be found guilty and punished under federal law.</p>
<p>But the thing is the only way that happens is if someone actually arrests you, and since the states decided they weren't going to participate in enforcing that particular federal law the federal government hasn't really bothered to put in the effort to do it themselves.  Just because something is illegal on the federal level doesn't mean state officials must arrest people for it.  <del>They're allowed to</del> (Edit: It looks like they're not normally allowed to, thanks for the correction!), but it's not required.</p>
<p>On the other hand we have gay marriage.  States already perform marriage, they're in the marrying people game. The supreme court effectively said you're not allowed to refuse marriages to people who want to marry someone just because of their sex.</p>
<p>The difference here is that if the states don't enforce federal pot laws, there aren't any victims who can sue.  Who is harmed by not being arrested?</p>
<p>But the states <strong>must</strong> not discriminate in marriage anymore, if they do individuals would be able to sue and the courts would compel marriage officials to perform the act, or send them to jail.</p>
<p>The main bit is, no one is a victim when states refuse to enforce federal drug laws.  But there would be victims if states refused to follow the Supreme court ruling on same-sex marriages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Colorado &quot;legalized&quot; weed, they did not say &quot;this law doesn't apply here anymore&quot;, they said &quot;we will no longer use our <strong>state</strong> resources to enforce this law, if you (the federal government) want to enforce this law in Colorado, do it yourself.&quot; And this does happen occasionally: California had some medical marijuana dispensaries raided and shut down by the DEA. If California had tried to prevent those raids, then they would have overstepped their power and been in trouble.</p>
<p>Regarding today's ruling: the Supreme Court decides if laws passed in the U.S. are allowed by the Constitution. They decided that gay marriage bans are not. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and all levels of government (federal, state, and local) have to follow it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Constitution &amp; the laws of the United States (i.e. federal laws) are the supreme law of the land... but only within the arena that they're allowed to operate.  State laws reign supreme within the arena that they're allowed to operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Helpful Background</strong></p>
<p>The Constitution lists specific powers that the federal government may exercise.  If something's not on that list, the federal government cannot pass a law about it.  This is why so much of what the federal govt does is offer money.  So when the federal government wanted the drinking age to be raised to 21, they couldn't just pass a law to make it so.  They told every state to pass a law doing that, otherwise the state will lose out on federal highway funds (and states really depend on that money).  The federal government didn't just have the authority to do that on their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ELI5 version: It's like parents and their children after high school.  &quot;Billy, you're technically an adult now and can make your own choices.  I can't force you to go to college if you don't want to go.  However, I'm willing to pay for your apartment and car insurance so you can focus on your studies, if you choose to go.  If you don't go to college, I won't help pay for those expenses.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Drug Laws</strong></p>
<p>The Constitution gives Congress the supreme authority to regulate &quot;trade among the several states&quot; (i.e. <strong>inter</strong>state commerce, or commerce that happens from one state to another).  States have supreme authority^t to regulate <strong>intra</strong>state commerce, or commerce contained solely within that state.  This is why it was so hard for Congress to make racial discrimination illegal when it was practiced by privately-owned, local restaurants or hotels.  They generally don't have authority over such matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, through their laws regulating <strong>inter</strong>state commerce, Congress has made certain drugs illegal.  Those drugs remain illegal today, in spite of specific states' legalization efforts.  If you carry marijuana from Washington, where it's legal, to neighboring Oregon, where it's also legal, you'd still be in violation federal law.  But because the federal government can't regulate <strong>intra</strong>state commerce, if you stay within Washington you'd be ok.^t</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ELI5 version:  Your school likely has different rules than Mommy and Daddy have at home.  The school can't force you to line up single file with your siblings when it's time to go from your bedroom to the kitchen.  Likewise, your parents can't force the school to let you jump on their furniture and run around like a little shit the way they do at home.  Each authority is supreme within its arena, they're just in charge of different things.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Same-sex Marriage</strong></p>
<p>The final piece of this puzzle centers around Constitutional rights and the difference between what is <strong>constiutional</strong> and what is <strong>legal</strong>.  States and Congress both have the ability to pass laws that are unconstitutional, and they do so fairly regularly.  So if Congress were to make a law tomorrow that establishes the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/about/" target="_blank">Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> as the official religion of the United States, that would be absolutely <strong>legal</strong> until the Court strikes it down as <strong>unconstitutional</strong>.  (Side note because I can't help myself: politicians who support the NSA's mass collection of digital information will tout all day that &quot;the collection is <em>legal</em>.&quot;  That doesn't mean much if the <strong>law</strong> that makes it <em>legal</em> violates the 4th Amendment... just because the Court hasn't ruled that yet doesn't mean I can't form my own opinion about its Constitutionality).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the Constitution, among other things, outlines certain fundamental rights (such as expression, religion, the press, etc.).  The 14th Amendment prohibits states from denying to people within their borders the fundamental rights protected by the US Constitution (fun fact: prior to the 14th Amendment, a state was perfectly free to establish an official religion for that state if it wanted to).  So the question for yesterday's court case was: is marriage a fundamental right?  If no, then states may choose or not choose to allow same-sex marriage.  If yes, then the 14th Amendment requires all states to protect that right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ELI5 version: Mommy and Daddy may reign supreme within their home when it comes to their rules, but children have fundamental human rights, and included in this is a protection from abuse.  So Mommy and Daddy can be forced to submit to outside authorities when it comes to abuse of their children, even though they are allowed to make their own rules in most every other aspect of life.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>^t There are a few Supreme Court cases that abandon this principle, but that's a story for another day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: The Court hasn't yet decided that freedom from weed is a fundamental right, but they have now decided that marriage is.  And when it comes to fundamental rights, you can't deny that!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are going over to your friends house. The Feds are your friends parents, and the states are your friend's siblings. Everyone has their rules. </p>
<p>Obviously the parent's rules supersedes everything but all the children have thier own house rules too. But whatever we don't care about them just your one friend you visit. </p>
<p>The parents are not cool with pot so it's not okay to smoke it, but hey your friend is cool and says you can smoke in their room with a few of his &quot;cool&quot; siblings. They don't rat you out to their parents and all is cool. If you get caught by the parents? Your friend ain't gonna back you up, you're only 5 after all... </p>
<p>So now you like this cool friend a lot but you are both dudes and his siblings say that's not cool and make fun of you. You don't care and say you want to marry him. They say that's gross and you can't do it. You go to the parents and ask if it's okay. They say yes so even if those other siblings don't like it who cares,  they all still live in the parent's house. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The constitution is the supreme law of the land.  That means that laws that violate the constitution are overturned.  The ruling on gay marriage says that it is a constitutional right,  so state laws that prohibit marriage are now overturned.  Federal laws also trump state laws on things like drugs.  However,  the federal government can't enforce all of the laws it has passed,  so it has to pick and choose priorities.  Marijuana is a low priority.  States with laws allowing marijuana know this so they have created their own laws allowing marijuana.  Those laws conflict with federal law.  If the FBI or DEA wanted to raid every medical and retail marijuana shop in Colorado and prosecute those involved, or burn the crops of growers,  they could. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
