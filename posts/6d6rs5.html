<p>My answer from that thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the kid wants to be comfortable, and the water doesn't.  </p>
<p>Deadweight, like the water, is harder to carry because it doesn't do anything like, say, maintain it's own center of gravity---or, in the case of an older kid, actually hold on to you, thus distributing the weight across more of your muscles.  </p>
<p>As a result, you need to use your own power to do all the little things necessary to keep the weight oriented they way you want it to be oriented.  That makes it seem heavier.  The water might slosh around or get slightly off center from how you are carrying it some other way, and you then have to consciously or sub-consciously correct it.  The kid, on the other hand, probably wants to stay generally upright and generally in the same place/orientation as after you lifted them, taking that pressure off.*</p>
<p>*assuming not a toddler. Their weight is effectively quintupled from sheer madness. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you truly concerned with picking up the weight as much as holding the weight because there is a difference? And the method of picking up the weight will make a big difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you pick the up either the child or dumbbell with extended arms and hands it will seem to weight more than if you picked it up by hugging it. Hugging it has less impact on your arms and hands.</li>
<li>If you pick the up either the child or dumbbell with either extended arms and hands or by hugging it will seem lighter if you stoop down with bended knees than if you were bent over at the waist. Thus more parts of your body help to lift the weight.</li>
<li>As a tall slender mass, the child's weight is unevenly distributed, with the bulk of it in the torso, and can help support and balance his/her own weight, unlike a dumbbell of equal weight that is compact and is unable to help support its own weight.</li>
<li>The child is a tall slender object that can be held snug to your body with your arms wrapped around the child, which makes supporting the weight easier than holding in equal weight in a different shaped mass in your extended hands. And the child can hug you to help support the weight.</li>
<li>If you carried the child on your shoulder or back he or she would seem even lighter because doing so makes the child's weight part of your own weight and balance system.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers, but none seem to have mentioned an important factor: isolation. </p>
<p>When you do a bicep curl with a dumbbell, good form helps you use only your bicep, so you can specifically challenge that muscle. You intentionally minimize involvement of your triceps, pecs, delts, etc. Similarly for most other simple free weight motions. </p>
<p>When you reach down to pick up a child, you're making a complex movement and aren't intentionally isolating any one muscle. You recruit a bunch of muscle groups to share the load, and it feels easier. </p>
<p>Unless it's an angry toddler - then their bones just turn to jelly and suddenly all their squirmy uneven weight is focused on a muscle you didn't know you needed! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's because children have a natural ability to distribute their weight in such a way that's optimal for the person picking them up and that's why it's equally difficult to handle them if they go deadweight on you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the weight distribution, when you're holding a child your bringing it closer to your center of gravity, and making your body more stable this stability allows for less work to be done in muscles of your body . If you were to hold the child like you hold a dumbbell you would find that they feel about the same. This is the same reason why grocery bags feel insanely heavy, because often times you're holding them at an awkward angle away from your center of gravity. </p>
