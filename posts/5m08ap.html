		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are very social animals (i.e. social interactions are crucial to our survival), so we have lots of traits that exist only to act as signals in communication. As far as I know, we cry for the same reason we smile or raise our eyebrows - to signal our emotions to others.</p>
<p>I have also heard about there being pheromones in tears that can influence the behavior of other people exposed to them, but I don't know much about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying is evolutionary beneficial. It shows that something is wrong. Most of the time we can simply make noise to show that something is wrong, but some times, when we are suffocating for example, we have no way to express that we are in danger. Here, crying can be the solution to let others know we need help.  </p>
<p>Now, crying or being extremely happy aren't 'normal' situations, so the body interprets this as 'wrong'. Even though being extremely happy isn't bad, it's still seen as abnormal by the body, and thus a potential danger to our survival. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying, i've heard actually releases some of the anxiety producing hormones we make when we get upset out of our bodies within the production of tears. Accumulation of these hormones or chemicals caused by feelings of sadness or happiness can disrupt homeostasis, causing the body to find a way to regain balance in its chemistry. </p>
<p>There is also a heavy social reason as many have previously listed and explained. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying releases excess stress hormones (like cortisol), which is why you often feel a sense of relief or calmness after a good cry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we're extremely stressed or laughing hard our lung muscles tighten up. We cry because sometimes when under extreme emotion we can't communicate it with sound so our body communicates it from ejecting water from our eyes and making it really obvious, so everyone else knows something is up even if we can't communicate it. A huge part of human survival roots in compassion and empathy. If something is wrong, you <strong>have</strong> to communicate it to others.</p>
<p>Also, as some people have said, crying releases stress hormones through the tear duct so we can calm ourselves down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
