		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So our liver is responsible for the processing of alcohol. Each cell in your liver has an organelle called the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER, which are in all of our cells but is very prominent in liver cells). One job of this organelle is to breakdown and detox substances like drugs and alcohol. When someone goes on a drinking binge, their liver cells recognize that they have to process more alcohol than usual. These cells are able to dramatically increase the surface area of their SER, even within a few days, which in turn allows for the detoxification of a larger volume of alcohol. </p>
<p>If you were to look at the liver cells of an alcoholic, they would have much larger SERs than a non-alcoholic. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am so excited about this question that is both interesting and relevant to my research area!!</p>
<p>There are definitely physiological components to tolerance, but much of tolerance is learned/behavioral! The brain prefers to be in the normal state that it is in when we are sober. It tries to balance out any alterations in that state when we consume psychoactive drugs so that it can function normally. So, after repeated experiences drinking alcohol, the brain learns how to compensate for those effects. </p>
<p>The way the brain knows when to do this is by environmental cues telling the brain that we are about to get drunk! So, if you put a heavy drinker in a bar environment, even without actually consuming alcohol, they will show signs that their body is preparing them to tolerate alcohol on various levels. For example, it is known that when alcoholics are cued with alcohol-related information (e.g., shown a beer, brought to a bar, etc), they automatically widen their gait to adjust for alcohol's effects on balance!!! There is lots of cool research on how alcohol-related cuing alters behavior. Some of my research looks at how alcohol-related cuing alters which memories are most accessible and changes social behavior!</p>
<p>One really cool demonstration of how we LEARN tolerance involves giving people substances they can usually tolerate well in an unexpected context-- they lose their tolerance! For example, if a regular coffee drinker is given coffee intravenously, their heart beat increases much more than if they consumed the coffee orally! You would also probably also get more of a boost from taking a caffeine pill than drinking a cup of coffee, because the smell, sight, and taste of the coffee all serve as memory cues that prepare us for the effects of caffeine. Some of the most compelling examples of this involve cases of accidental overdose among individuals with opiate addiction. It has been observed that opiate addicts using their usual amount of the drug in completely novel contexts has resulted in death, which is thought to be a result of their body failing to anticipate the respiratory-suppresant effects of opioids.</p>
<p>One term used to refer to this memory function is &quot;expectancy.&quot; Expectancy is the part of our memory that uses familiar environmental cues to tell us how to behave in situations that we have already experienced without us having to consciously think about it-- because conscious resources are limited and precious! Think about when you get behind the wheel of a car-- the driving behaviors come to you automatically, you don't have to consciously think about them! A similar process governs drug tolerance, and basically any behavior that we learn so well that it becomes automatic!</p>
<p>There is a super fascinating article that explains this all really well while discussing issues of context and tolerance as it relates to the Four Loko beverage. I highly recommend this article!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another problem with alcohol is that it makes the phospholipid membrane of our cells more fluid. This is why wiping down stuff with alcohol kills bacteria: the membranes get more fluid, and the shear stress of the wipe rips the bacteria apart.
If the human body however has to deal with high concentrations of alcohol on a daily basis, this is a problem. The cells respond by adding more cholesterol into the membranes, because the cholesterol molecule is quite rigid. It helps to keep the cells together. However, if the person then decides to stop drinking cold turkey, the cells will instead be too rigid, or hard. And this is the reason for the physical pain during cold turkey. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add another layer of complexity:
Apart from the alcohol dehydrogenase, there is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsomal_ethanol_oxidizing_system" target="_blank">MEOS</a>.<br />
This alternate pathway increases it's activity after chronic alcohol consumption. As far as i know, this is the reason why chronic alcoholics are able to survive normally lethal levels of blood alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there is physiological tolerance in the liver and in the up regulation of receptors in the brain, but there is also behavioural tolerance. </p>
<p>Seasoned drinkers eat with alcohol, drink water and are generally used to the feeling of being drunk. In the same way you put a sweater on when you know itâ€™s going to be cold outside, experience teaches people how to deal with alcohol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
