		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all depression is equal. I have bipolar disorder, and while depression is part of it, it is not the same disorder as standard (unipolar) depression. Bipolar is alternating episodes of depression and mania. Giving someone with bipolar an SSRI often actually triggers mania:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The symptoms of mania include: elevated mood, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, difficulty maintaining attention, increase in goal-directed activity, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. These manic symptoms significantly impact a person's daily living.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people with bipolar are diagnosed when they having a depressive episode, and you can't tell the difference from regular depression, so that's what you assume is going on. So you take antidepressants and you get better! In fact, you feel great! SO awesome. Very productive! I'm amazing, I'm going to change the world, who needs to sleep, isn't everything FANTASTIC?! Hypomania, the more common lesser form of mania (vs say, psychotic mania), can often be sustainable for quite a while. </p>
<p>I was diagnosed with bipolar after being depressed, taking Prozac, and <em>going out of my mind</em>, absolutely off the deep end, hypomanic. But I thought it was great! I was super happy! I mean, my life was falling apart because I was batshit crazy, impulsive, delusional and scared people. But hey, I wasn't depressed, so the drugs were working!! It took almost a year to figure it out and change to suitable medication.</p>
<p>So yeah, that can happen when someone who is not actually depressed (although exhibits symptoms indistinguishable from depression) takes an SSRI. It made me TOO happy. Basically, too <em>everything</em>. Too much energy, too many impulses, you're gonna have a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For fucks sake stop with the anecdotes and speculation. The placebo effect is damn powerful.
My research focuses on antidepressant use and I've taken classes under the first researchers who determined serotonin was even used in the brain. Whenever we use antidepressants in research we need control groups. With lab animals, this means routinely giving antidepressants to non-depressed subjects. </p>
<p>Studies in mice show increased resilience to stress and increased exploratory behavior. In some studies it also increases anxiety. I'm on my phone right now but if this post gets enough attention I'll dig up sources later. And to all who say it doesn't matter if it works in mice, we discover all our drugs this way, 90% of the time it works 100% of the time. </p>
<p>It's also been shown to improve outcomes with stroke patients, people with nerve damage, head injury, people with chronic fatigue, and anxiety. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>while I can't give any scientific reasoning, I can tell you personally that they definitely have a big effect on my emotions.
I don't have depression but I do get bad migraines and a certain antidepressant is the only thing that I have been prescribed that help at all.
I am typically a happy and positive person, I enjoy everything about my life. When I take antidepressants, that essentially goes to shit. I become moody, highly overemotional, and experience many 'down days' at times which aren't unlike classic symptoms of depression where nothing can improve my mood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I almost removed the post because it is posing a hypothetical, however since this is a hypothetical that actually happens, why not discuss. </p>
<p>Most anti depressents fall into a class of drugs called SSRI's or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. They do exactly what the name suggests, they slow down or inhibit, the re-uptake or absorption / recycling of serotonin. </p>
<p>Serotonin is a neurochemical responsible for the neuron to neuron conduction of signals. The signals are electrical, but the transmission is done chemically and the serotonin controls the rate of this transmission. </p>
<p>What is supposed to happen is an impulse is transmitted between two neurons at the synapse, serotonin is used, and then it is reabsorbed to prepare for the next impulse. The theory of SSRI's effect on depression is that depression is caused by lower impulse rates which inhibit communication within the brain. That the conduction of signals from neuron to neuron is not working at the level of a healthy brain. You might say it's running too slow, or not responsive enough to the communication that jumps around between different lobes of the brain. </p>
<p>So they have these drugs and they inhibit the uptake of serotonin and this leads to higher levels of serotonin, which in turn facilitates easier neuron to neuron transmission across the synapses. In other words it sort of speeds up or facilitates better neuron to neuron conduction. It doesn't make you think faster exactly, but instead allows the communication in the brain to work faster and be more responsive rather than isolated and sluggish as in the depressed brain. </p>
<p>So if you gave an SSRI to someone who's brain was not in a physical state of depression, it would have the same action as if used on a depressed brain. It would facilitate faster neural signalling. What this would mean for the person taking the pill is much the same as what it would mean for a depressed person taking it. </p>
<p>Sexual side effects, changes in mood, altered perception, strange thoughts, changes in sleep patterns, drug use, and personality. The same effects for all. But in a depressed mind, these side effects are less damaging than the depression itself, so it's a good trade off. If someone is really depressed, and in danger of hurting themselves or someone else, the SSRI's along with mood stabilizers like Lithium  or alprazolam can keep them stable until they can get past the crisis. They can work very well in short term therapy. In the long term people can develop resistance, and find they have to adjust dosage and maybe even try other SSRI's in order to keep getting the therapeutic effects. For this reason drugs are usually prescribed along with therapy in order to help a person through the crisis, and give them some stability to start coming to terms with it or fixing the root cause if there is one. </p>
<p>I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. I do have experience with this though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. Long time user of antidepressants here. To truly ELI5: Taking antidepressants (SSRI) has an effect kind of like focusing a camera. There is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where everything is in focus (not depressed). If the serotonin levels are above or below that depression occurs. Antidepressants boost the effect of the serotonin present. If it's already at the correct level, it may be pushed beyond the sweet spot and cause problems. Therefore, if a person who didn't need antidepressants took them, it may cause depression. Of course, the real world is not so clean cut and actual effects and side effects will vary from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
