<p>This means that only authorised code can run, for example in iOS you can only run apps signed by Apple from the App Store; unless you jailbreak it. </p>
<p>Consoles are the same. </p>
<p>On normal computer you can do whatever you want, which allows bad stuff in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the comments here are absolutely correct.  There are a ton of reasons why laptop/desktops see more viruses than smartphones and consoles.  I would say the top two reasons said by u/Gnomio1 and u/ckindley argue that creaters of malware are going to focus there energy on what gives the greatest return.</p>
<p>On top of that it comes down to the type of data.  PCs (even most enterprise servers/storage) run block or file data.  Mobile devices (excluding consoles here) tend to access data through object storage.  TL;DR basically means PCs are predictable and the ways we access than is well known.  Mobile devices are still new.  It takes someone who keeps up with modern programming languages to attack.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day there are fewer people who know how to attack mobile devices and it's more cost effective to go after PCs.  Combine the two and there's your answer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With great power comes great responsibility.<br />
A home computer is pretty much anything goes, which is great for people who needs lots of options. A smartphone or console is much more limited in what it can do, so it's harder (but not impossible) for bad software to get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The existing comments are all great ideas. I would add this:</p>
<p>Think of what you might target as a producer of malware, whether that's ransomware or otherwise. Going after end users is not going to be profitable. End users don't often have the cash to shell out to ransom their files. So malware producers target businesses that can shell out large sums of cash as ransom (either because they have no backups, have bad backups, or it's cheaper to ransom the files and restore than to recover the backups). With certain industries there may be trade secrets to steal and sell, or perhaps a state-sponsored malware attack on the strategic utility or industry.</p>
<p>And what do you know, those bigger players all run Windows. Even if they use Linux servers, workstations are the way to get at the file servers easily and efficiently. And users are still the #1 attack vector.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason virsuses are less apparent outside of the PC ecosystem as others have said is the walled gardens provided by Apple/Google/Sony/Microsoft. </p>
<p>The issue is that on a PC a user is getting everything from a third party rather then from an &quot;app store&quot; that is managed an authority. This often leads to people downloading malware as Trojans while trying to find a bit of software if they navigate to the wrong URL or find the wrong bit of software to do a job they need.</p>
<p>This is more apparent on mobile when people start downloading apps on Android from sources other then the Play Store this is why by default this is blocked and has to have a setting changed before you can do this. </p>
<p>A major example I can think of is all the malware that came along while people where trying to obtain Pokemon GO from outside of the Play Store while it was only available in limited regions</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
