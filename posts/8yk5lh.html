		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putting compressed gas through a nozzle to let it expand and cool (Joule-Thomson Effect, as used in every fridge and air conditioner) seems inefficient for cooling.  Why don't we instead take the same volume, pressure and temperature compressed gas and make it do work by putting it through a turbine?  </p>
<p>Even if the energy from doing the work were entirely wasted, the resulting gas would be significantly colder, and therefore better for refrigeration.</p>
<p>In reality, we could also use the energy from the turbine, potentially gearing it to the compressor to reduce electricity usage.</p>
<p>EDIT:  It seems what I'm describing is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboexpander#Refrigeration_system" target="_blank">turboexpander</a>.  Wikipedia reports them as more efficient than regular throttling nozzles, so I guess my question becomes &quot;Why doesn't everyone do this if they're more efficient?&quot;.</p></div></div>

<p>I work in Automotive Climate Control. Cost and reliability are the biggest drivers in the auto industry and this sounds like something that wouldn't make a large system wide difference, but would add headaches in terms of things like reliability and system complexity. The turboexpander would have to be able to handle two-phase flow and remain operable for the lifetime of the vehicle. Also the cost for this component is going to go up when you consider that it will have many more parts, and have many more manufacturing steps and engineering tests done on it.</p>
<p>Space is also valued highly, having to find more room for the turboexpander where it could usefully extract work and be connected to the refrigerant transport lines might not currently be feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Joule-Thompson effect is pretty much negligible in a refrigeration cycle. Itâ€™s the phase change that transfers the large bulk of the heat. The working fluid is vapourized to absorb heat, then condensed again to reject that heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
