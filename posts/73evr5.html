		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, speech and swallowing therapist here. A mix of good  and off-the-wall answers in the thread. I wanted to add a bit of anatomy to clarify.</p>
<p>Your airway and esophagus are right next to each other. They are separated by a teeeny bit of tissue. Both start at the back of your throat, below the base of your tongue. It's almost like there is a floor that has 2 holes in it, right next to each other. </p>
<p>When we talk about the airway, it's useful to break it into 2 parts: upper and lower. The dividing line betweeen upper and lower is your  voice box, aka your vocal cords. You can find those by finding your Adam's Apple (even women have a small one). Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. </p>
<p>Your upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area. Drinking water can remove stuff in this area and flush it into the esophagus where it's supposed to go.</p>
<p>Your lower airway (below your vocal cords, including trachea and tubes that go down to your lungs) is not very sensitive. Have you ever seen someone with a tracheostomy tube? There is a tube in their trachea and it doesn't hurt! The trachea is made of cartilage. It doesn't have a lot of blood supply or nerves. So you really don't feel stuff in your trachea.</p>
<p><strong>TL; DR When you think you are feeling something in your trachea, it really isn't in your trachea. It's way higher up.</strong></p>
<p>Hope this clarifies a little. And I'm happy to answer any other questions about breathing and swallowing. It's literally my job.</p>
<p>edit: changed a few words about the quality of other responses because i realized a lot of answers in this thread were really wacky! No we don't get hydrated because water passes over our cells. Our throat cells stay moist because of mucus. Lots of mucus.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of PMs and questions about your personal swallowing and speech issues. Keep in mind I can't diagnose or treat you over the internet.  Also, a lot of folks wanting to know if they should get professional help for their medical issues. The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist. We're here to help. We're just way more effective in person.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying that drinking water would not help if the problem was in your windpipe (at least it would not help until the water circulated through your system). The problem with a dry throat would likely be because of your mucous membranes drying out (although being sick can also make your mouth/throat feel dry). Drinking water would help to revitalize them.</p>
<p>If the reason you are coughing is because some food or something went down the wrong pipe, water would not help in that instance. When you are coughing, you are building up air behind your vocal folds, which close in order to allow that buildup, and then the air is blown out in a burst to expel the object. Drinking water would not help here, only if the problem is in your throat and not your windpipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time an irritant is somewhere in your pharynx (the area behind your nose and mouth but before your voice box; the back of your throat). This irritant will cause you to  cough even though it's not a problems in your lungs or trachea themselves. Water passes over most of your pharynx on the way to your esophagus, and can relieve the irritation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the time it's some foreign particle that's stuck to the throat. When you drink water or some liquid like that it washes the particle down with it removing the irritant, or in the case of dry throat rehydrating the mucous layer. But for stuff such as tears or some kind of a wound you need something that either provides local anesthesia or something with consistency of a syrup which can stick to the area lubricating or protecting the region long enough for the active ingredients to start working.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;throat&quot; is essentially the pharynx which leads to the esophagus for digestion. In the pharyngeal cavity, however, you have the laryngeal cavity including the epiglottis, and larynx , that leads to the trachea. So the pharyngeal cavity in its entirety gets wet (though the epiglottis shields the entrance of the airway ). Drinking water wouldn't help if water had entered the airway causing aspiration and choking, and causing the cough. However if you have a dry pharynx or an irritant that is causing a cough, water may help moisten the pharyngeal walls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
