<p>Low scores indicate that people either aren't reading the questions or they are forgetting how they answered similar questions (I.e., they're lying).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rewording the same 'core' of a question and asking it in different ways can help with this. Anonymous responses also can do - that's a control to combat our impulse to only give socially desirable responses.  </p>
<p>It's also important to recognise that there are <em>consciously</em> false answers and <em>unconscious</em> falsehoods. For instance that <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/05/only-2-say-they-are-below-average-intelligence/" target="_blank">practically everyone</a> considers themselves to be of average/above average intelligence. Repeated surveys asking the same questions in different settings and with different groups can build up a wider store of knowledge about likely responses such that, for instance, if I am asking something that is related to intelligence I can control for an over-reporting of 'above average' and an under-reporting of 'below average'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Data analyst on surveys here.  Here are some techniques we use in practice...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In large enough populations, we may use 'trimmed means'.  For example, we would throw out the top and bottom 10% of responses.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a larger questionnaire, you can use control questions to throw out people who are just 'marking every box the same way', or aren't really considering the question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our surveys are for lawsuits, and the respondents are often known people, and we have other data on them.  So we can compare their answers to their data, to get a measure of reasonableness.  In rare cases where there are mis-matches, we might adjust our results, or state that our results may be over- or under-estimated.</p>
</li>
<li>Looking at IP addresses of responses may help determine is significant numbers of people are using VPN or other methods to 'vote early, vote often'.  Limiting responses to certain IP addresses may be helpful.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the great answers people have already provided, there is another technique that, I think, is pretty darn cool, that is particularly useful to gauging the prevalence of behaviors one might be ashamed to admit. </p>
<p>It works like this: </p>
<p>Say you want to determine the rate of intravenous drug use, for example. </p>
<p>For half of the respondents, provide a list of 4 actions, a list that does <em>not</em> include intravenous drug use, and say &quot;how many have you done in the last month/year/whatever&quot;. Not <em>which</em>, but <em>how many</em>. </p>
<p>For the other half of respondents, provide a list of 5 things, the 4 from before, <em>plus</em> intravenous drug use, and again ask how many.</p>
<p>The difference in the average answers between the two groups indicates the rate of intravenous drug use among the respondents. </p>
<p>Neat trick, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
