		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the density of the neutrons in question. If you're thinking standard every day densities regularly encountered in everyday life, then the answer is no.</p>
<p>Neutrons cannot exist by themselves for extended periods of time. Outside the extreme gravity fields of a neutron star (we'll get to that in a minute), your average neutron will beta decay with a half life of about 10 minutes, spitting out an electron and a proton, with the leftover mass energy being released as an electron antineutrino. In somewhat rare cases, the decay event will also spit out a gamma ray. In extremely rare cases, the electron does not gain enough energy to escape the proton, and the decay event forms a hydrogen atom, with the antineutrino taking away much more energy than it normally would.</p>
<p>In short, you'd have a fiercely radioactive (and potentially flammable due to the forming hydrogen) and glowing bag of neutrons in your possession.</p>
<p>When a high mass star dies, depending on its composition and how much mass ends up in the core at T-0, it can form a stellar remnant known as a neutron star during the ensuing supernova. The inward force of gravity is no longer balanced by the outward force of thermonuclear fusion (fusion above nickel/iron consumes instead of produces energy), and the core is made of what is known as degenerate matter, where for each atom no 2 electrons can share an identical state (See: Pauli Exclusion Principle). Eventually, the weight of the iron &quot;ash&quot; as well as the rest of the star builds up to the point where electron degeneracy pressure can no longer withstand the pressure, and the electrons take the only way out left to them: by merging with the protons in the core.</p>
<p>In the space of about a second, all of the electrons and protons in the core are consumed, and the resulting lump of matter screams inwards at a very significant fraction of the speed of light. Neutron stars run into another degenerate &quot;barrier&quot; and bounce off, rebounding outwards... right into the collapsing upper layers of star plasma crashing in. Unstoppable force (collapsing upper layers of star) meets immovable object (neutron star core), and you get a supernova as everything above the ball of neutrons goes boom.</p>
<p>After the star has died and supernova faded, we have ourselves a neutron star, a couple-solar mass ball of neutrons and more exotic matter crammed into a space roughly the size of Manhattan Island. This ball of neutrons is <em>extremely</em> hot (600,000 kelvin is the typical surface temperature), very highly magnetized (many many millions of times stronger than Earth's field), is rotating at several hundred revolutions per second (with linear surface velocities pushing up to .24c), and dense enough to where a teaspoon of the stuff weighs more than Mt Everest. The star itself is so dense it generates its own gravitational lensing effect, allowing a viewer to potentially see more than half of the surface at any given time. But the neutrons would be stable.</p>
<p>You still wouldn't want it though. A thimble-full of the stuff would still kill you, whether it be from the heat and radiation cooking you alive, the magnetism ripping all of the iron out of your blood, the attempt at extracting it, the tidal forces it would exert on you, or it exploding when it realizes its no longer being crushed together by several billion Gs of gravity.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Free neutrons can and likely will kill you and will leave an expensive mess for the rest of us to clean up.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are places where you can gather lots of slow neutrons and confine them into a region of space, for example the ultra cold neutron lab <a href="http://lansce.lanl.gov/facilities/ultracold-neutrons/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Neutrons undergo beta decay with a half-life on the order of 10 minutes, so you canâ€™t hold onto them for very long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! I was asked this once, or a similar question...</p>
<p>&quot;What would a teaspoon of neutron star do on Earth?&quot;</p>
<p>A teaspoon of neutron star material moved to standard temperature and pressure (STP) would explode with a force much greater than the largest thermonuclear bomb ever devised. It was being held crushed by gravity, then it isn't. The fast neutrons, powerful radiation in and of themselves, would also be a beta decay source, emitting 100 megawatts of power through pure radioactive decay in the first ten minutes, after the initial enormous explosion. Fast neutrons can also be captured by other elements, turning them radioactive.</p>
<p>Free neutrons decay into an electron and a proton - hydrogen - with a half life of a few minutes. As the cloud of superheated hydrogen expands, incinerating anything in its path, it also consumes oxygen. A teaspoon of neutron star material will form enough hydrogen to deoxygenate enough air to cover a city, but it's already destroyed it from the explosion.</p>
<p>So a teaspoon of neutron star material is basically a massively powerful explosion of radioactivity which turns into hydrogen plasma as it decays, the hydrogen burns in oxygen, the fraction which doesn't decay into hydrogen plasma turns other materials nearby radioactive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutron stars are made up of pretty much just neutrons. The issue is that this neutron gas is incredibly dense. A matchbox full of neutron matter from one such star would weigh about the same as an 800 meter cube of Earth. </p>
<p>If you had a low enough density to be able to carry it, the neutrons would be far enough apart that you wouldnâ€™t see anything, the bag would appear empty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring all of the other super horrendous things that would happen if you had a bag full of neutrons, they would be completely transparent as neutrons almost never interact with photons that are visible to us.</p>
<p>Would they be reactive?  Sort of: Let's assume you had a &quot;dime bag&quot; of neutrons appear in front of you on your table.  Now imagine an ongoing multimegaton nuclear explosion centered on the mass of neutrons that would go on for basically hours on end abating as the neutrons decayed into hydrogen.  This assumes that such a mass of neutrons would be just solid and wouldn't blast itself apart.</p>
<p>All in all...neutrons outside the context of a neutron star or an atomic nucleus are SUPER bad news regardless of the velocity they're moving at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
