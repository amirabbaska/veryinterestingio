		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most computer viruses are created with the intent to profit from them. This can take a few different forms though. Ransomeware encrypts your files until you pay the ransom, this is perhaps the largest threat in recent memory. Others search for data related to banking or other profitable information. Some enable the creator to take over the computer and use it's resources and/or network connection for other nefarious purposes. All that aside, most are created with some form of profit in mind.</p>
<p>Then there are those who create them &quot;because they can&quot;. Ever done something on a dare or because you wanted to see if you could or how far you could go? For some people creating viruses is like that. How many computers can they infect? Are they able to make a virus go worldwide? Personal or public prestige and challenge, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then there's the even smaller subset of white hat viruses. Yeah, that's a thing. There are people who create viruses to patch security vulnerabilities. Example: <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/linux-wifatch-routers-hacked-by-white-hat-virus-that-makes-them-more-secure-against-malware-1522214" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/linux-wifatch-routers-hacked-by-white-hat-virus-that-makes-them-more-secure-against-malware-1522214</a></p>
<p>And sure, some create them for fun. It's not terribly difficult if you know your programming. Since a rather large number of people don't actually update their computers often, <strong>known</strong> security vulnerabilities are easily exploited. Remember WannaCry? The patch for that vulnerability was released <strong>several months</strong> before it became a worldwide problem and gained national news sensationalism. Software providers will discover a vulnerability, release a patch for it, then release the details for the vulnerability and patch some time later after giving people a reasonable amount of time to update their systems. This release also gives hackers a roadmap on how to attack those <em>unpatched</em> systems still online.</p>
<p>Lastly there's the viruses that search for information. Whether government secrets or university research or protected business info, viruses can look for info and report matches back to the creator/controller.</p>
<p>I'm not even going to talk about the nation-state created viruses.</p>
<p>Bottom line is it can be for any reason in the human psyche, but mostly it's for profit. Turn on automatic updates.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people create viruses for shits and giggles. They’ll spend five minutes coding something that will turn your computer off or something when you open it, and that’s all (Source: I have friends who do this all the time) Others just want to watch the world burn</p>
<p>On a serious note, however, viruses that make money usually steal your information (ex: credit card, name and birthday, address) and sell it to marketers. Others encrypt all your files and demand a ransom for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of viruses are created ethically in order to test security systems, antivirus systems, malware detection systems, etc. Far more so than are created to actually be a threat to the average consumer. </p>
<p>Beyond that, a lot of viruses/malware are created in order to mine data about people, which is then sold to larger marketing companies so that they can target ads to your individual preferences and increase sales. </p>
<p>It's very rare for a virus creator to actually be the one targeting you specifically, and that'll only really happen to companies/corporations in order to get a quick buck out of selling them the antivirus counterpart. &quot;Give me $5,000 and I'll give you the program that will fix this virus that has completely shut down your network.&quot; Large companies/corporations will pay off that $5,000 without a thought because they realize that it's a drop in the bucket compared to how much money they're losing by being unable to use their computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make money.
Some people create malware to trick you to run it so they can use your computer to spread more malware and spam and they rent them out to others.
Some make crypto lockers that encrypt all your data and you have to pay them to get your files unlocked.
Some make malware to manipulate your banking software so they can steal money.
Some make malware to manipulate Facebook or Twitter to fuck with the elections in other countries.</p>
<p>It used to be research and see what cool stuff I can do but these days it's mostly money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
