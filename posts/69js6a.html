		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is supposed to apply to social media and ordinary citizens as well, although I doubt that a member of the public tweeting about Le Pen would get into trouble. The authorities will be more worried about the very powerful mass media.</p>
<p>The idea is that voters should have time to think about who they're going to vote for without the distractions of political campaigning. They've heard all the arguments and speeches, and now they need time to digest all that and come to a rational decision, rather than be swayed by whatever headline they glanced at on the way to the polling booth.</p>
<p>It also means that one candidate can't undermine the other by releasing some scandalous revelation on the day of the election, or even the day before.</p>
<p>Other countries have similar measures to ensure a fair election. In the UK, for example, media outlets can't broadcast anything on the day of the election that might favour any particular party; also, from the moment Parliament is dissolved, the government enters into a state of &quot;purdah&quot; (a Persian word meaning &quot;curtain&quot;) and is banned from announcing contentious or controversial legislation. For example, a government that thinks it might lose the election can't introduce a bill for some popular measure that the next government will have to scrap as unworkable, in order to discredit the next government -- that kind of thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/rewboss nailed it but I want to emphasize his point about people having time to digest info before a vote. </p>
<p>It really gives people time to critically think about last minute promises or capitalizing on a tragedy. </p>
<p>In the US, Bloomberg's mayoral inauguration was delayed due to 9/11. That really helped Giuliani gain a lot of ground on his post-mayoral career. Of course, the city of New York had bigger things on its mind than who the mayor was but Le Pen and Macron could do tacky things if something happened. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how it works in France, in Spain we have &quot;El día de reflexión&quot;. Official campaign is over, there are not more electoral acts than Saturday before the Sunday election, but, obviously, the press talks about the election.</p>
<p>One controversial measure that we have in Spain is that it is forbidden to publish polls the last week before the election. </p>
<p>The press have criticized this a lot, however after following the US elections I find that somewhat healthy. Polls have a lot of &quot;cooking&quot; and they can affect the result of the election. The US campaign was 50% scandals, 45% horse race and 5% policy.</p>
<p>The day off before election helps to &quot;clean&quot; a little bit about scandals (however, everyone have decided their vote by then) and the polls shutdown also cleans the news about the state of the race. </p>
<p>I thought the Spanish elections were a shitshow, but this year living in the US have left me without words... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
