		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It dates back to FDR's first 100 days in office. During his first 100, he created a madhouse of policy change, bill drafting, signing, and law shifts in the nation. It was considered so intense that it became common place to measure the first 100 days of newer presidents against it. While we no longer compare to FDR for the 100 day rule, it's generally believed that the first 100 can give us insight into what might be the new norm. If they can hold their promises, unify, or in some sad cases. Divide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effective time that a president can actually govern is a lot shorter than most people think it is.</p>
<p>Congress is elected every 2 years, and they are fairly unlikely to actually get anything done in the year before an election (since everyone's focus is on campaigning, no one wants to take direction from the president during this time).  So your second year is basically toast.  The last year you are running for reelection, so it's toast too.  You only really get your first and third years to do shit.</p>
<p>So the president starts January 21st as their first full day.  Congress is basically useless after December 31st, but nothing happens over Christmas so let's make it Dec 1st. And you lose August since that's Congress's summer break.  So you only really get 9 months in that first year.  </p>
<p>So when it comes down to it, the number 100 is selected basically brutally but it's around 1/3 of your total effective time in the first 2 years.  It's long enough that you should have had time to build your government and get your people confirmed, then move on to the most important parts of making legislation. </p>
<p>In a normal (nontrump) world, legislation is a LONG process.  You start it by proposing a bill, then there's endless debate and amendments before the damn thing actually gets voted on.  For big plans, this can take a long time.  Obamacare took something like 18 months.  So if a president wants to make something happen in their first term, they REALLY need to have already started on it within that first 100 days.</p>
<p>So while the actual 100 number is somewhat arbitrary, having a measuring point for a new president is actually quite useful.</p>
<p>As for why it's not shorter, it takes a few months to get the confirmations through with.  So making it something like 60 days does not have much time for the president to turn their attention to legislation.  Longer might make sense, but really a president does not get very much time and if you make it longer you start to get away from their &quot;beginning&quot; of the presidency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to good answers by /u/TheTurge and /u/Miliean1 , I'd like to add that just because a period of time is arbitrary, doesn't mean that its useless. As long as you're comparing <em>the same</em> arbitrary amount of time between administrations, it's still perfectly valid to make comparisons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of President Trump, a lot of it has to do with the amount of time he spent campaigning about how much he would accomplish and change with his 100 day plan to fix America.  Since the 100 days have passed, people are now looking at the plan and seeing if he accomplished the major parts of it.  That and 100 is a nice round number that most people won't question as a milestone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My 2 cents here, there's a book out out by the Harvard Business Review called &quot;The First 90 Days&quot; that is a good reference for those moving into a new (management) role in a company. The very first line in the book, &quot;The president of the United States gets 100 days to prove himself; you get 90.&quot; It goes on to assert that success within those first few months can go a long way in setting the stage for later success or failure. Part of that onboarding period is when you build your team, start developing and aligning your strategy with how things actually work, earn some early successes, etc. So while the 100 days number may be arbitrary, the concept of &quot;early wins&quot; should not be a foreign concept to a businessperson.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
