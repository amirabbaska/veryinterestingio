<p>So an extra chromosome equals an extra chunk of genetic material that gets expressed.</p>
<p>So that genetic material is getting processed and coding for a bunch of proteins that are already being produced by the other two copies.</p>
<p>And chromosome 21 doesn't have the inactivation ability like the X chromosome, so these proteins just keep getting pumped out, which has an effect on the developing child.</p>
<p>Tl;dr - extra chromosome makes too many proteins. Too many proteins make abnormal baby. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trisomies (an extra chromosome) are a fairly frequent, relatively speaking, cause of early miscarriage.  There are four chromosomes in which an extra copy doesn't produce a spontaneous abortion (medical term for a miscarriage): 13 - causing Patau's syndrome, in which patient's rarely survive long, 18, producing Edward's syndrome, in which patients rarely survive childhood, and 21, causing Down's syndrome, and of  course the  sex chromosome, but that has the inactivation mechanism noted, and can produce a number of relatively benign syndromes, from a survival perspective.</p>
<p>It's really just up to chance which chromosomes happen to code for proteins that are lethal in large quantities.  The chromosomes are numbered in size order, so the smaller numbers have a higher chance of producing more proteins that in excess are incompatible with life.  Note that even in the &quot;non lethal&quot; trisomies, the lower the number the lower the lifespan.</p>
<p>An interesting note that illustrates this is that chromasome 21 is where the tau protein is coded for that is responsible for the plaques that cause alzheimers, so all downs syndrome patients will develop alzheimers at a young age if they survive long enough due to overproduction of this protein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, the extra DNA means more proteins get made that arent needed. This in turn causes the effects we see in people with down syndrome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mistake. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Our bodies are really good at producing sperm and egg cells so that we can produce healthy babies, but moms produce thousands of eggs and dads produce millions of sperm. Sometimes the cells in our bodies that divide in order to make those germ cells (sperm or eggs, which are special) get stuck and do it wrong, keeping two copies of chromosome 21 in one germ cell, and zero copies in the other. The germ cell with zero copies can't do everything that it needs to and will die before you even know you're pregnant (if that cell involved in fertilization). The germ cell with two copies will end up with three copies of chr21 if it's involved in fertilization and develops into an embryo. More isn't &quot;better&quot; in biology, you want just the right amount. So having more gene activity because of the extra chromosome confuses the developing embryo and it grows in different ways which produces a baby with downs syndrome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
