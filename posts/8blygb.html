		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no standard, it’s cultivated from years and years of different companies selling different products.</p>
<p>For example, if a mattress manufacturer’s 60x80” mattress (Queen) sells very well, the company that manufactures bed frames will want to sell frames that fit this size, as well as the company that sells sheets, comforters, etc. Concurrently, competitors also see this size selling well, so they will want to produce it themselves to capture some of that market.</p>
<p>That being said, there is still some variation in the market; one company’s King may measure 76x80” while the next company’s measures 78x80”.</p>
<p>I believe someone else in this thread pointed out the wiki page for bed sizes, you will see some variation between the popular sizes between different countries, all stemming from the above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pre WW2 most people slept on double beds and then manufacturers started trying to upsell  by selling them as &quot;for $1 more you can get an inch bigger bed&quot;. As the WW2 economic boom was happening people started buying larger beds for their homes and the manufacturers were making advertisements comparing the old smaller beds to cribs, so naturally people bought into it because people are easy to manipulate. As time went on the now popular bigger beds were selling, the best sellers mostly fell into 3-4 size categories which we now know as twin, full, queen, king (matress height is not standardized in any way). They aren't truly standardized, these just sold the best. Beds also grew as average human heights have, naturally taller people need bigger beds. There are also oddball sizes like Cal Kings, Alaskan Kings, Wyoming Kings, Eastern, twin xl, full xl etc. I believe in Europe double beds are still somewhat standard. I worked in a big name matress factory for 5 years and the marketing and mark up is insane. I will never buy a mattress at  retail price and I suggest the same for others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just a convention. You can find a lot of places that sell weirdly shaped mattresses, but it came to a point where people needed a mattress which fit their bed frame. In order to maximize compatibility, the industry decided upon certain standard sizes which would make it easier for the consumer to purchase a bed frame and a mattress separately. It just became a &quot;thing&quot; which everybody understood. A couple big bedding companies from 1941-1965 sold bed frames and mattresses separately but assigned them sizes. These sizes had exact measurements and soon other companies picked up on this convention. Nowadays you will find mattresses that fit your bed frame perfectly because of this convention. No mattress company wants to ruin their consumer experience by selling a mismatch mattress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no legal standards. However, there are standard imposed by simple economics. This is one of those cases. There is only a finite number  of companies that make equipment to make mattresses. Manufacturers have to buy that equipment, and the parts and pieces, to keep the mattresses rolling out the door. Otherwise the manufacturers would have to build their own machines. Ask yourself this “I want to make mattresses. Do i want to build the equipment from scratch or use the already available equipment to make mattresses?”. If it’s the former, well done, you’re the new myspace. If it’s the latter, then your choices are limited to the manufacturer specs (for the most part). Manufacturer specs are what they are for historical/economical/parts specs reasons. Hence we have standard sizes. Economics rules #sorrynotsorry</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's different for each mattress factory. They design their own beds or use designs given to them by the brands they may or may not chose to incorporate into their factory. Generally the larger the area where the mattress factory is then the more expensive the mattresses are going to be since the nearby factories will be using brands like Sealy or whatevers designs and possible even materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
