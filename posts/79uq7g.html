		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great responses. I will just add that in biochemistry terms, &quot;vitamin&quot; just means something that your body requires that it doesn't make itself, meaning you've got to get it from your diet.<br />
Edit: I am here referring to the types of dietary vitamins OP was asking about. Also note that vitamins are organic compounds, meaning they have carbon in them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First they identify something high in what they're trying to extract. Let's say they're trying to extract vitamin c so they get a bunch of oranges. Then they grind the oranges up and mix them into something called a solvent. The solvent chemically dissolves everything in the orange and separates it all. The mixture is then spun around super fast, this further separates them. When it settles the vitamin C will be in one of these layers and it'll be extracted separately. Then you'll have (relatively) pure vitamin C. </p>
<p>Edit: something something autocorrect</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamins are usually created in a manufacturing environment, like laboratory that has been scaled up so that the batches are much bigger. Many vitamins can be created by organic synthesis which is, essentially, mixing several components in a specific order under specific conditions (like 100 degrees Celsius for ~4 hours, etc.). They will take commercially available building blocks and combine them in huge reaction vessels and take samples at given time periods. These samples are tested using analytical techniques such as gas and liquid chromatography as well as mass spectrometry. They also test pH to make sure it is in the proper range and once everything is tested they will put the reaction mixture through a purification process. This can be employed using a wide variety of methods such as extraction, fractional distillation, centrifugation, etc. Samples are again tested to ensure that they conform to USP standards (generally 99.8% purity as there will always be some residual water). Once the ultra-pure vitamin is attained in a powdered form it is then mixed with a binding agent and filler such as starch, along with heat, and pressed into pill form (sometimes the doses are very small and that tiny amount of powder is mixed with filler so the pills aren't the size of flea turds).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in Pill Encapsulation. There is a machine that makes pills. One barrel holds a batch of liquid vitamins. There is a second barrel that holds heated liquid gelatin. The gelatin flows over two cooled drums, this makes the two side of the pill. </p>
<p>The medicine/vitamins flow to heated wedge. The wedge is placed over two dies, that contain the form of the pill. The two ribbons (the cooled gelatin) are fed through the dies, underneath the wedge. </p>
<p>The wedge squirts the medicine/vitamins just as the die comes together, and heats the gelatin to seal it. And out pop some pills.  </p>
