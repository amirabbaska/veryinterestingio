		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It creates a massive steam bubble, it doesn't last too long (not sure on actual time it is there for) but something interesting happens when the &quot;bubble&quot; is there. The gas makes the bubble expand until it reaches the maximum size it can as the pressure forcing the bubble to expand becomes weaker the water pressure causes the bubble to collapse on itself before expanding again (this can also result in a flash of light as the bubble collapses). This actually happens a few times, each time the &quot;bubble&quot; gets smaller in size until the energy is depleted. I will try to find a video explaining it as I may not have done a terribly good job of explaining it.</p>
<p>Edit: What I am talking about happens at the three min mark of this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/OubvTOHWTms" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/OubvTOHWTms</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: a more in depth video of the bubble side of things, <a href="https://youtu.be/cp5gdUHFGIQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/cp5gdUHFGIQ</a> starts explaining it at the 6 min mark.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of the word but the video reminded me, the bubble oscillates in the water. The size of the bubble would depend on the energy released by the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first lets start off with what happens for a conventional explosive. Ill choose gun powder since its simple and people come into contact with it on a regular basis. It is composed of a mixture of carbon sulfur potasium nitrogen and oxygen all of which is in a solid form. When lit it rapidly decomposes from its former structure into most notably carbon dioxide, molecular Nitrogen and lots of heat. These are gases thay are very hot and would create a bubble underwater. </p>
<p>For a nuclear bomb you start with uranium 235, a neutron comes along and attaches to u235 and makes u236 which is very unstable. u236 decays into several things differnt elements including Xenon gas plus Strontium and 2 neutrons. As Xenon is a gas it will form a bubble. How stable this bubble is im not sure, but since both gas and heat are produced a bubble will exist. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
