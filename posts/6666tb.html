		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consuming more energy alone is rarely a problem considering plants already only absorb a really small fraction of sun light that touches them.  If anything there's a massive energy surplus.  </p>
<p>What tends to be more of a problem are things like water consumption, nutrients pulled from the soil, the amount of fertilizer (and thus the amount of energy you need to use to make said fertilizer), pesticides used, and any biproducts the plant might make.  But those aren't necessarily linked to calorie count.</p>
<p>Edit: Should have differentiated between energy costs in terms of the energy the plant consumes and stores vs the energy cost to make things like fertilizers.  However the later part isn't linked to the actual amount of calories that the plant can store.   I kind of wrote things quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The environmental cost (or monetary cost) of food doesn't scale with the calorie content of the food. <a href="http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/09/the-surprisingly-big-carbon-shadow-cast-by-slender-asparagus/" target="_blank">Asparagus</a> costs about 6.5 times as much as avacado in CO2 equivalents per kilogram, and avacados have 8.5 times as many calories per kilogram.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions aren't the only environmental cost of food production, of course. Some foods like beef and palm oil contribute to habitat destruction that imperils many plant an animal species, on top of producing large amounts of CO2. Tropical fruits like bananas tend to have a big environmental impact both because they grow in sensitive habitats like rain forests, plus they have to be transported great distances to reach consumers. Cocoa isn't too bad environmentally, but it involves a lot of forced labor and below-subsistence wages. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the source of energy, really. </p>
<p>For protein from beef cattle, <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S/T2.expansion.html" target="_blank">the ratio of energy input to protein output is 40:1</a>. </p>
<p>&quot;This energy input is <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S.full" target="_blank">more than 11 times greater than that for grain protein production</a>, which is about 2.2 kcal of fossil energy input per 1 kcal of plant protein produced. This is for corn and assumes 9% protein in the corn.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously not everyone gets protein from corn, but &quot;Soybeans derive about 35 to 38 percent of their calories from protein compared to approximately 20 to 30 percent in other legumes&quot; <a href="http://www.soyconnection.com/soy-foods/nutritional-composition" target="_blank">Source</a>. </p>
<p>&quot;Grain-fed beef production takes 100,000 liters of water for every kilogram of food. Raising broiler chickens takes 3,500 liters of water to make a kilogram of meat. In comparison, soybean production uses 2,000 liters for kilogram of food produced; rice, 1,912; wheat, 900; and potatoes, 500 liters&quot; <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, an ingredient being high in calories doesn't in itself make it environmentally costly.  Calories from plants are pretty much manifested from sunlight and atmospheric gasses, which are free, and fertilizer, which is not too expensive.  You need 1500 or 2000 calories per day no matter what anyways.  </p>
<p>To understand the costs of a food you really need to consider each ingredient as the product of its own unique circumstances.  There is no perfect grand unifying rule-- it depends on what it is, how it's grown, and where it comes from.  </p>
<p>Just some examples:  A calorie of beef emits as much greenhouse gasses as 5 calories of potatoes.  A calorie of wheat costs more land than a calorie of corn, but corn grows on more productive land, might displace more biota and certainly costs more water.  Lamb emits more greenhouse gases than pork, but pigs suffer more.  A calorie of almond oil costs a bunch of California water and a calorie of palm oil costs rain forest.  In December, asparagus in Peru is tremendously less costly than asparagus in the USA.  Chicken emits less methane than grass-fed beef, but costs 10 times its calories in grains that could be used otherwise.</p>
<p>In general, meat is more costly than vegetables, which are more costly than pulses and grains.  Foods grown locally and nonperishables are less costly than food coming from afar and foods that need refrigeration.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be intimidating to research your staples.  Most of us don't really eat that many things as major food sources and there's lots of information out there.  Or just try to eat peasant fare-- hearty grains, pulses, and local vegetables for bulk calories with vegetables and meats thrown in more sparingly for pleasure and nutrition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we make the assumption that the calorie content in a food correlates with energy necessary for the food production (which is false, as just about all the previous commenters have shown), it wouldn't matter what food you ate. You still need ~2000 calories a day. Whether that comes from a bucket of broccoli or from sticks of butter, it's 2000 calories. Based on our original assumption, 1 cup of butter would cause way more damage than 1 cup of broccoli, due to the differences in calorie content, but the total damage would be the same.</p>
<p>But as I said, that's wrong, and it's actually really complicated. In general, you want local food and plant-based food. These two articles delve into the details:
