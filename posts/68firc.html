		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is difficult to answer the question when you juxtaposition it as humans vs animals &quot;such as ants&quot;.</p>
<p>A key reason most animals (including humans) strive to be better than one another has to do with the aspect of evolutionary theory known as sexual selection. Most animals will seek a mate that improves the likelihood of their offspring being successful. Part of that is seeking the genetic makeup that improves the offspring. Another part is selecting a mate that will be the best parent.</p>
<p>In some species the sexual selection is mainly done by one sex, which results in competition in the other sex. One example is birds of paradise. Other species the selection is done by both sexes, which leads to competition in both sexes. Humans fall into this category.</p>
<p>Ants is an entirely different story, because their genetics is based on haplodiploidy. The entire colony are the offspring of the queen, so there is no genetic variation. When she mates she mates with ants that carry only her dna, so there is no evolutionary benefit in mating with x, y or z.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different animals have different strategies. Remember that from an evolutionary point of view, all that matters is passing on your genes by any means. Workers ants are all infertile. They won't be passing on their genes anyway. So there wouldn't really have any been any pressure to develop internal competitive drives because that would actually compromise the chance of them the queen passing on her genes (and that is where all the worker ants get their genes from too)</p>
<p>Humans might be a social group animal, but there is still competition for resources between different members of the group and between different groups. An individual that manages to stand apart from the others and get higher status has more chance of passing on their genes, so that sort of behaviour got selected for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary perspective, it's because we want <em>our</em> genetic material to be passed down to future generations. Outshining other members of the species increases the chances of a mate picking you, and hence carrying on your genes. In the animal kingdom, you make yourself a more worthy partner by performing mating rituals, fighting off other suitors, etc. In the human world, we prove ourselves to be good potential mates by being smarter/richer/more successful.</p>
<p>From a more social perspective, the norm of competitiveness is embedded within our society - the more talented you prove yourself to be, the more likely you are to be accepted and provided with opportunities. </p>
<p>In comparison to ants, however, I'm not too sure. It may have something to do with their mating system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oohhh, can answer this! A major cause is the genetic makeup of ants (and also bees). It's because they're &quot;haplo-diploid&quot;. Basically, the males only have one copy of their genes, while the females (worker bees) have two copies of their genes, just like humans do. </p>
<p>When a human (or most other animals) has a baby, they are 50% related to it. This is caused by the way genes shuffle between parents when an egg fuses with sperm, but basically, you get half the genes from mom and half from dad. Each parent gives one of their two copies. It's a little more complex than that, but essentially, your offspring get half of your DNA. And not all of your kids get the same 50% as it shuffles each time. </p>
<p>So a daughter is 50% related to her mom (other half from dad) and 50% related to her own offspring (other half from her mate). However, remember how male bees and ants only have one copy? Well, this causes a special case where the dad ant or bee is 100% related to his offspring! He gives his entire copy to his kids, but the female bee only gives 50% of her genes; she only gives one of her two copies. This means that <strong>female ants and bees - workers and drones - are 75% related to each other!</strong> That's a 75% similarity between sisters, so <strong>sister ants are more related to their sisters than they are to the queen mother, or their own possible offspring!</strong></p>
<p>Well, what does that mean? Since ants are more closely related to their sisters than to their offspring (and I only mention the females because males aren't &quot;workers&quot;), their &quot;evolutionary fitness&quot; is stronger if they know their place and help their sisters live. If they tried to have babies, they'd be 50% related to their kids. But they're 75% related to their sisters, so their efforts are best spent keeping sisters thriving. And so long as the queen is the same, that will continue to be the case, since all the queen's kids will be more sisters. It's better to help your sisters and queen mum, since that's your best chance of having genes like yours stay alive and going. </p>
<p><strong><em>TLDR: because ants are more related to their siblings than they are to their own kids! SCIENCE!</em></strong></p>
<p>PS: This is why the death of a queen sends bees and ants into chaos. If the queen changes, her babies will be nothing like you. And if that happens, your devotion to the new queen is in vain. When a queen dies, the female ants go into a frenzy trying to become the new queen and save the maternal lineage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
