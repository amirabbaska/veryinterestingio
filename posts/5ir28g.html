		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason most of them can't hang from branches, run 40kilometers or open a can of beer with their fingers and drink it.</p>
<p>They are specialised to stay underwater and we are not. </p>
<p>There are a number of methods they use,</p>
<p>1Lowered metabolisms, sometimes only for the dive duration, cutting down of the blood flow to 'non essential' components. lowered heart rate etc.
Weddell Seats can go down to 4 heartbeats a minute.</p>
<p>2 increase of oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood, making their blood very viscous.</p>
<p>3 the ability to store large amounts of oxygen in their muscles as well, sometimes huge amounts more than 10 times what humans can hold.</p>
<p>4 Extreme efficiency in swimming and diving, their streamlined bodies take little effort to move through water and deep dives are more a matter of falling through the water than they are 'swimming' (Human deep divers do the same thing, using weights to fall).</p>
<p>They can also get the bends if theyre not careful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fact, the animals are only staying under water for a single breath, it's just that they can hold their breath for a lot longer than you or I can. Some whales (the sperm whale for example) can hold their breath for over an hour while it hunts for the giant squid.</p>
<p>Some animals, in particular marine mammals, have significantly more myoglobin in their muscle tissues. These tissues hold significant quantities of oxygen, making it available for metabolism as the animal holds its breath.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A German 'free diver' has apparently entered the Guinness World Records by holding his breath under water for more than 20 minutes. Tom Sietas, 35, competed with former record holder, Brazilian Ricardo Bahia, to set the new record by not inhaling for 22:22 minutes</p>
<p>we can be conditioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies from species to species, but most will have evolved a way to either retain more oxygen or use less oxygen.</p>
<p>Some use water pressure to help contract veins to increase oxygen absorption while others can regulate their temps or muscles to use less oxygen.</p>
<p>We can train ourselves to both physically and mentally increase our capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the more significant adaptations that marine mammals have is a higher concentration of myoglobin (as opposed to hemoglobin) in their bloodstream. Because myoglobin binds more aggressively to oxygen, it acts as a time-release for oxygen.</p>
<p>They can subsist on oxygen in the bloodstream far longer than we can.</p>
