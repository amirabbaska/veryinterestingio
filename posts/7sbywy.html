<p>Or, If when I go to eat my kale or whatever vegetables... I am actually eating more pollution than I would if I bought it from the store.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer to this is: yes, but &quot;am [I] actually eating more pollution than I would if I bought it from the store.&quot; is more complicated.</p>
<p>Three main types of pollution produced by cars are CO2, nitrous oxides and particulates. Plants use CO2 to grow, so to them it's not a pollutant. Nitrous oxides wouldn't accumulate in plants so you'd be at no more risk compared to standing by the road. It's the particulates that are much more of a concern since this is a catch all for all sorts of toxic compounds, but mainly complex hydrocarbons and heavy metals. These are <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593332208618280" target="_blank">deposited alongside roads</a> but the amount will depend on the amount of traffic and will decline the further you move away from the road. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26194234" target="_blank">&quot;Vegetables are the major source of human exposure to heavy metal and contribute about 90 % of the total metal intake&quot;</a> so growing veg in contaminated soil would not be a great idea. The complications come from how busy the road is, how close to it you are, and how polluted with heavy metals the soil your store-bought veg were grown in (sewage sludge is often applied to soils and contains heavy metals too). </p>
<p>edit: looking into this further I came across <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749112000929" target="_blank">this paper</a> which measured heavy metal concentrations in vegetables grown in Berlin. It was summarised <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/291na1_en.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. They found the amount of heavy metals varied substantially between sites and crop species, but they often contained higher levels than products from supermarkets. They advised leaving at least 10 m space between the road and the garden.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in grain research where we would plant rows of wheat with different varieties.  Year after year the rows near the highway were noticeably shorter.  Rotation crop of healthy and infected and hundreds and lines of crops over the years.  My conclusion was from ground compaction from traffic and a water diversion.  The ecosystem goes to the depth of the roots.  Consider less the pollution from cars in the air and more the way they change the soil.<br />
No peer review articles, No research. Just observation so take what you want form this.  Cheers and good luck.  I've always wanted a pumpkin patch out front.  But city bi-laws don't allow curb growing of anything but grass.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would be more concerned about the potential for lead in the soil if this has been a busy street for many decades. Gasoline used to be leaded and many older cities suffer from lead in the soil because of it. But lead does not accumulate equally throughout plants so you should look into what's safe in leaded soil. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once lived a few hundred feet from an 8 lane freeway, and everything outside was coated with a fine black dust, like soot. I assumed it was just particulate emissions from the cars and trucks. We didn’t even use the backyard. I didn’t want to sit in a patio chair and get my clothes all black, much less eat tomatoes covered in soot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd be more concerned about soil health than anything else. Vegetable's outsides can be washed, what gets inside is a bit harder.</p>
<p>I don't know the overall location, level of activity, and cleanliness it'd be in, but if it's less than 5 feet from the road I would probably be concerned as well.</p>
<p>I'd say either excavate and replace the soil in the area you're intending to use, or build a raised bed and mix cheap bagged soil into it. As for debris, like I said I'd less concerned, it can generally be washed off, but something like a barrier plant or simple fencing should be plenty - unless again, it's 5 feet from a freeway, then I likely wouldn't bother having a garden at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
