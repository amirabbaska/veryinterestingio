		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the defining moment in my Reddit career - the opportunity to set the record straight and give the definitive answer. Why did I get here so late? Private brand merchandising is a significant portion of my day to day job so I hope I can be helpful. Please excuse any errors, I'm on mobile.</p>
<p>First I think it's important to break things down into four distinct categories: Food/consumables private branding, general merchandise private branding, co-branding, and special make ups (SMUs).</p>
<p>Food and consumables (think OTC, health and wellness, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies) are in their own category since they typically follow a recipe. Cookies are the common example here. I could use Coke but I'd prefer to say cola and keep it generic. In the case of major national brands, the recipe has been standardized and reduced to a science. A retailer's private brand seeks to offer that standardized, reliable product at a discount. That discount is achieved by eliminating marketing expense. Store brand dish soap is 99.8% or more identical to Dawn or another national brand, but the retailer gets a deal because marketing costs are not rolled into the cost of the item. It is even possible that the packaging itself (materials, amount/number of ink pantones used) represents a chance for cost savings. In most cases the store brand seeks to meet or beat the national brand quality while providing better value to the customer and better margins to the retailer. In other cases, the retailer could have multiple private brands where there are quality concessions. This cadence allows for the retailer to capture multiple demographics. </p>
<p>For general merchandise, it's less likely that the national brand has complete control over manufacturing. Not always, but for the most part you can assume that an imported item comes from an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Very few American brands actually own their factories overseas. Some do, some might rent space and staff the factories, but most brands will simply contract with a factory to build an item to their specifications. The end result here is that multiple national brands are often made in the same building. There are entire multi-billion dollar industries that are supported by a network of 3-4 massive factories in China. In the case of private brands, a retailer here can cut out the national brand entirely and go straight to the Chinese factory. Whereas private brands are often a partnership with the national brand in food, general merchandise is an area where a retailer's private brand is in direct competition with the national brand. Example: The $50 name brand HDMI cable you bought from Best Buy was probably built in the same factory as the $10 Dynex cable. I've spent my entire career in hard goods. It's to the point where I can look at an item, regardless of the brand, and know which factory it came from. The overall goal stays the same as with food and consumables, but the road map here is different.</p>
<p>Co-branding is when a retailer has &quot;their private brand&quot; by &quot;national brand.&quot; Someone mentioned Kirkland Signature Dish Detergent by Cascade. Obviously you aren't saving much on marketing here since the retailer still gets the advantage of using the national brand's name. The goal here is to add legitimacy to the private brand by roping in the national brand. Maybe Costco was having a hard time convincing members to switch to Kirkland brand detergent, so they needed to associate themselves with Cascade in order to boost confidence.</p>
<p>Special make ups are like private versions of a national brand. The best example of SMUs are TVs. Walmart and Best Buy are shown an entirely different lineup of TVs by Samsung. Both retailers might have an item with identical features except for the number of HDMI inputs. This allows them to promote and discount their items independently without having a price war. SMUs are also one of the few areas where a retailer might lower the product spec or quantity in order to differentiate itself. This can be done simply by changing the pack size, concentration of an ingredient (marshmallows in Rocky Road ice cream, for example), substituting a material (lower quality steel in a kitchen knife), anything that allows the big box retailer to show a value over the typical item.</p>
<p>Feel free to PM if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Edit: Hijacking my own post just to say this. The next time you have a bad experience at a big box store, please remember that some of the people at corporate are Redditors just like you, with student loans, a mortgage, and two golden retrievers at home, who are just trying to do their best and get by. Nothing makes me happier than knowing I made a customer happy with a cool item that I found and brought to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They buy it from the brands. Every brand also sells under other names to make more money. It's basic yield management.</p>
<p>Basically I want to sell to as many people as possible but the economic price / demand curve teaches me that for price x, y amount of people will buy.</p>
<p>So if I want to sell more I got to have more than 1 price. I need to have as many prices as possible for the SAME PRODUCT without people getting wise to my little game. :D</p>
<p>So if my brand is &quot;Chocoly&quot; and that's my top price, I advertise under that name it's my eye level high margin product.</p>
<p>I sell 10 Chocoly cookies for 5$ </p>
<p>But my price of producing the Chocoly cookie is 5 cent per cookie and packaging is 20 cent so the box of Chocoly costs me 10 x 5 + 20 = 70 cents.</p>
<p>I got a lot of margin left even if I sell at 3$ per box right ? But I can't do that under the brand name &quot;Chocoly&quot; without canibalizing my sales to the people willing to pay 5$ per box. </p>
<p>So I make a deal with a grocery store to sell it under their own name, with a slightly different box design and cookie shape (maybe I just change the brand that's printed on top of the cookie, simple switch-out of the stamp. </p>
<p>Now I'm selling 1000 boxes at 5$ and 2000 boxes at 3$ each. I got to split my income on the 3$ boxes with the store but it's still more money in my pocket. And the people buying the 3$ box would never buy the 5$ box (too expensive) so I don't lose out my total sales are higher. Likewise the people buying the 5$ box don't want the 3$ box they want the good stuff... I've just doubled my money from the same cookie.  </p>
<p>The whole REASON behind it is this: we have a fixed production capacity. </p>
<p>Anytime the production capacity is fixed or slow to change we get yield management. </p>
<p>Airplanes - &gt; fixed number of seats : we change the prices over time to make sure it's full (last minute deals)
Hotels - &gt; same as airplanes, fixed number of rooms
Restaurants -&gt; daily specials, gotta use that sea bass</p>
<p>So in what sense do the cookies have a fixed production capacity ? Well any factory owner will tell you, if you can manufacture 5000 a day you must manufacture 5000 a day and figure out a way to sell it all for a profit. It's the only way factories can really make money. Because some costs are not going to go down, machines still age, employees still stay 8 hours a day and and the lights are still on and the rent is still due... etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most manufacturers are actually contracted by multiple companies to produce similar goods - they maintain a single assembly line for something like shoes, dresses, furniture, washing machines etc.. The workers in the factories receive specifications for each of the stations, and do the same simple task - applying a half dozen screws in 30 seconds, nailing a heel to shoe, attaching a plastic face plate - regardless of the product in question. Much of the customized work is from either automation that presses steel and plastic into pre-fabricated molds, or from templates that show exactly where someone cuts a piece of fabric, leather, leg for a chair, etc.. </p>
<p>Much of the &quot;fashionable&quot; work of goods, such as a name tag, designer face plate, or novel engineering feature such as more settings on a washer-dryer, will fit the same templates or molds, and when the same line of goods is sold to Target or Walmart, they'll simply skip the steps in the manufacturing line that adds those features. In the case of outer shape or color differences, the manufacturer will use left over stocks of last year's fabrics and prints, or less complex molds that can cast more copies of a plastic shell without losing the details that are on the higher end models.</p>
<p>In fashion in particular its not uncommon for Target or Walmart to contract with a middle tier design house (i.e. Martha Stewart brand, etc.) to copy particular features of last season fashion styles, which avoids paying licensing costs or royalties to expensive Parisan or New York fashion designers. The features might be the length of a dress, features of asymmetry, types of prints or patterns on fabric, etc.. After the top end design houses have finished production runs with factories, Target or Walmart will contract the same factories to run their knock off designs with cheaper fabrics using nearly identical templates, or less sophisticated prints that use fewer dyes. They'll also skip a lot of the quality control checks, or accept more defects per individual item to squeeze as much volume from a contracted order as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I worked at burtons foods ltd in Moreton, Wirral. We used to make most of Cadburys biscuits. *Fun fact, every single Cadbury chocolate finger that you ever ate came from there, up until the factory closed a few years back (6-7 years ago I think). Anyhow, after we did a full run of say Cadbury wafer bars then after the required amount was reached production was paused whilst they changed the packaging and labelling rolls over for say Aldi or Sainsbury's etc and then just carry on. Note; sometimes though not always the recipe was tweaked very slightly (more or less sugar, fat or whatever).
Also if the shipment was going to a different country other than UK say the US or the Middle East the recipe was changed a little for the same product from the same company due to that country having its own preference in tastes. So yes, the same product from two different countries CAN taste different even though they have came from the same factory and made, packaged and sold by the same company. Some may find this interesting, I did. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't actually make it.</p>
<p>Costco doesn't make &quot;Coscto Whisky&quot; Costco has a contract with (it's not but for ease of names) Jack Daniels. And again for ease I will use &quot;Bottles&quot; not &quot;Barrels&quot;</p>
<p>If Jack Daniels sells their whisky for $20 a bottle, say it costs them $10 to produce. Costco says &quot;We want to buy your whisky at $15 per bottle, but we will order 10,000 bottles. We're going to resell it as Costco Whisky&quot;</p>
<p>Jack Daniels says &quot;Sure thing, but here's an Non-Disclosure Agreement. You cannot tell anyone Costco Whisky is made by Jack Daniels.&quot;</p>
<p>Jack Daniels may only make $5 per bottle instead of 10 but they just sold 10,000 bottles. Costco paid $15/bottle, cost the $1/bottle to re-label it and they sell it at $18/bottle.</p>
<p>So it's cheaper to buy costco &amp; they still make money. They then do this with many other products.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
