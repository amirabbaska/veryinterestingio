		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>I've read that caffeine is more water-soluble than tannin. So short brewed tea has more free caffeine than long brewed. Long brewed has more caffeine in total but a lot of it has bond to tannin. Gastric acid is capable of splitting the bond so the caffeine will be bio available over a longer time span.</p>
<p>This morning I put pure citric acid in my tea and I noticed that the tea looks a lot clearer and much lighter than my normal long brewed tea.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the citric acid prevent the solution of tannin?</li>
<li>Can citric acid prevent the binding of caffeine to tannin in the first place?</li>
<li>How many slices of lemons would be needed to achieve that in a 200ml cup? -&gt; Cultural reason for lemons in tea?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your answers :)</p>

<p>[EDIT] after nearly 8k views (haha I love the internet) I decided to make a short timelapse, because many of the auto deleted comments didn't believe that the tea looks different with citric acid. of course I missed the sweet-spot with the acid but trust me I can't drink anymore tea today. I'm nervous AF and I've got heartburn.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, the citric acid only interacts with the tannins and not the caffeine.
In hard water areas the tannins oxidise to for what is known as tea scum. The addition of a slice of lemon disrupts this process so it no longer forms. This also affects the harshness of the stains formed on the surface of the cup.
Caffeine content is also affected by the type of tea used and the hardness of the water.
From what I know I don't think you can ever calculate the amounts of citric acid needed exactly as a tea brew contains far too many compounds to fully quantify it all.
Culturally in Britain lemon is put in tea like Earl Grey to enhance the flavour. It is not necessarily to change the caffeine content. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reducing the pH makes tannins less soluble because they are acidic. Lower pH means less deprotonation of the tannins making them less soluble in water. It would be very hard to quantify this without knowing levels of tannin (and tannin is an undefined mixture).</p>
<p>Ca2+ won't really oxidize tannins because you'd need a rather strong oxidizer for that which Ca2+ is not, but it can undergo interactions, possibly precipating out negatively charged tannin as was mentioned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
