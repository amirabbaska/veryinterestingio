		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last names were a method to distinguish between multiple people with the same name. They fall into several categories. </p>
<p>1) Occupational. Smith, Wright, Cooper, Fletcher, etc were all professions. So John the blacksmith eventually was shortened to John Smith. </p>
<p>2) Geographical. Names like Hill, Dale, etc are physical descriptions of locations. Hank from over on the Hill became Hank Hill. Some languages use the names of villages and cities as well. Any name in German that has &quot;van&quot; in it means someone from the city/village that follows. Similarly Spanish names with &quot;de&quot; in them mean the same thing. </p>
<p>3) Descriptive. Red, Black, Green, White, etc were names given to people referring to a physical characteristic that they had. Hair color, eye color, skin color, etc. There are also slightly more obscure names like longfellow that refer to height, and other similar descriptions. </p>
<p>4) Familial ties. Eric son of James became Eric Jameson. Irish names with &quot;Mc&quot; and Scottish names with &quot;Mac&quot; means &quot;son of&quot;. Irish names with &quot;O'-&quot; like O'Riley means &quot;grandson&quot; or &quot;descendant of&quot;.</p>
<p>5) Bestowed names. You also have names that were bestowed on someone by a religious figure or by a Monarch when they entered the ranks of nobility. The names that Monarchs take when they take the throne would also fall into this category. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some cultures though, especially in several tribes in my country, last name/surname doesn't indicate any inheritance or family. Usually, surnames are inherited from the father's or mother's surname (in matriarchal cultures).</p>
<p>For example, in Javanese culture, there's no such thing as surname, so Javanese people usually are mononymous (one word name). If they have more than one name, usually they're unrelated from their parents' name, so both the first name and last name are given. Although, some Muslim Javanese adopted Malay conventions of name giving (derived from Arab), which is 'given name' + 'bin'/'binti' (son of/daughter of, respectively) + 'name of father', kinda like Scandinavian naming conventions with their -son and -dottir.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A last name was originally more like a descriptive word. People attach a bit of information after your name when they talk about you, in order to better identify you. </p>
<p>I was speaking to Tom yesterday
Tom?
Tom, Peter's son</p>
<p>You could sell that to Tom
Tom?
Tom, the Miller</p>
<p>She got married to Tom
Tom?
Tom, from Santos</p>
<p>My guess would be that written history and language is what started to establish this as more of a hereditary surname. But it's only a guess. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to add to this. Blacksmiths were not the only smiths, and they didn't necessarily get the name 'Smith'.
Blacksmiths also got the name 'black ', and Brownsmiths got the name ' brown '. Silversmiths and goldsmiths and a host of other smiths probably got the same naming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just a way of clarifying that became convention. &quot;You know John? Yeah, he's Peter's son... John Peter's son = John Peterson.&quot;  &quot;If you want a really great cake, you should take to John the Baker.&quot; = &quot;John Baker.&quot;  &quot;I know guy who can reshoe your horse, John the Smith.&quot; = &quot;John Smith&quot;  or &quot;This is John from London&quot; becomes &quot;John London&quot; and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
