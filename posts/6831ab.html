<p>Then one of the elder officer tell her something like &quot;We've been stopping druglords in mexico for 50 years ... do you think it's a better place now ?&quot;</p>
<p>Which is kind of a rhetoric question, no it's not better, it's just as shitty, his point is to not waste her life trying to stop every drug crime going on, because whatever happens there are always people to rise up again</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the harm caused by drugs?</p>
<p>1)  People get addicted</p>
<p>2)  People do bad things while high, because their judgment is impaired; and</p>
<p>3)  People commit other crimes to finance getting high.</p>
<p>How is the criminalization of drugs contributing to the harm caused by drugs?</p>
<p>1)  By making it illegal we make it more difficult for people to access care services to get off drugs.  By making it illegal we punish people and make their lives actively worse (i.e. job loss, jail, social stigma) when they are most in need of help to quit and in the best position financially and socially to quit.  We thus keep people on drugs and make it harder to quit.</p>
<p>2)  By making it illegal we limit the options people have to enjoy drugs in a safe environment.  Imagine if you could only get drunk in a public park as opposed to at a bar or your home (and once again because of the punishments we apply to drug addiction many addicts cannot own a home due to job loss).</p>
<p>3)  By making it illegal we drive up the price.  This means that an addiction is extremely expensive when it could be extremely cheap.  There is no reason why, on a month's salary from McDonalds, you couldn't buy the equivalent of a million dollars in heroin at today's prices.  If we produced this shit at scale and more efficiently we could make the price basically zero and eliminate the need for people to commit crimes to be able to afford it.</p>
<p>What harm is caused by making drugs illegal?</p>
<p>1)  Huge financial expense to enforce drug laws.</p>
<p>2)  Criminal gang wars for control (see the mob wars and prohibition)</p>
<p>3)  Huge numbers of drug users in jail (also at a huge expense).</p>
<p>4) Huge amounts of money going into the hands of hardened criminals who finance corruption of politicians, murders, etc. </p>
<p>In short... it causes more harm to make it illegal and making it illegal increases the harm it causes, than simply letting it be legal.</p>
<p>Frankly I would have the government give out free drugs at government owned facilities.  Get your heroin, get a room for the night, and enjoy.  But before you get your fix, a nurse kindly looks at you and says &quot;Bubz, you sure you don't want to get clean?  I'll stay with you, set you up with a job, your own place...  Life can be a lot better than it is... if you want it.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit:  I stupidly forgot another catagory here...</p>
<p>What GOOD is done by drugs being illegal:</p>
<ol>
<li>We hope that we reduce the number of people who become addicts.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reasons prohibition was a failure - the War on Drugs makes an already dangerous situation much worse.</p>
<p>By making drugs illegal you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a black market with enormous financial incentives - this is why the war on drugs can never be won. There is an ENORMOUS demand, and by restricting the supply, all you do is drive up the price/profit margin - this means that there is a ton of easy money to be made, as long as you're willing to take the risk. Someone, somewhere, will always be willing to take that risk. </li>
<li>Cause most of the violence related to drugs - enormous profits mean people will go to extraordinary lengths to protect those profits - this is why people are willing to use violence to protect/increase their market share. Think of alcohol as one of these dangerous drugs (it's one of the very few addictions whose withdrawals alone can kill you) - when's the last time you saw violence between beer vendors?</li>
<li>Make it harder for people to get off drugs - you direct the money you could spend on treatment to police/prisons instead, which leads to the next point...</li>
<li>You lose an extraordinary amount of human capital - locking people up means they're not working. It also means that their family has lost a father/mother/brother and leads to children growing up without parents.</li>
<li>You actually cause a lot of the deaths with the more dangerous drugs - when it's illegal, there's no quality control. Consider heroin - heroin addicts very rarely die from an acute heroin overdose. They know exactly how much heroin they need to get their fix. What kills them is when a drug dealer spikes their batch with fentanyl (or other drugs more powerful than heroin) to make their batches last longer, or to get a reputation for a powerful product. It'd be like accidentally drinking 24oz of Everclear (95% alcohol by volume) when you thought you were just drinking a couple of beers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just think of it in the exact same terms as prohibition. It's a war that can't be won because of the enormous demand, and driving the market underground means that instead of reputable companies providing a consistent product, you've got gangbangers doing whatever they can to make a quick buck - including purposefully killing people to get a reputation of &quot;having the strongest stuff&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zanctmao" target="_blank">Zanctmao</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not my thoughts, but I copied this from a comment by <em>Frater Plotter</em> on an article by Prof. Johnathan Adler about federal drug policy that he posted on the  <a href="http://volokh.com/posts/1234812396.shtml" target="_blank">Volokh Conspiracy blog</a> (before it became part of WaPo) in 2009. I repost this comment from a stranger because I could not say it better myself:</p>
<p>The biggest problem with prohibition is that it is a straightforward infringement of liberty. What substances my neighbor chooses to put into his body is not my business. To borrow a phrase from Jefferson on religious freedom, &quot;it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.&quot; </p>
<p>However, as with many infringements of liberty, prohibition also creates social ills, which may be observed even by those who do not consider liberty an adequate inherent good. </p>
<p>First among these ills is the cost of enforcement. This includes the cost to taxpayers of policing drug production and use; the cost of trials; the cost of imprisonment or parole enforcement. These costs are substantial and are easily reckoned: consider that one-quarter of persons imprisoned in the United States were convicted solely of drug offenses (production, possession, or dealing). </p>
<p>A second social ill is the lost productivity of the imprisoned. This is an indirect consequence of enforcement. My present salary is in six figures; if I were to use illegal drugs and were convicted and imprisoned, I would lose that job, and the economy would lose my contribution. This ill does not end with the end of a prison term, as ex-cons are typically unable to find jobs that allow them to make as large a contribution as the un-convicted. </p>
<p>A third ill is the creation of a black market. The black market is outside of the legitimate economy and thus represents economic activity that is not taxed -- or, in many cases, recorded at all. If a man chooses to spend $50 on a quantity of marijuana or cocaine rather than of wine or tobacco, he creates a &quot;leak&quot; in the flow of money from the legitimate market to the black market. Money laundering and other forms of economic corruption are created to lift the leaked money back into the legitimate economy. Thus the black market corrupts the legitimate market. </p>
<p>A fourth ill is the creation of high-risk, high-reward economic opportunities in the black market. The more effective enforcement is at restricting the supply of illegal drugs, the higher the prices will go -- and thus, the higher the reward for successful drug production, smuggling, and dealing. Larger risks can only be absorbed by truly desperate individuals (who turn to drug crime in the perceived absence of alternatives) or by increasingly large and well-defended operations: drug gangs. Thus, prohibition ends up financing the creation of large-scale criminal operations: organized crime. </p>
<p>The consequences of organized crime are many, including violence; but one of them deserves special notice as a fifth social ill of prohibition: once there is organized crime with a revenue stream, the corruption of enforcement authorities becomes a necessity. Broadly, organized crime cannot exist for a substantial length of time without the consent of the cops: either by abandoning their duties (letting the gangs &quot;own&quot; a neighborhood because it's too dangerous to patrol) or by explicit corruption (being bought off). In some cases -- even in one small, quaint Massachusetts town where I used to live -- the police become an active part of the black market, moving and dealing illegal drugs. </p>
<p>(It's worth noting that many people lay the blame for some of these ills upon drugs rather than drug prohibition. However, recreational and addictive drugs which are not illegal do not create these ills: the owners of liquor stores and bars do not engage in shootouts, nor do they generally need to buy off the cops -- except, of course, in places where a scarcity of liquor licenses is used as a means of extortion.) </p>
<p>A sixth ill is the degradation of other rights to make enforcement easier. This includes the weakening of the rights to be secure from search and seizure, the increase of police violence, as well as the degradation of the right to freedom of speech and of the press. (For the latter, see the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, which forbids the publication of information relating to the manufacture of a controlled substance.) </p>
<p>A common rebuttal is that some of these social ills would follow from the prohibition of anything, even of acts that are themselves violations of rights. (For instance, organized crime can exist amongst thieves as well as amongst drug-smugglers.) </p>
<p>This is, to an extent, true. However, the cost of many of these ills depends on the prevalence and profitability of the crime in question: and illegal drugs are vastly more profitable than theft. It is reasonable to say that the social cost of theft would vastly exceed the cost of &quot;theft prohibition&quot; -- so prohibition is a good bargain. The cost of drug prohibition, however, vastly exceeds the cost of drug use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
