		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antitrust lawyer here.</p>
<p>For one, we're talking about different antitrust issues. Broadly speaking, the antitrust laws prohibit (1) concerted action that harms competition, like price fixing cartels; (2) unilateral action by a monopolist that harms competition; and (3) mergers and acquisitions that significantly diminish competition.</p>
<p>Microsoft was alleged to have used its position as a monopolist to undermine competition. That's (2) above. Typically, monopolization entails an element of foulplay. Achieving or maintaining a monopoly through normal, reasonable business practices is not illegal.</p>
<p>Comcast and TWC are proposing to merge. That's (3) above. When evaluating a merger, the DOJ looks at whether the companies directly compete in any markets, and whether the merger is likely to reduce competition in those markets.</p>
<p>Comcast and TWC claim that they do not directly compete. That's true, but there's more to the story. Comcast and TWC will point out that cable systems are &quot;natural monopolies&quot; -- it costs a lot to lay cable, and where one company has already laid cable in a given area, it enjoys a huge cost advantage over other would-be competitors, who would have to lay their own cable to compete.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, Comcast and its rivals have also done some dubious stuff in the past that has led to the current competitive landscape. For example, Comcast, TWC, and others have engaged in a number of anticompetitive deals, such as geographic market allocation and customer swapping, to create large regional monopolies. These deals themselves arguably violate the antitrust laws -- see (1) above -- and indeed are the subject of ongoing litigation. But unfortunately, the DOJ most likely would not take this background into account when evaluating the likely effect of the merger on competition.</p>
<p>So when Comcast and TWC say that the merger will not reduce competition because they do not currently compete, that is in part due to the fact that they have already <em>agreed not to compete</em>. It's like two members of a price fixing cartel saying that merging would not reduce competition because, hey, they aren't competing anyway.</p>
<p>We don't know yet whether the DOJ will challenge the merger. The Obama DOJ has been decent in this area; they challenged the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger and US Air/American Airlines merger. But neither of those cases played out -- the FCC killed AT&amp;T/T-Mobile, and the DOJ caved once politicians began pressuring the agency to let US Air/American Airlines go through.</p>
<p>Given that Comcast is so well connected in Washington, and in light of the potential difficulties in establishing that the merger will actually reduce competition, I expect that the DOJ will approve the Comcast/TWC merger, subject to certain concessions.</p>
<p>Politics is a core issue when it comes to antitrust enforcement. In fact, I don't think the Obama DOJ would sue Microsoft today. Clinton's DOJ was a bit more aggressive in this area.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad was one of the anti-trust attorneys who represented the government in the Microsoft case, and is now representing the US government in the Comcast/TWC merger so I have some intimate knowledge of both cases. In the case of Time Warner/TWC, they can argue that since they don't compete with each other in a lot of markets, they aren't consolidating their market shares. It's a flimsy argument, but they have near-infinite legal resources and the government doesn't, so the reality is, if the government tries to stop the merger from happening, they will fail. Same as Microsoft, the outcome was very favorable for Microsoft because they had the DoJ enormously out-lawyered. What they're trying to do instead, is negotiate terms of the merger that will be most favorable to the consumer. It's exactly the same thing as the American Airlines/US Airways merger. They will have to agree to not raise their prices more than X% per year for Y years in markets where they would effectively have a monopoly, and other consumer-friendly regulations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US Government <em>did</em> have trouble prosecuting Microsoft.  They investigated repeatedly throughout the 90's, but they only got a slap on the wrist by the European Union and nothing more than a finger waving by the US DoJ... if anti-trust laws still had any teeth they would have been split into a couple companies (OS, Office, etc).</p>
<p>The issue with Comcast/TWC is that they're effectively operating as a cartel (by not competing with each other now), and it's a discussion about how much future competition the merger actually prevents.</p>
<p>We should be discussing nationalizing broadband infrastructure, but I digress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While /u/Ah_Q's answer is very good, the bottom line is this: corruption.</p>
<p>The spirit of antitrust law is to protect consumer choice, and improve consumer quality of life through that choice (quality of life meaning better goods &amp; services at lower prices - really, what the foundation of capitalism and our entire economic paradigm is built on).</p>
<p>A merger between Comcast/TWC does not benefit consumers, at all. There is no case to be made that it does, because it doesn't. Thus there is only one way in which the merger will be approved, and that's through corrupted political channels*, including outright bribery as defined by the average, every day normal people that our government is supposed to serve.</p>
<p>Lawyers and politicians can fuzz the language and legal technicality all they want, but the end result is the same: citizens get fucked.</p>
<p>*Or perhaps our government is beyond corruption at this stage. Corruption implies a government body favoring special interests in exchange for favors. But perhaps our government is favoring special interests, period. No favors involved, they simply don't even care about their purpose as lawmakers anymore. They aren't standing on &quot;our&quot; side of the fence and taking bribes through the links, they are standing squarely on the other side of the fence now with their backs turned to us...</p>
<p>Bribing a congressman now is more akin to just preaching to the choir, making water wet, or attempting to kill that which has no life...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
