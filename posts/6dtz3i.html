		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an idealised case no. In reality there will be small differences due to things which aren't really mentioned in your question.</p>
<p>For instance if you drive into a wall at 100mph the fact that your wheels are spinning (for example) makes the situation different from if the wall is launched towards the car at 100mph. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're in outer space, then there is no difference. But here on the ground there's a huge difference. In case #1 you'll hit the wall, rebound a bit, and come to rest with respect to the Earth. You might crack the wall a little, but for the most part, you won't affect it much.</p>
<p>In case #2, though, the wall will continue to drag you across the ground until you both come to rest.</p>
<p>It is the introduction of the Earth into the problem that creates a huge asymmetry. (And that means event #2 will get far more views on Youtube.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not seeing any replies that are addressing friction to the ground - which would be a huge effect. Concrete walls are so notorious because they don't move and that's because they are usually embedded into the earth via foundations. Cars have limit grip on the other hand.    Any attempt to throw a wall at a car will likely be less dramatic as the car will quickly move and no object will have any serious grip on the ground at that time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are moving 100 mph and hit a flat plane which instantly decelerates you to 0mph, the technical effects of that are exactly the same as if you were moving 0mph and a flat plane instantly accelerated you to 100mph. If you add real world stuff it gets more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here already so I'll just add a small difference: the wall will push a cushion of air ahead of it that will reduce the impact marginally. If you hit the wall your smaller area and shape means less of an air cushion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
