		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically they use a bunch of methods to estimate what the temps must have been like. They measure ocean sediment composition, ice core samples, pollen samples, tree rings, fossilized leaves etc. </p>
<p>Ocean sediments contain different levels of oxygen and different isotopes of oxygen (for example when there is more of a heavier oxygen isotope present it generally means a warmer climate).</p>
<p>Different layers of ice cores have different chemical compositions (including oxygen isotopes), which helps piece together what gases were in the atmospshere, and ultimately the temperatures.</p>
<p>The pollen, tree rings, and leaves contain indicators on how the plants did (how well they survived) at certain times/years which would be due to the different climates/weather conditions, including temperature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many organisms in the ocean make their bodies out of a chemical containing oxygen(air). They get this oxygen from the water around them like how fish can breathe underwater. There are two types of oxygen atoms in the ocean (one is slightly heavier) and the ratio of these oxygen atoms in the ocean is dependant on the temperature of those oceans. Warmer oceans have more heavy oxygens than cooler ones, so animals living in warmer waters make their bodies with heavier oxygens.</p>
<p>When those animals die their bodies rest on the sea floor and over millions of years turn to rock, still containing that oxygen. Scientists can measure the amount of heavy oxygen in those old rocks and compare it to the ratio of oxygens in our current oceans to estimate the temperature of the oceans millions of years ago.</p>
<p>If there are more heavy oxygens in the rock than in the oceans today, the oceans used to be warmer. If there are less heavy oxygens, the oceans used to be cooler.</p>
<p>(I'm sorry if that was confusing but it's difficult to talk about without getting into the Chemistry, feel free to ask in more detail and I'll try to clarify)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An other way is scientists go to the Antarctica, dig a hole in to the ice and checking the ingredients (mostly how much type of air was at that time) of the huge tube they got of the ice. The deeper you digged the more you looking in to the past. Those ingredients change from time to time and by knowing how the ice and their ingredients looked when it was cold and how it looked when it was warm they can guess the temperatures of other years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know how certain things react to changes in temperature, like ice. It'll have different characteristics depending on the temperature. So we can find ice from that time, and figure out what the temperature must have been. It's called a proxy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
