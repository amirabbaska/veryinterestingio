		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The files are carefully controlled to prevent that happening, and it is identifiable where and who such a leaked file would have come from. Someone working on the film isn't likely to have access to the entire thing, just the part they work on. Generally speaking people don't want to ruin their lives by breaking their contracts, destroying their careers, and being sued into oblivion just to give people a free movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even when special screening copies of films are given, they contain not only visual watermarking on them that often can be tracked back to who it was given to (those folks don’t want to get in trouble) but they also contain hidden tiny watermarking that could be 1 frame at a special spot in the film and only the company that prepared it knows exactly where to look for it.  You wouldn’t ever be able to find it but once leaked the company can download it and determine who is to be held accountable.   Due to this I think leaks are less common than say 10-15 years ago when people simply blurred the larger visible watermarks/identifying information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a place where we had access to in production version. There are multiple layers of security, the physical film reels are in a temperature controlled vault where very few people have access to. And all the newer films are in digital form in huge storage array. While we can access them, including work in progress version that hasn't completed production. There are multiple layers of security, we work on computers that have all USB ports locked down so you can't plug in a USB drive. We had to VNC into a separate virtual machine to do our work. Also these original film files are huge. Transferring them anywhere out of the ordinary will probably raise a lot of warning in IT. If you try to re-encode them on the spot before transferring, it will create a strangely high amount of CPU usage which probably is being monitored as well. There are machines designed for transcoding that can do it really quick, but those machine also log everything they process, who ordered it, where it's going, etc.</p>
<p>Lastly we all have to sign agreement before taking the job that if we leaked company property, we can be sued for lost profit, which will probably be some amount I can never even get close to repay in my lifetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
