They did not dilly dally, they did the lunar insertion burn from below the belts in Earth orbit and hauled butt through them. They also angled the trajectory intentionally to miss the worst of the belts on the way to the Moon.</p>
<p>Even so there are accounts of the astronauts being able to close their eyes and see &quot;sparkles&quot; as charged particles zapped through their retinas while they were going through the belts. Which is kind of spooky to think about. Luckily the Earth is inherently slightly radioactive and the body can cope with a certain level of radiation dosage over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brauenig.us used to have an incredibly detailed explanation of this, but for some reason it's unavailable.  As others have said &quot;quickly&quot;.  Also, remember that they're &quot;belts&quot;, as in torus shaped or donuts.  Space lets you travel in all 3 dimensions easily, so they went around the worst parts.  <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b65e2e0545e0b7cf6c24caec348945d8" target="_blank">Here's a diagram of their trajectory with the intensity of the belts.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They just went through them.  The radiation levels in the Van Allen belts aren't generally intense enough to cause immediate harm to a human.  It's probably not an area you'd want to hang out in, but the Apollo spacecraft passed through the belts in less than an hour on their way out to the moon, and avoided the areas of highest intensity through careful flight planning.  The radiation doses received by astronauts were well within safe limits.  The Van Allen belts are more of a hazard to satellites that pass through them. Being exposed on every orbit leads to accumulated damage that can significantly reduce the lifetime of a satellite.  Satellites that need to pass through the belts generally try to use orbits that avoid the most intense regions of radiation and minimize exposure time as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
