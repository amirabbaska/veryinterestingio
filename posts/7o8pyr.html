		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to see something with a light microscope, you need to have a very, very thin cross-section. It has to be thin enough for light to be able to pass through it (for the most part). Otherwise, the image under the microscope would appear opaque or black. </p>
<p>But a small cross section means that there's not really that much material and/or pigment to add color to the light.</p>
<p>Look at a drop of water or a very shallow puddle of water on a white background. Not very much color is there? But look at the ocean from space. All that water is a rich, deep blue. </p>
<p>It's the same with a microscope. A carrot may look deep orange with the naked eye, but when you slice a thin enough piece off to see it under a microscope, it's a very pale orange if any color can be <a href="http://foodective.com/img/assets/1216carrot02.jpg" target="_blank">seen at all</a>.</p>
<p>If you're talking about images from an electron microscope, then an EM doesn't really see color. An EM uses electron beams and their reflection off of things for a computer to render a 3D image of what something looks like. It's like a blind person examining an object with his hands. Sure he can tell you precisely what shape and texture the object is, but he has no clue what color it is. An EM is the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking about a light microscope then the answer is that the colours don't disappear when you zoom in. If you search google images for &quot;chloroplast&quot; (that's the part of plant cells which makes leaves green) you'll find lots of images down microscopes of plant cells with little green blobs in.</p>
<p>The name &quot;<strong>chrom</strong>osome&quot; is called that because they were made visible by staining the cell with a dye which primarily gave colour to the DNA, not other parts of the cell - staining is an important technique in microscopy.</p>
<p>But a lot of colourful stuff is not as colourful as you think - suppose a substance absorbs 1% of light per millimetre as it passes through, but 2% of blue light. If you have a one millimetre-thick slice it will look almost completely transparent, right? 1 or 2% is nothing. But if you have a centimetre of the substance it will be passing 13% of blue light and 37% of other light, making it appear decidedly yellowish.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things going on as well. Light microscopes can operate using <em>phase contrast</em>. Normally you just let light pass through or bounce off whatever you're sampling, this technique uses how much the light has slowed down on its path to the eye or camera - this is used on very transparent objects and doesn't give you colour information.</p>
<p>Others have pointed out that electron microscopes don't show colour - they see with electrons not photons, and electrons don't have colour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most colors do not disappear until ye reach the scale o' an atom or so. At that size (which no normal microscope can see), objects are as small as a light wave, so color doesn't work right.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a blind person reading braille. She is limited by the density of nerves in her fingertips to make out individual letters and resolve them correctly.</p>
<p>As they get smaller and smaller, she can feel “something”, but the dots are too close together relative to the nerves in her fingertips: it’s impossible to resolve the fine differences between letters.</p>
<p>That can be solved by increasing the scale of the letters and having her feel them when magnified, which is why light microscopes are useful But…</p>
<p>…suppose the letters are so fine that the <em>actual structure of the paper</em> is too coarse to hold the individual bumps and shapes in the first place. Each letter will be a rough blob, with some hint at its proper shape. Increase the scale of this, and you get big blobs.</p>
<p>Our blind Braille reader might get a rough idea of what she’s feeling, but at some scale the individual letters will be blotted out and it just becomes “bumpy” or “not bumpy”.</p>
<p>That translates to “dark” and “light” in this analogy, where the identity of individual letters are the colors. They are lost at high magnification because the apparent distance of a light wave (~500nm) of the object is blown up to 500,000nm in the eyepiece — that’s half a millimeter, which is small but visible with the naked eye.</p>
<p>But, you won’t be able to distinguish fine differences of color, because, much like the physical properties of the paper, at this scale these differences are hard to resolve by visible light alone.</p>
<p>Sorry if that was a bit rambling — like I said, it’s a hard ELI5 (which means I probably don’t understand the subject as well as I should). Take it for what it’s worth :3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
