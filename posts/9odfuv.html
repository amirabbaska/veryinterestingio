		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automatic transmissions have a fluid coupling between the engine and transmission that allows the engine to run at low RPM without transmitting much torque to the transmission.  Imagine a propeller spinning, making the fluid spin, then the fluid makes another propeller spin.  </p>
<p>Manual transmissions disengage the clutch so there's no connection between the engine and transmission when you push the clutch pedal in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a Automatic transmission car think of the link between the engine and the transmission as a desk fan pointing at another desk fan.  The one fan is powered as it is connected to the engine.  The other fan is connected to the wheels and spins because of the airflow from the powered fan BUT you can easily stop it if you want. </p>
<p>In a car the Torque Converter is these two fans and it uses a fluid between them instead of air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's either in neutral or park, or it's in gear with the clutch engaged (manual) or the torque converter engaged (automatic). In this state, there's nothing loading up the engine so it can spin freely. If you kept the brakes on and pulled the clutch out on a manual car, the engine would stall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In traditional manual transmissions, failing to apply the clutch pedal (and ideally shift the gearbox into neutral) as you come to a stop, will indeed stop the engine. You can put this down as an example of a &quot;stupid driver error.&quot; This also arguably works as a safety feature in case the driver becomes unconscious. </p>
<p>Moreover, there's typically a safety interlock switch that won't allow the starter to work except when the clutch is pressed. This is to prevent damage to the starter or transmission. </p>
<p>The clutch functions to couple or uncouple the engine output shaft to the wheels, and allows the engine to rotate freely at idle or if you're shifting.</p>
<p>In general,  you should place the x-mission in neutral when idling at a stop. Otherwise this tends to cause wear on the clutch plates.</p>
<p>Automatic transmissions tend to have a fluid coupling and an automatic clutch between the engine output and  the x-mission.The fluid coupling still transmits some torque to the x-mission when the clutch is unlocked. On the other hand, the clutch bypasses the coupling and creates a hard connection between the engine, the x-mission, and the wheels. The clutch is disengaged whenever the transmission control performs a gear shift.</p>
<p>Tbis makes shifting much smoother and makes it not necessary to get of the gas when you shift, unlike a manual. Also, in idle this torque is fairly low. Modern ATs are electronically controlled, and are programmed to unlock the clutch at idle as well as during shifting.</p>
<p>Because of the fluid coupling, this allows the engine to still rotate even when the wheels are stopped. This produces a low torque on the wheels which is why cars with AT's will tend to creep forward when the brake is released. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
