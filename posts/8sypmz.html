<p>Humans prefer hot meals because we've evolved to. What separates us from primates and other animals isn't opposable thumbs, it's the ability to cook our food. Cooking our food specifically meat, allows us to eat and digest it much quicker. Seriously, think how long it would take to eat a steak if it were raw. Chicken. Any type of meat, really. Scientists (antro? paleo?) believe that this is what allowed humans to evolve with much bigger brains: because we learned a trick to spend less time cooking, prepping AND eating food, while maximizing our nutritional gain with every meal. </p>
<p>As for cold/hot water, this is kind of a personal/cultural preference. Americans generally preferred iced/cold drinks with meals. Many Asians prefer tea with meals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s entirely cultural. I’ve taken guests from China out to eat, and they couldn’t have the cold water because they found it ‘too cold’ to have together with the hot meal. They’re used to having hot soup with their meals. When I was in Japan, most meals you get with a serving of hot miso soup. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was living in China, almost every restaurant would give you a cup of hot water as you sat down at your table, particularly in Winter. So I'd say that drinking only cold water is more of a cultural thing (seeing as it's perfectly normal to drink hot water in the west so long as there's a tea bag in the cup).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe hot meals originate from our earliest ancestors whom learned to wield and create fire. Cooking hunted/scavenged meat actually helps &quot;denature&quot; proteins (which is really just a fancy word for stretching or relaxing their naturally coiled structure). This in turn makes it easier to break down the proteins in our stomach and small intestines and in turn allows us to absorb more nutrients from the food which we then use to build our own proteins among other things. </p>
<p>This extra nutrients was then used to fuel the caloric intake of our brains allowing for higher thought processes... you could say cooking food likely helped humanity reach its full intellectual potential and meant we required less overall food than eating it raw. </p>
<p>Cooking food also has the benefit of killing most germs, bacteria, and parasites which our ancestors wouldn't have known about exactly but may have noticed that cooking and drying meats and vegetables mean't they lasted significantly longer than leaving the food out raw which also mean't our food supplies were that much more stable and healthy.</p>
<p>So you could say a hot meal is more or less a universal norm because it had so many benefits for early mankind. </p>
<p>A cold glass of water is purely an American trend as in the UK and in particular Asia most drink hot tea with their meals. In Arabic cultures as well cold drinks are believed to &quot;shock&quot; the bodies core temperature throwing its natural heating rhythm out of wack. While warm or hot drinks are considered soothing to the body. </p>
<p>Medically the above to my knowledge is bullshit, but it does point out that different cultures like different temperatures of drinks... i also imagine that Cold drinks are a fairly new invention as several hundred years ago the idea of having ice in much of the world was more or less unheard of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
