		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For example, Denver is about the same latitude as New York City, and is a mile in elevation - yet it actually has warmer average high temperatures during winter. Northern Missouri has colder winters than parts of Montana, despite a 7-8 degree latitude difference. </p>
<p>It applies to Canada too. Edmonton and Calgary have very cold winters, but compared to the subarctic moonscapes of northern Ontario and Quebec they're practically equatorial.</p>
<p>I understand why the west coast is warmer than the east coast - due to the prevailing wind direction, the Pacific moderates coastal temperatures much more than the Atlantic does. What puzzles me is why inland locales in the West tend to be much warmer than eastern locales at comparable altitudes and latitudes.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple factors in any given year, but the fundamental reason is that the west coast has its prevailing winds (not all winds, all the time but the tendency) from the ocean (which holds heat quite well through winter). It is a west coast maritime climate, similar to western Europe). The east coast gets its prevailing winds from the same direction, but after travelling 3,000 miles over land - and land loses its heat in winter much faster than oceans do. It is an east coast continental climate. Think Korea/ Japan as a comparison. So <em>on average</em> winters in the west are warmer because of warmer water. In the east they are colder because of cold land.</p>
<p>That is what climate is, in essence: the annual average of weather, governed by where the winds take rain.</p>
<p>Incidentally, when the east coast gets east winds the storms are WAY fiercer for the same reason: warm water. Hello Harvey, hello Irma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The jet stream is a river of fast moving sure and it curves over the continent.    It can bring very warm air from the tropics to the West coast.  Then it goes up to the Arctic and comes back down on the east coast/mid West with very cold weather</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You allude to the big answer which is that places which receive most of their weather from land have 'terrestrial' climates which are both hotter and colder than when one's predominant weather comes from the ocean.</p>
<p>More specifically, however, is the effect of mountains in the west, particularly the Rockies. In middle latitudes, most weather is going to come from the west, with variations between the south-west and the north-west.</p>
<p>The western mountains of North America disrupt this westerly flow allowing weather from the south and north to play a stronger part. This produces a lot of weather effects such as a particularly large number of tornadoes and the generally colder winter temperatures for those in from the Dakotas to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Denver is close enough to the mountains that they don't get hit by this much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to point out that Calgary has very tolerable winters due to Chinook winds that also happen in Denver. Air warms as it passes down the eastern side of the Rockies then blows warms air through the city. There can be temperature changes of 20 degrees celsius overnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
