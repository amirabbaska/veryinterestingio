		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many great points about overbuilding and simulations have been made. But I’ll give an example from Disneyland. </p>
<p>On Space Mountain, a train needs to dispatch every 15 seconds to maintain proper separation. Because of varying weights, DAX (the dual computers tracking movement) use boosters and retarders to speed up or slow down sleds. </p>
<p>Right after you leave the station, notice that you immediately stop. This is so the system weighs you to determine what the system needs to do to get you in the right place at the right time. </p>
<p>As a bonus fact, if it detects that the weight will cause a potential break zone overrun, you get diverted to the left to the maintenance bay instead of climbing the lift hill on your right. This prevents the ride from e-stopping and keeps everything running smoothly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the heavy one will go a little faster, but only because the aerodynamic drag is less when compared to the mass. The acceleration of gravity stays the same regardless.</p>
<p>In any case the engineers will design around the biggest people they can fit in the ride, then apply a safety factor on top of that, because the forces on the structure as the car goes around a corner do increase with mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If possible something should be designed so that weakpoints are easily inspected and repaired. Even under neglect a well designed machine ought to fail as gracefully as practicable.</p>
<p>If you can not afford for something to go wrong, build it like God himself is attempting to make it fail in the most spectacular manner conceiveable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a load factor applied to the live load that one manufacturer calls their overburden factor. If I recall right they were using 160lbs for the average weight of every passenger and then 200lbs for the overburden weight. They basically run their simulation with all passengers at the average and all passengers at the overburden and then design for worst case. I’m not sure how their codes work because they’re all overseas but in the US, that would get another 1.6 factor applied to it so you have a ton of safety cushion, not to mention the statistical odds that every single passenger is over 200 lbs simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
