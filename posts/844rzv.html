		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cost.  Upgrading software is expensive.  If an upgraded licence costs $50 that may not seem like much, but doing that for 5,000 machines gets really expensive really quickly.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compatibility.  Very often, companies will have custom or specialized software that may not function well with newer software.  If the older software doesn't have patches/upgrades, or those patches/upgrades are not cost effective (see point 1) you may need to keep other software downgraded in order to preserve compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security/Reliabilty.  Older software - particularly in the enterprise - can be more secure and/or stable because the bugs and security holes have been patched.  Newer software may introduce newer bugs that can compromise operations.</p>
</li>
<li>Usability.  Not everyone is computer literate in a company and upgrading their software may confuse them to the point where they struggle to do their job until they learn the new software.  </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually it boils down to the cost.</p>
<p>The cost of upgrading canned software like MS Office, SQL, or Exchange can be astronomical. Even $150 x 500 machines gets very expensive very quickly, and that doesn't include the labor.</p>
<p>Companies also often have highly customized software like ERP systems or applications built in house that aren't compatible with newer OS's and they aren't willing to spent the time, effort and money to upgrade it.</p>
<p>The government in particular are notorious for this. They often don't have the resources to perform an upgrade because they either contracted out the software development in the first place and that company is out of business. Or the people that worked on it quit / were laid off / retired / don't have the prerequisite skill set.</p>
<p>So more often than not they sit on the problem until it becomes insurmountable and only then do they make an effort to upgrade.</p>
<p>All too often companies are willing to make an upfront investment to develop a system to suit their needs without any real understanding of what will be involved in maintaining it moving forward. Next thing you know they lay off all the developers to save costs... The application is working after all, why do we still need devs?</p>
<p>The reality is the cost of IT upgrades don't go away because you ignore them, they accumulate. So more often than not it costs more to upgrade long after the fact then having just done it in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
