I'd like to know at what age do male Bornean and Sumatran Orangutans grow their facial flanges/cheek pads? And once the pads have started growing, how long does it take until it's fully grown? I'm also unclear whether or not all males grow them or just dominant males. Thanks.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most mysterious things about the Orangutan.  We really don't know much.  The Orangutan is of the slowest maturing mammals - 7 to 10 years to reach reproduction age for males, and about 5 years for females - however, most male Orangutans don't mate before about 15 years of age.  Our knowledge on when the flanges start developing is unknown.  Our understanding is they start growing once its convenient for them socially.  Once the development starts, it will take about a year for the flange to fully grow in.  This flange also comes with muscles around the throat, longer hair, and a musty odor.  Once one male develops his flanges, it is unknown why other males suppress their flange development.  It is unknown how this suppression takes place, but we speculate that it might be through hormones.  There have also been studies that show that the presence of a fully flanged male does inhibit the growth of other Orangutans' flanges, but not indefinitely.  There are some scientists who believe that instead of hormones suppressing the growth of the flanges, it could be stress.  The testosterone levels of both flanged and non-flanged orangutans are the same so that crosses the thought that testosterone could cause it.  <strong>BUT</strong>!!!  There is one difference.  And that is the level of oestrogen in the urine of flanged males which breed; it is significantly lower than those who don't.  Some believe that flanged males who are aggressive to other flanged males create social stress, in turn causing the less dominant flanged males to produce oestrogen and be turned away from mating.</p>
<p><em>TL:DR - No one really knows anything about the weird mystery that is the flange</em></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I kinda went off on a tangent about Orangutans.  I get excited.  They develop them once their body starts maturing and they start becoming of age for reproduction.  But that can take anywhere between 7-15 years.  It takes about a year to fully develop.  Scary big flanged Orangutans usually suppress other orangutans into not growing flanges.  Even bigger scarier flanged Orangutans supress big scary flanged orangutans into not mating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your flanges will grow when it's the right time for you, not all orangutans develop at the same speed and that's not a bad thing :) try not to let the other orangutans get you down bro, you'll be the jungle V.I.P soon enough</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a primatology class in college and was told that there are two types of male orangs. The flanged males are big dominate guys and they will fight over females with other males to gain dominance and the right to mate. The unflanged males are sneaky bastards. They chose not to waste energy fighting other males for territory and instead they tend to sneak into flanged males dominated territories and rape females. While sad, it has been shown that rape is definitely part of orang society and some anthropologists have controversially used this behavior to try to prove that rape is actually a natural and normal occurrence in humans. Controversial stuff for sure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
