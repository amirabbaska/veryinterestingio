		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The master key itself is nothing special, the trick is in the locks set up to accept the master key. Most locks have a set of metal bars called pins, that prevent the lock from turning. A regular key pushes these pins to a precise height, moving them out of the way and allowing the lock to turn. Locks set up for a master key have two sets of these pins on top of each other. One set is properly aligned when the normal key is inserted, the other set is properly aligned when the master key is inserted. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Master-keyed systems have locks that are specially set up to accept more than one key. You can actually even set up multi-tiered systems, for example, with a &quot;grand master&quot; key that opens every door in the system, then a &quot;sub-master&quot; key for each individual building, and then &quot;change&quot; keys for each individual lock.</p>
<p>There are some great diagrams of pin and tumbler locks on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock" target="_blank">pin tumbler lock Wikipedia page</a>. Basically: a normal lock has two &quot;pins&quot; in each stack. The key moves the pins up just the right amount such that all of the &quot;shear points&quot; - where one pin ends and the next begins - line up at the right place.</p>
<p>In a master-key system, at least one position has at least one small, extra pin (sometimes these are called &quot;master wafers&quot;, because they are so thin, and because they are only used for master-keyed systems) between the two normal pins. This means that there are two different shear points for that pin stack, and therefore two different keys that can make all the shear points line up. To create a master-key system, you make a ton of locks with unique keys, but also add master wafers of the correct size to allow the lock to be opened by both its own unique key, and by the chosen master key.</p>
<p>This can be done by anyone who buys re-keyable cylinders and all the right sizes of pins for their chosen lock, you can keep track of everything in a notebook and assemble a master-keyed system yourself. However, the professionals have computer systems that can track and manage all the details of a key system, including multiple levels of master keys and other stuff.</p>
<p>This does add some vulnerabilities to the system. For example, you might imagine that it's easier to pick a lock that is designed to be opened by multiple keys, and it's true. But, if you have access to one key and one lock in your system, and a small supply of key blanks, <a href="http://www.crypto.com/papers/mk.pdf" target="_blank">it's possible to create a master key</a>. In some systems, if you have access to a large number of normal keys, it's possible to discover the master key without ever trying a key in a lock because of some constraints that master-keying places on a system. (This is also discussed somewhat in the paper - look for &quot;TPP&quot; and &quot;MACS&quot;, the sections that introduce those explain the limitations that we exploit.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the master key question has been answered, I thought it might be worth mentioning a type of key called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_\(lock\)#Control_key" target="_blank">control key</a>. In some cases the control key also operates as a master key. This type of key allows the user to easily remove the cylinder from the lock onsite for quick re-keying.</p>
<p>And when a lock picker <a href="https://youtu.be/dMQRaOiP6PM" target="_blank">picks to control</a>, it's quite an accomplishment among those interested in such things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A master key is just a normal  key cut to a specific cut then the locks have all been pinned so that when either the master key or the actual key that lock is inserted it pushes the pins up above the shear line and the lock will now turn. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another kind of master key system that hasn't been mentioned...</p>
<p>if the master key lifts 8 pins, the locks would only have 5. Keys for a specific lock would only have 5. Those keys match the master but only in 5 positions. ie: the gaps inbetween the pins will vary.</p>
<p>So all your locks are 5 pins, but those pins are aligned in 8 possible positions.</p>
<pre><code>12345678

or
12345678

but the master key matches all
12345678
