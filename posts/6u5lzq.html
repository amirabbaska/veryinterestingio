		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just spent at least 10 minutes undoing several screws using the end of a butter knife that was already in the same room, rather than go upstairs and get a proper screw driver for the job that would have made the job a lot easier and quicker. But it would have meant going upstairs to get the screwdriver. Why did my brain feel like it was more effort to go and get the screwdriver than it was to spend 3 or 4 times longer using an inefficient tool instead?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested in this book:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman. Kahneman has done Nobel-award winning research into the way human beings make irrational decisions and why. The TL;DR is that the brain has two distinct systems for thinking -- a strong, fast, emotional and relatively dumb one, and a weaker, slower, rational, much smarter one. When you &quot;think with your gut&quot; you're using the first system, and when you ponder something carefully and make a rational choice you're using the second system.  </p>
<p>So what you had here was a good example of the two systems being in conflict.  The dumber but stronger emotional system probably said something like &quot;Ugh, I don't want to walk up those stairs! I can do this with a butter knife.&quot;  The smarter but weaker rational system then pointed out that this was pretty dumb, but it wasn't strong enough to override the &quot;fast&quot; system, which is all about short-term tactics, not long-term strategies. The slow system then sent you off to Reddit to complain about how your fast system is an idiot.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amongst what everybody else has been saying, if you have spent the majority of your life making decisions based in favor of low effort, instant gratification as opposed to higher effort delayed gratification, then youve been reinforcing that behavior every time you accomplish a task that way. </p>
<p>Example: get home and cook a nice, healthy, cheaper dinner? No! Chinese takeout and netflix is faster and more satisfying, at least right now. Leads to a higher likelihood of doing that again. Remember how great that was, eating awesome food and binging strabger things? Of course you do. Lets do it again next week. Or tomorrow. Diet is actually one of the greatest ways to illustrate this idea. Eating healthy takes more commitment and conscientious effort. In terms of survival, you could have mcdonalds right now and be reinforcing instant gratification. But should you? No, because your body comes first. Or it should. Making this decision more frequent in your life reinforces your tolerance to delayed gratification. Realisation of the rewards that come with that, and then the preference thereof, is something you have to condition yourself to. The rewards in this scenario would be lower body fat, healthier cholesterol, overall hapliness with your own body. Etc.</p>
<p>Being successful in things comes down to the habits required within those things. For fat loss and fitness, its saying no to foods you dont need to survive. If you dont need it, dont eat it.
Money is the same way. You could buy that game on steam. Or you could also throw that $10 into your savings and play one of the games you bought last steam sale and havent even touched. One sounds great now, the other sounds like crazy talk. But if you do that each time, you could have enough to buy that game the next time around and still also afford something that improves your overall lifestyle, rather than further cement you into where you are currently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your example fits totally into the Escalation of commitment.  </p>
<p>Basically, you start something and by the time you realize your method is the wrong one, you think it would be a waste to have invested x amount of time to finally give up and try another method, so you double down on your initial method and the reasoning loops until you either finish your task or the remaining tasks end up looking numerous and/or complicated enough to force you to reconsider your method.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment</a></p>
<p>Edit: Like /u/hpdefaults explained pretty accurately, the escalation of commitment merely refers to the human behavior while the sunk cost fallacy refers to the flawed logic used to justify it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is wired to save you calories. This was an evolutionary advantage for the majority of human history, when food was scarce.</p>
<p>Sitting for 15 minutes unscrewing 3 screws with a butter knife is more calorie-efficient than making a laborious trek up and down some stairs so you can unscrew those same screws in 2 minutes.</p>
<p>It's the same reason humans are hardwired to be lazy - your body wants you to &quot;waste&quot; as few calories as possible. Unless you are doing something productive to gain calories, your body wants you to avoid unnecessary movement and energy waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I think is neat is that what makes us, humans, unique from any other animal is the ability to actually  conceive and plan for long term convenience.  The ability to use this cortical, higher level of thinking, process comes down to being a choice, being conscious, aware. Yet, the older, archaic part of our brains, the limbic system (sub cortical) has such a strong grasp on us.  It relies on doing what's emotionally most pleasing. That leads to more impulsive, animalistic short term behavior rather than purposeful, conscious behavior.  Relying on these primal instincts, really, IMO, is what laziness is haha. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
