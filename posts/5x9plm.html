		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see why the uncertainty principle would limit this situation from happening. The scale is too large. I did not read the question as either particle being absolutely fixed at one precise coordinate in space the whole time. Yeah, that would not be physical. Rather I read that the situation starts with initial separation of ~1 meter.</p>
<p>There would initially be a coulombic attraction proportional to the inverse distance between them squared. After a certain point the electron would be trapped to an orbital of the proton in a standing deBroglie matter wave forming a hydrogen atom. The Schroedinger equation has near zero probability of the electron falling into the proton. The potential energy of such a situation would decrease (nature loves that) however the total energy would (always!) remain constant so the momentum of the electron increases the energies balance into orbitals.</p>
<p>Sometimes however the proton does grab an electron. This is rather rare, but does have a probability. In this instance the proton and electron collide and form a neutron and a neutrino.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people are missing the <em>intent</em> of this question. Let's not take it so literally, but consider the idea of what would happen to an electron and proton in &quot;relatively neutral conditions&quot;, where they are close to a standstill. I think that's the point of the question here. Let's say they are one meter apart with minimal momentum, or possibly a minimal momentum in the same (parallel) direction if that helps (to see if the particles attract each other, and if so how quickly). </p>
<p>So... what would happen if you had a proton and electron <em>approximately</em> one meter apart with a <em>minimal</em> or nearly negligible momentum in the same parallel direction? </p>
<p>Thoughts? Answers? </p>
<p>Will the weak attraction be sufficient to alter any probabilistic vectors? If so, how quickly? And why is the likelihood of the pair forming a hydrogen atom? Low I imagine....?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This situation is not strictly possible due to Heisenberg uncertainty. You can solve the problem classically.</p>
<p>Quantum-mechanically, you'd have to loosen up the restrictions. They can't both be stationary <em>and</em> localized at a fixed distance initially. You can fix them at some distance, in which case they have a superposition of many momenta, or you can have them move towards each other with fixed momentum but no definite position. Or anything in between, as long as the HUP is satisfied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact experiment would be impossible to carry out because of uncertainty, but you could get pretty close. In that case the system would approach a bound system with the excess energy radiated away as photons. How it gets there is where it gets interesting as there are a bunch of different routes to get from your initial condition to the final state. Additionally, in some sense it actually takes all possible routes that couple those two states. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
