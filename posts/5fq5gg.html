		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't see the correct answer, so...</p>
<p>It is one feature of 'connected speech' in the English language. When a word that ends with a vowel sound is followed by another with a vowel sound, the speaker has to indicate to the listener that one word has finished, and another is starting - for example:</p>
<p>See Amy.  To show one word finishes and another starts, we input another phoneme between the words - see y Amy. The same is happening with the letters - B finishes with a vowel sound, and A starts with a vowel sound - so we separate them.</p>
<p>Other examples, random word combinations:</p>
<p>three ears = three y ears</p>
<p>knee operation = knee y operation</p>
<p>see it = see y it</p>
<p>completely empty = completelii y empty</p>
<p>Other vowel sounds can also take on a /w/ sound to separate 2 words. It just depends on where the tongue is located when the first word finishes, at the top or bottom of the mouth.</p>
<p>go away = go w away</p>
<p>who is it = who w is it (shout outs to Mantronix)</p>
<p>two animals = two w animals</p>
<p>There are also some nice rules to take into consideration when connecting words that start and finish with consonants, or if words that finish with a consonant are followed by words that start with a vowel.</p>

<p>edit #1 will respond to questions later or tomorrow, currently having a film night with my wife</p>
<p>edit #2 shameless plug for my blog, it isn't profit driven, although vocab based - might start doing more pron stuff now :) <a href="http://ieltsonline.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://ieltsonline.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>edit #3 first post, got gold - thanks, wherever you are :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, you and most people tend to use certain sorts of stress patterns on syllables you say.  In normal language, most words already have inherent stress patterns that trump everything else.  But when you just start repeating monosyllables over and over, your brain tends to default to patterns you see in music.*</p>
<p>some common musical stress patterns:</p>
<p>2/4 is basically strong/weak - repeat</p>
<p>4/4 is strong/weak/medium/weak - repeat</p>
<p>When you start repeating two monosyllable sounds, you just naturally fall into the 2/4 strong/weak pattern.  You say it <strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b and so on</p>
<p>If you say the string ABCD over and over you'll find yourself tending to do a 4/4 pattern of <strong>A</strong>bCd<strong>A</strong>bCd instead.</p>
<p>Repeating ABC tends to make you do a less common 3/4 time signature of strong/weak/weak.  <strong>A</strong>bc<strong>A</strong>bc.  It feels a little weird to do that since there's not a lot of music that 3-fold.  Same with ABCDE - it's 5/4 time and feels really weird.</p>
<p>Once you go to larger sets, you tend to just break it down into smaller patterns of 2/4, 4/4 and 3/4/  E.g.: ABCDEF tends to just become repeats of 3/4 time.  <strong>A</strong>bc<strong>D</strong>ef<strong>A</strong>bc<strong>D</strong>ef</p>
<p>But to get back to ABABABABAB, you're going to stress the first syllable and subsequent even ones and destress the odd ones.   <strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b<strong>A</strong>b</p>
<p>Therefore BABABABABABABA is going to have the opposite set of syllable stresses assigned to each letter, making it sound different.  <strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a</p>
<p>If you recut the latter to start on A, it doesn't change the particular letter you are stressing so it's just: a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>a<strong>B</strong>  It's going to sound the same as BABABABA even though you started the playback on a different letter.</p>

<p>*
So this would be interesting to test with someone from a different culture.  2/4 and 4/4 music are something that are very common in Western/pop music.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is something inherent to the human brain or just something we've been trained to do because almost all pop music does this.  </p>
<p>It would be very interesting to go to some fairly isolated culture that doesn't listen to pop music and has very different rhythm patterns in their music.  Would they pronounce something like ABABABABABAB differently than we would?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>English is a stress-time language meaning that rhythm and emphasis (what you might refer to as dynamics or volume) are very important in pronunciation. This would be an example of word stress within a phrase. </p>
<p>For example try &quot;strip out&quot; and &quot;outstrip&quot;. No matter where you start a recording of the two phrases, they will always sound different as the second word/syllable of a pair is stressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's the emphasis you put on each &quot;word&quot; (even though they are single letters). You are so used to emphasis &quot;going down&quot; at the end of a sentence, you will automatically say the B differently than the A.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try this:</p>
<p>Concentrate on keeping an even vocal pitch for both letters.  Don't ascend or descend at the beginning or end of either.</p>
<p>You'll soon lose track of which has the emphasis, because in English, a descending pitch is used to indicate the end of a statement phrase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
