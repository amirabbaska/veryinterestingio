<p>How does the Taliban (or ISIS, al-qaeda, etc.) justify these attacks? Why do their followers tolerate these attacks?</p>
<p>And outside ethics, how do these attacks even play into a rational military strategy??</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The larger context right now is being ignored. Since June the Pakistani military has been conducting a military offensive in the (former) Northwest Frontier Provinces (Now KPP). This area which now has an area called the FATA district is home to various Pakistani Taliban groups and tribal groups ( like the Mehsuds and Wazirs) with shifting allegiances. The Pakistani Taliban is influenced by A) Deobandi Islamism which is a South Asian variation of  Islam that has been radicalized by Saudi money and interpretation:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deobandi" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deobandi</a>
B) and its dominant influence is the Pashtun tribal ethos of Pashtunwali:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtunwali" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtunwali</a></p>
<p>These two influences have shaped Taliban religious and political ideology. Now, 80 % of the Taliban are Pashtuns, while Pakistan is divided into various ethnic and regional groups ( like Sindhs, Punjabis)..The Pashtuns are also in Afghanistan as the Durrand Line ( the border between Pakistan/Afghanistan) cuts between their ethnic &quot; homeland&quot;. They don't identify with the state of Pakistan. Now, since the operation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Zarb-e-Azb" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Zarb-e-Azb</a> was launche,  ( the breakdown of the ceasefire with the Taliban with PM Nawaz Sharif's gov't, and the Jinnah int'l airport attack in June),   The Taliban consider the use of attacks on children and schools as a means of exacting revenge which is a major important thing in Pashtun culture. They see the deaths of their tribesmen as something that justifies these barbaric attacks. They have been scattered now into various cities in Pakistan as well, which makes it more dangerous. The Pakistani Taliban are at war with the government in Islamabad. I would also like to add that the Taliban attacked an ARMY school, which means these kids were children of soldiers who were fighting in the NWFP or/and the school represented the Army. The tribes the Taliban protect there lost many children to the Pakistani military. This is cold blooded revenge for the Taliban at the same time sending a message to the Pakistani military to stay out of &quot; their&quot; territory.  </p>
<p>Edit: I am also going to add a Wiki link to the areas where the Pashtun people predominate. If you notice its in the area of the border region: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people#mediaviewer/File:Pashtun_Language_Location_Map.svg" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people#mediaviewer/File:Pashtun_Language_Location_Map.svg</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: Wow.Thanks for the gold! I am only doing my duty as someone with a History degree. If you want some good sources I suggest two readings:</p>
<p><a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300178845" target="_blank">http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300178845</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/01/pakistan-hard-country-anatol-lieven-review" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/01/pakistan-hard-country-anatol-lieven-review</a></p>
<p>Edit 3: I wanted to clarify that my statements are not demeaning to Pashtun culture or to Pashtun people. I hope you don't take offense. Most Pashtun are not Taliban. My point being was that most Taliban are Pashtun. I want to explain the socioeconomic and historical circumstances of a great people within the context of why the Taliban continue to exert influence. </p>
<p>Edit 4: wow this really blew up. I edited some things I said were wrong, so thanks for the input from fellow Redditors (SP?) I never expected so much gold for an explanation. Please no more! Instead, go support an independent bookstore and buy yourself a good non-fiction book. I implore you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing a lot of responses on here that aren't as detailed as I would hope. Here's my own personal understanding:</p>
<p>I can't speak personally to Afghanistan/Pakistan as I am not as well versed in the particulars of the area as I would like to be, but I can speak to this phenomenon in general and as experienced by an exceedingly similar place and time, that being Iraq during the U.S. Occupation (specifically during the years of 2006-2007).</p>
<p>The current conflict consuming Iraq is directly descendent from the happenings of this period. During this time, IS/ISIS/ISIL/&quot;Daesh&quot; was known as Al Qaeda in Iraq (&quot;AQI&quot;). While many/most Westerners remember the entirety of the Iraqi War as being a blur of bad news, during 2006-2007 the war was particularly horrific.</p>
<p>The former leader of AQI was a man named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian terrorist who personally beheaded an American named Nick Berg in an early rendition of the macabre viral video genre that has recently become vogue again for islamic extremists. In 2006-2007, there was a massive uptick in the number of bombings of civilian targets in Iraq. While it is easy to, as mentioned above, describe this as purely random acts of evil, they (AQI) had very particular and specific goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To delegitimize the newly-installed democratic government of Iraq by forcing regular Iraqis to believe their government could not adequately protect them. This, in turn, would reduce the level of popular support for the government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To create a chaotic atmosphere and reduce the ability of civil infrastructure from adequately providing for the needs of ordinary Iraqis. Why chaotic? As the last year or so of the Syrian civil war has rather clearly demonstrated, terrorist groups thrive in chaos.</p>
<ul>
<li>This tactic wasn't as simple as bombing random government targets, it was even finer grained. I recall reading (and I can provide a citation if requested) that AQI was planning to begin attacking garbage collectors -- the idea being making garbage collectors afraid to show up to work, thus resulting in garbage piling up, thus making the populace frustrated with the government and reducing popular support</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To spur on and (hopefully) ignite a sectarian civil war between the Sunni minority and Shi'ite majority of Iraq. AQI pursued this goal by consistently attacking Shi'ite targets, such as when they bombed the famed &quot;Golden Dome&quot; Mosque, the most important site in Shi'ite Islam, <strong>not just once (2006), but twice (2007)</strong>. Why would AQI want such a result? </p>
<ul>
<li>The most basic reason is because they knew full well what the response would be: Shi'ite Muslims extremists would feel the need to enact vengeance and thus begin their own campaign of terror on the Sunni community in Iraq. <strong>This, in turn, would force the fence-sitting Sunni Muslims to turn to the only force of resistance: Al Qaeda</strong>. And by and large, this plan worked as intended: enduring daily bombings that were taking dozens of lives a day, the Shi'ite community began forming their own 'death squads' which would randomly target random, innocent Sunni civilians, torture them, execute them, and leave their bodies on the streets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other posters were correct about one thing, though: <strong>AQI could not / would not challenge the US military or Iraqi military in a conventional war</strong>, because they full well knew they couldn't take them head on. Instead, they decided to use classic guerrilla warfare hit-and-run tactics. Eventually, they reasoned, they would chip away at the popular support enjoyed by the Iraqi government so much as to enable them to for, their own state, and indeed that was their plan all along.</p>
<p>One thing that gets lost in all this is that <strong>the idea of the 'Islamic State' is not at all recent concept.</strong> I remember years ago when I first began to read in-depth about Al Qaeda and <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/manualpart1_1.pdf" target="_blank">found a document that has come to be known as the 'Manchester Manual'</a>. This is an internal Al Qaeda strategy guide found in 1998 in Manchester, England, within a raided Al Qaeda safe house.</p>
<p>The very first page of the document lays out the long term strategy of the group: to (re)establish 'the Caliphate', and the general strategy for how it will be established:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and cooperative councils. They are established as they always have been:</p>
<p>by pen and gun</p>
<p>by word and bullet</p>
<p>by tongue and teeth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend to anyone interested in this subject material to give the whole document a read (it's not terribly long but it lends a valuable insight into the mechanisms behind how groups like Al Qaeda operate).</p>
<hr />
<p>In short, the idea behind a campaign of terroristic violence is not simply to inspire 'terror' in the civilian populace at large, they are specifically and carefully crafted to chip away at the popular support of the de jure government to craft a space for (in the Islamic extremist case) a de facto Islamic government to form.</p>
<p>The most important aspect behind these terrible and monstrous acts like the slaughter of the children as occurred with these poor children in Pakistan is create a chaotic atmosphere, where, again, these terrorist groups thrive. If a ruling government can be effectively forced to <em>not</em> govern, a power vacuum appears and (not to be cliche) as is known well nature abhors a vacuum. What group will fill the vacuum? The one that has already been organizing behind the scenes and has no hesitation to use the utmost violence and brutality to achieve their goals.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a last note, it's important to think about something important, a fundamental question that most people don't ever even consider: <em>what exactly is a nation-state, anyway?</em></p>
<p>There's obviously not one simple answer, but Max Weber (I think it was, at least) put forward an answer that changed my own perception (paraphrasing here): <em>a nation-state is an entity which holds a monopoly on violence over a given territory and the population within</em>.</p>
<p>In this sense, IS/ISIS/ISIL/&quot;Daesh&quot;'s characteristic brutality starts to make more sense, as despicable and horrific as they are. Their goal is to be so terribly more willing to use violence to achieve their goals so as to frighten potential rivals from challenging them, and thus achieve de facto nation-state status over the swath of territory they recently overtook in north-eastern Syria and Anbar province in Western Iraq.</p>
<hr />
<p>So anyway, that's a short(ish) summary of my own personal understanding. I don't claim to be some sort of incredibly well-versed authority on the matter, but having read many related books and trying to consistently keep up with the current events, it represents my overall understanding of <em>why</em> terrorist groups are so willing to use such unsavory tactics as <em>murdering hundreds of children in cold blood</em> to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>In the short term, it makes no sense. The general strategy, however, is with a long term focus on destabilizing the status quo to enable their own groups and their own ideology to fill a resulting void.</p>
<p>If anyone else has anything to add or any criticisms, or just wants citations for anything I missed, please let me know. I'm always eager to learn more or help others trying to do the same.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in further reading, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ay4Npzr.jpg" target="_blank">here's my Al Qaeda book collection</a> (unfortunately I'm on my iPad and my lunch break, so I can't type them all out). In particular, I recommend <em>The Longest War</em> (a lengthy and detailed synopsis of the 'war on terror'), <em>How to Break a Terrorist</em> (about interrogating suspected terrorists), <em>Kill or Capture</em> (same theme), and <em>The Black Banners</em> (by a well known FBI agent who interrogated dozens of Al Qaeda suspects stretching back to the USS Cole bombing and through post-9/11).</p>
<p>And if you want to read very interesting something from the other side, there's a guy who went by the Kunya 'Abu Jandal' who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for years before 9/11, was with him on 9/11, and was in Tora Bora when the U.S. began attacking immediately after. He's living in Yemen and is still wanted by the U.S. I apologize for not having the name of his book off-hand, but maybe someone else could locate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me explain less of the politics and more of the social aspect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why are Pashtuns so fond of wars?</p>
<p>The answer is location. The pashtun belt gives you access to the sub-continent. Pashtuns have been invaded by Alexander 330 BC, Persians, Romans, Arabs, Mongols, Turks, Mughals, Britain, Russia &amp; US. The mindset of never giving up your land and to band with other Pashtuns to resist against invasions was developed by history. Let’s go to the Cold War, Russia attacks, US gives weapons to the Pashtuns through Pakistan and encouraged them to “defend their brethren” (Watch Tom Hanks; Charlie Wilson’s War). The cold war ended in Afghanistan. That’s one aspect of this whole Drama.</p>
<p>Pashtuns proved to be a good friend to have on your side. Saudi Arab channeled money to teach their version of extreme religion to poor kids in Pakistan. The schools were called Madrassas, and among teaching many good things, they thought a radicalized version of the religion to the kids who were too poor to afford regular schooling. The madrassas were free and kept children off the street. The most dangerous ideology was intolerance towards other religions and other sects of Islam. When I was in school my own syllabus consisted of Muslims at war against infidels and Pakistan at war against India. So my friend here blaming the Pashtun culture fails to realize that the radicalization didn’t happen overnight and had nothing to do with the culture. All these terrorists you see today are a result of those years of brainwashing that was encouraged by the government and Saudi Arab for decades. The only difference is that at the time it worked for their cause. The madrassa kids had a lot of hate and faith. That turned them into the selfless fighters that everyone wanted. The point I am trying to prove here is that, it was a power play, not cultural values that caused the situation we are in now.</p>
<p>My cousin goes to the same school. The school has a very high tuition and is therefore reserved for kids from families that are well off. It is also a school for military kids. The name of the school is Army Public School. Now imagine those kids growing up in the madrassas. They have an innate hatred towards what they would call “These spoiled kids from rich military families”. They are not as sensitive towards these children as they would be towards children of their social standing. And yes I agree that the financial difference is not the only cause. But that in addition to the political motivations and the “70 virgins in heaven” ideology of the extreme religion makes them act in a less humanly fashion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It often starts with &quot;You kill our children, we kill yours.&quot; That's why we in the west should be a hell of a lot more careful about killing civilians. Every time a drone kills a child, we're creating a dozen wanna-be terrorists who are more likely to attack civilians rather than military and political targets.</p>
<p>Also, it can be a sign of desperation. If you can't successfully kill the enemy soldiers, or their leaders, then you go after &quot;soft targets&quot;. There are few targets softer than kids.</p>
<p>Another motive is to spread fear and terror. (That's why they're called terrorists!) But that often backfires. Unless the terrorists can completely take over an area, and rule it through fear, it means that very few people will <em>really</em> support them. They might comply to avoid punishment, but they won't put their neck on the line to save the terrorists. If they can inform against them, they will.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in Iraq: once the anti-American resistance started blowing up markets, their support plummeted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
