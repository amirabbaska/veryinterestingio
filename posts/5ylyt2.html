		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, you have the deep web and you have the dark web. The deep web are those sites that aren't indexed by search engines. You can't get to them unless you know exactly what you're looking for. The vast majority of the deep web are old servers and such that are completely useless. There are some gems, however.</p>
<p>The dark web is part of the deep web. It refers to servers that you can only get into with special software or special network configurations. Some of them are curated in large networks like TOR, but others are very small and private. These are the types of places where drug and human trafficking tend to go down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright so you have the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. The surface web is the internet you're most familiar with and is classified as anything that can be found with a typical search engine. The deep web is basically shit like medical records, legal records, government databases, and the like. Then you have the dark web which I'm guessing is what you're interested in.
All the illicit shit you hear about is what the dark web consists of. Drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, hitmen, kiddie porn, snuff films, etc. - they're typically all .onion sites from what I've seen. And they're all encrypted sites so it's not just a matter of typing in buyblackmarketshit.onion. The site addresses look like gibberish and end in .onion.
So you either have to know exactly what you're looking for or find a link in a forum, or just find a rough list of sites on some dark web wiki page of some sort. It's a bit complex but that's why they reference an onion with the dark web: because basically there are many layers to the dark web.
So download the TOR browser from a search engine link, have fun, and be safe. </p>
<p>Also, just for reference, it's said that only 4% of the Internet is the surface web</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Totally stealing this from another source that I cannot remember.</p>
<p>Imagine a pool. On the top are bright fuzzy tennis balls that represent websites like Facebook and Yelp. Then, there is also a pool skimmer that is a search engine. Most websites want to be found and picked up by that search engine and even have more fuzz to help them get picked up. This is the web that most people know and love.</p>
<p>Now imagine some smooth and heavy stones. They sink to the bottom, they have no fur to grab, and they try to remain hidden unless you already know where they are. These are websites on the dark web that try and hide their location from casual viewers. If someone told you to look 50 meters from the left corner of the pool and 12.7 meters down, sure you could find your specific dark website but very rarely will anyone else be able to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
