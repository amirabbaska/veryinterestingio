<p>You can watch the live thread of unfolding news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/live/wp1fvdxxwb45/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In business, you can avoid taxes by investing in something. If a company makes one million dollars, but spends 500,000 on investing in new technology for their product or something like that, they're only taxed from the remaining 500,000 because that's all of their &quot;profit.&quot; (I'm not a businessman so I'm not sure on the complete legality of all the kinds of spending but I think this is a basic summary). This is all normal and fine; all companies require investing in order to grow their company.</p>
<p>So a company in Panama basically made a business in creating fake businesses. Companies could &quot;invest&quot; million of dollars and then it wouldn't be taxed, because according to legal documents it isn't profit, it's an &quot;investment,&quot; which is untaxable, and then they would get their money back from the fake business. So imagine if that $500,000 of investments from my above example was fake, and after awhile 90% of the money was given back to the business (I'm assuming the Panamian company took a cut of the money as payment).  2.6 TB of data in total, over 11 million documents and over 200,000 fake companies. According to <a href="http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4/" target="_blank">the website that published the news of the leak</a>, they were contacted by an anonymous source with encrypted files with the data sometime in 2015. Here's am exerpt from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently there's several trillion dollars of money that should've been taxed and wasnt. Not sure if that means trillions that should've been taxed off of, or trillions of dollars of straight tax money, but either way it's a LOT.</p>
<p>Many political leaders (many seem to be in the Middle East), and celebrities are involved as well. To prevent any one person from being blamed for the leak, hundreds of news organizations are going to release further full details tonight (that's what Ive heard, not sure how true it is) but the list apparently has thousands of people/companies on it. There's 11 million documents though, and even though hundreds of journalists have been going through the data for months, there's still information that has yet to come to light.</p>
<p>This goes much farther than tax evasion, and includes Syrian war crimes, human trafficking, and more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XnH_OnpO0" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a video explaining it.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR Big names in business, politics, and sports used fake companies to evade trillions of dollars worth in tax money.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok let me give this ELI5 a shot.</p>
<p>You guys know income taxes, right? Okay, so companies also have to pay them, but <strong>business expenses are tax-deductible, which means that if companies spend the money they made they don't have to pay the taxes on those moneys.</strong></p>
<p>Stay with me.</p>
<p>Suppose you're a newly rich guy in a capitalist nation and your company has made $300m in profits. You owe about ~35% in income tax, or $105m. I know right? That's a lot of money.</p>
<p>Now let's assume that you're a good guy and aren't inherently evil or anything. You go to a cocktail party with some also-very-rich friends (because, you know, that's what rich people do, they flock together)
and you're talking to the &quot;cool kids&quot;, trying to mingle and stuff, and you complain that you have to pay this mind-boggling huge amount of money to the gov't and how <em>&quot;that sucks, right guys?&quot;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Instantly they laugh at you and go like: &quot;You silly, you must be new here. You're not really thinking on paying all those taxes right?</strong> All you gotta do is spend most of that money so that your profits are close to $0, and you have to pay no income tax, <em>duuh</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, you can't buy things for yourself with your company's money prior to income-taxation (that's against the law) and you don't even want to spend it all at once, so you <em>just transfer them to another fake company in Panama and label that as &quot;expenses&quot; in your company's income tax papers.</em> Yes. <strong><del>The same one your friends use.</del> Incorporated by the same law firm your friends use.</strong>^((Mossack Fonseca)^)</p>
<p>If you transfer $295m to Panama Co. and declare a $5m profit, you pay only ~$1.8m in taxes, about 1% of the amount you really owe the gov't. And no one has to know that company belongs to you as well.</p>
<p>And voilà, with a simple combination of group-pressure and <em>&quot;well-if-everyone's-doing-it-since-forever-and-nothing-has-ever-gone-wrong&quot;</em> thinking you've dodged the law and effectively stole millions from the gov't and the peoples. Except that, well... things don't always repeat the past, and now they have gone <strong>terribly wrong</strong>. Oh shit.</p>
<p>Alright. But it doesn't stop here. These offshore companies in Panama aren't obliged to disclose information about the owners, sources and use of the proceeds they incorporate.</p>
<p>And so, they can also be used to hide money earned from/used in criminal activities such as financing terror groups and <del>prostitution</del> forced prostitution/people trafficking and pedophiles and all sorts of disturbing inhumane things.</p>
<p>Hope I made a decent job explaining :) </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thank you very much for the kind words! I will need help from fellow redditors to answer all the great questions you've made. Also, made a couple minute technical changes to the text, so it's more accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get a quarter you put it in the piggy bank. The piggy bank is on a shelf in your closet. Your mom knows this and she checks on it every once in a while, so she knows when you put more money in or spend it. </p>
<p>Now one day, you might decide &quot;I don't want mom to look at my money.&quot; So you go over to Johnny's house with an extra piggy bank that you're going to keep in his room. You write your name on it and put it in his closet. Johnny's mom is always very busy, so she never has time to check on his piggy bank. So you can keep yours there and it will stay a secret.</p>
<p>Now all the kids in the neighborhood think this is a good idea, and everyone goes to Johnny's house with extra piggy banks. Now Johnny's closet is full of piggy banks from everyone in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>One day, Johnny's mom comes home and sees all the piggy banks. She gets very mad and calls everyone's parents to let them know.</p>
<p>Now not everyone did this for a bad reason. Eric's older brother always steals from his piggy bank, so he just wanted a better hiding spot. Timmy wanted to save up to buy his mom a birthday present without her knowing. Sammy just did it because he thought it was fun. But many kids did do it for a bad reason. Jacob was stealing people's lunch money and didn't want his parents to figure it out. Michael was stealing money from his mom's purse. Fat Bobby's parents put him on a diet, and didn't want them to figure out when he was buying candy.</p>
<p>Now in real life, many very important people were just caught hiding their piggy banks at Johnny's house in Panama. Today their moms all found out. Pretty soon, we'll know more about which of these important people were doing it for bad reasons and which were doing it for good reasons. But almost everyone is in trouble regardless, because it's against the rules to keep secrets no matter what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
