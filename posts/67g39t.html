<p>Thanks for all the answers so far but this user has my question right:</p>
<p>/u/cleverlikeme </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the OP is actually asking about 'background' conversations that aren't distinguishable audibly but still get clear subtitles.
In other words, in some movies, you can read some dialogue that is actually impossible to hear because it's mumbled, trailing off, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/u/Aomidoro</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would be very curious to hear from somebody who actually has industry experience with this, because as described by the OP it does seem like sometimes the closed captioning must be produced from the actual script because it contains dialog that is not actually discernible.
Closed captions produced in realtime for live tv inevitable have mistakes (I believe they are produced on some sort of phonetic chord-based keyboard?), but actually even closed captions for tv shows that aren't live sometimes have large numbers of errors. I noticed this before on either amazon video or netflix: the closed captions had situations where clearly the person making them didn't understand the word being used (especially for technical terms), so obviously in this case they weren't working from the script.
Therefore it seems like there are different ways these captions get made? My guess is that there are essentially two different processes depending on whether a show is captioned by a separate company or whether the captions are from subtitles produced by the actual makers of the show (or perhaps it's simply an issue of whether the creators of the show bother to provide the script or not?), but I'm curious if anyone knows whether this is actually the case?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a class on subtitling in college and it's really important to realize that subtitles, be them for deaf/hard-of-hearing or from on language to another, are a form of poetry. When you bring in time into the situation of reading all kinds of rules pop up. How many characters you can use is a big one, so you might rather use the word &quot;gross&quot; over &quot;disgusting&quot; for the sake of a shorter subtitle that can actually be read in time. You might correct someone's stutter or mis-speak, unless of course it is critical to the film. </p>
<p>The main goal of subtitles is to make the film watchable for someone who can not hear or for someone who does not speak the language the film is in. This means you will make sacrifices, jokes will be lost, information in general will be lost, cultural references, and word play are very common examples.</p>
<p>In response to the initial question, the subtitler  should use their best judge of whether what needs to be subtitled and what doesn't. Does a visual explosion need &quot;<Explosion Sound>&quot; no it does not, but say an explosion is happening and it is silent! Now the subtitle &quot;<Silence>&quot; would be super helpful to the viewer.</p>
<p>One last factor, is depending on the movie you saw it could have been subtitled with computers which do a terrible job. The best subtitles are still done by humans who can use their best judgement as to what should be included.</p>
<p>EDIT: As others brought up it's important to not confuse closed captioning and subtitling. Watch a Criterion DVD if you want to see A+ human done subtitles, watch Netflix or the live news if you want to see a computer type out what it &quot;hears&quot;. To properly answer the original question I'd need to actually see what the OP saw. I have subtitled films before, one a documentary and some 1920s short films french-&gt; english. I had the script to neither, and of course the documentary didn't have one. Having script would help discern what someone is saying, but it does not always take into account things subtitles do (nor does it take into account tone or the way a word is said which is very important). This includes when the camera cuts, when it's a voice over dub, music, etc. A subtitle is only up right when the person starts talking, and down as soon as they are finished. If they're talking fast, better come up with something that sums it all up. If they're talking and mid-sentence it cuts, you do a new subtitle, this one being in italics (because the character speaking is not on screen). There's a language to subtitling you may understand without even realizing it. Download a freeware subtitling program, you subtitle frame by frame you the precision with nicer programs is amazing. First you go through the movie marking where subtitle will be then you go back and type in what each subtitle is. As you go you keep notes that you refered to or spelled things the same way the whole time. So if you refer to an &quot;automobile&quot; as a &quot;car&quot; in the subtitles to save space you better keep using the word &quot;car&quot; throughout the whole movie as not to become confusing. This goes double for slang you translate or type out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sometimes the dialogue (especially if done in the background) is kinda quit to hear if you're not in a cinema. Depends on the movie. But sometimes I wonder if you're supposed to hear the dialogue or not.</p>
<p>I assume that the subtitles are written after the script, even if the execution in the movie is hard/impossible to hear for (artistic) reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are confusing closed captioning with subtitles. Subtitles only mean the lines of text on the movies for reading, and when used alone, generally only for spoken sentences. Closed captioning includes all noise related things essential to watching the movie, including explosions sounds and whatnot. </p>
<p>Now to answer OPs questions, subtitles most often have official subtitles, and other unofficial ones may be just ported from these, perhaps translated or copied from released movie script. You're probably thinking of srt files that come with video downloads, but remember, movie theatres also have access to subtitles that they can display. One instance I can think of was Thor dark world, where the dark elves talk. It's in a completely made up language so no one should know what it's talking about, but official subtitles show that they actually are saying something, and when I watched it in the theatres it was displayed. I only realized it wasn't embedded to the movie when I tried watching it a week ago without subtitles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
