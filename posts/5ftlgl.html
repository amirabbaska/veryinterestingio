		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you've played monopoly before, you know that there are players and a banker. Players lose when they run out of money or owe the banker. The banker collects money on real estate transactions, and let's limit it to that in this scenario. </p>
<p>But the government is neither player nor banker; it's the game maker. Its stake is in keeping the game on an even keel, enforcing rules of play, and making sure things progress in an orderly way. </p>
<p>Can the maker of the game lose? Not really. The currency is made by the maker of the game. The only way the game maker loses is if the players lose confidence in the game's rules, currency, or just say, &quot;This is dumb and it's all fake property and fake paper.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>So, let's say the maker of the game says that in every 10 turns, there will be another small stack of money in Free Parking and players always collect $200 when passing Go.</strong> That stack can either come from money taken out of the gameplay (community chest payments, etc.), or the maker of the game can make some more monopoly money to put there. It's real monopoly money either way. Over time, more money will get taken out of the gameplay, and it should roughly balance. </p>
<p>If more money goes into the game than comes out (&quot;Everyone take an extra $1000 each turn!&quot;), eventually there's so much monopoly money that it is worthless, and the game is done. If less money goes into the game than comes out (&quot;No Free Parking. Doubles pays a fine of $500 every time.&quot;), gameplay gets <em>hard</em> and it starts to make the game unpleasant to play. </p>
<p>So the game maker has to calibrate the amount of money at play to keep things moving, without it becoming silly.</p>
<p><strong>The future promise of money in Free Parking and for passing Go  is national debt.</strong> </p>
<p>The only way the game maker can lose (go bankrupt) is to say, &quot;Yeah, no, I won't give you money for passing Go this time.&quot; This is called <strong>defaulting on the debt</strong>. It's a quick way for the game maker to fail. Other ways the game maker could lose (be bankrupt) would be to add too much money, or not enough money, or change the other game rules often. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way an individual can be in debt several hundred thousand dollars and not be bankrupt: you make your regular monthly payments to the organizations you owe money. </p>
<p>Each year the US spends over $200 billion dollars (about 6% of the whole federal budget) making payments against the national debt. The government won't ever pay off the debt at that rate (especially if it keeps borrowing more), but it keeps the creditors happy. </p>
<p>Debt does not equal bankruptcy. Inability to make the payments on your debts is what leads to bankruptcy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As long as one can continue to pay their debt when it's due, they aren't bankrupt. The U.S. also has trillions in revenue from taxes and can literally print money, so it's not going to default. Current debt is about equal to annual GDP -- so that's sort of like an individual having debt equal to their income. But think about a person with a mortgage, car payment, and student loans... they might have debt that's 4-5x times their income, yet as long as they can keep making the monthly payments they are not bankrupt. They may have a negative net worth, but they're not bankrupt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy is when you're unable to pay off your debts.  The US rakes in 7 trillion annually from taxes alone, they have never missed a payment and always pay with interest.  Loaning money to the US is a great deal as they will very reliably pay it back, and continue paying interest on it potentially for decades. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
