		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You transferred some bacteria to his hands, which were destroyed if the disinfectant was still present in sufficient quantity (i.e. not evaporated).</p>
<p>There's no such thing as &quot;transferring cleanliness&quot; much like there's no such thing as &quot;transferring coldness.&quot; Hot things transfer heat to cold objects, much like there was a net transfer of (temporarily) live bacteria from your hands to his. </p>
<p>In reality, what probably happened was a transfer of some bacteria to his hands (which were killed if he still had disinfectant on them like you say), and you took some of the disinfectant onto your hands too, which killed bacteria on your hands as well.</p>
<p>By the way, your body is crawling with bacteria like you wouldn't believe. They aren't bad—your skin exists to keep them out and to control. In most cases, there is no need to disinfect your kids' hands unless you or they have an active cold. And the immune system—especially in childhood—requires stimulation for proper development and function. There's been a slew of research that correlates insufficient exposure to &quot;germs&quot; and other foreign bodies with a higher rate of allergy development as well as autoimmune disorders. One reason for the recent FDA move to pull antibacterial soaps off the market is because they didn't actually do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL;DL: Some bacteria is stronger than others, and will &quot;win&quot; against other bacteria. If person A has a strong bacteria colony on their hand, and person B does not, some of person A's bacteria will try and set up a colony on person B's hand. To answer the question here. If the disinfectant was still present, likely a lot of bacteria would die. If not, some of the &quot;dirty hand&quot; bacteria would likely set up shop on the &quot;clean hand&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Those aren't mutually exclusive, so it could be both. The question would be whether or not you used enough hand sanitizer to destroy the bacteria on both of your hands.  </p>
<p>It's like asking, &quot;If I pour hand sanitizer on my left hand and rub my hands together, am I making my left hand dirtier or my right hand cleaner?&quot;</p>
<p>If you used just enough for his hands, it's likely that the sanitizer took care of the bacteria on his hands, but couldn't kill all of the ones on your hands. If you put too much on his hands, and it was enough for both of you, then ... it's enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ecosystems on both your hands went to battle for a brief moment. The dominant cultures probably stayed the same, many bacteria have died on this day, very little has changed though. I jest, but in truth there is no such thing as a &quot;clean&quot; hand.  The supposedly &quot;sterile&quot; hands after washing are actually a breeding ground for new pathogens. The instant the disinfectant stopped acting (after water rinse) an exponential growth pattern of any and all air born microbes began on your child's hands. the moment you touched his hand, you re-inoculated his hands with whatever was growing on your hands... the cracks and crevices of your wrinkles probably had a different ecology than the smooth surfaces, mites and other slightly larger microbes probably went along with the bacteria, viruses, and whatever else happened to be there... the niches may be slightly different between you and your kid so the end ecology of the two area's likely ended up slightly different.  The longer you don't touch your kids hands the more his established ecology proliferates, the more you touch him.. the more your ecology is present... his ecology having less effect on yours, as yours is more established. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germs will always spread to areas of lower concentration given they can stay alive/dangerous in that medium. The adhesive and cohesive properties of microbes depends on many factors and can be quite complex. When you probe smaller regimes, water tension and van der wals forces become significant. But ultimately, a clean hand can only gain dirt and a dirty hand loses dirt to the clean one. If you define cleaning as the subtraction of dirt from something that isn't dirt, then it should be acceptable to say when the dirty hand loses mass in the form of dirt, it is quantifiably getting cleaner. The dirt lost partially escapes into the environment, and the remainder attaches to the clean hand. So if losing mass in dirt is becoming cleaner, the inverse can be said too. As the clean hand gains mass in dirt, the hand becomes dirty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
