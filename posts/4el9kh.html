		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pens dry out because the ink contains solvents. The solvents are volatile and will evaporate if exposed to the air too much.  </p>
<p>The caps slow this down but they don't completely prevent it. The solvents will still evaporate but will largely just sit inside the lid if there's no air moving past the pen.</p>
<p>The holes in the lid are there so children are less likely to choke and suffocate if they swallow one.  </p>
<p>Edit: I'll just add this...   </p>

<p>None of the top comments at (this time) mention that the ball (in most ball-point pens) is spring loaded, and when depressed/touching allows the ink to flow around the ball and onto whatever it is touching.</p>
<p>I can speculate;<br />
W/ the cap on, noting can press on the ball, and the spring is able to then close the ink off from the air. - w/ the cap off, the ball can be is depressed slightly b the seight of the pen, (or contact with the container) allowing air to dry the ink out.</p>
<p>Since the ink (in most ball point pens) is gravity fed, storing the pens point up is not ideal, and frequently the pint will come to rest at the bottom of whatever cup or basket pens are stored in.</p>
<p>Surface tension drawing the solvent from ink out and into/onto the pen's container may also have some effect.</p>
<p>The hole is to make removing the cap easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over a long period of time a pen with the cap will dry out at the tip, if you apply pressure to the back of the ink line, you'll break through the dried ink and capillary action will take over again.</p>
<p>Anyways, the cap creates a dead zone of air around the tip of the pen, since the air is mostly non-moving the ink around the tip will stay liquid much longer. With the cap off the subtle movements of air will dry out the ink, similar to how a breeze will cause a small puddle to dry out on a driveway even in winter.</p>
<p>The holes in the cap are to reduce the chances of suffocation if it gets inhaled. Bic pioneered this in 1991 after it was determined that it was one of the common things that children were choking on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What the others have said, plus that, if you look closely on the cap, there is often an outer cap (with holes) and an inner cap which just sits over the tip (without holes). So, even if the big cap has holes, the tip is still resting snugly in it's little inner cap, with no air circulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
