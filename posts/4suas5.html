		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AM means amplitude modulation and FM means frequency modulation.</p>
<p>Think of it as amplitude is like strength and frequency is like style.  </p>
<p>Signals that are based on amplitude modulation (strength) are more susceptible to noise (static) because the signal strength can be affected by other factors, and it's harder to filter that static out.</p>
<p>Signals based on frequency (style) are less susceptible to noise because their &quot;strength&quot; may be affected but not their &quot;style&quot;, and it's easier to filter out the noise.</p>
<p>Strength-based signals can go further but they lack style (quality), whereas style-based signals can't go as far but they retain their quality.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I realize there have been a lot of comments...and as I scroll down...I'm sure someone has probably said much of what I'm about to. But in great reddit fashion (and because I'm lazy and don't want to spend a few additional hours on a comment that will take me a good 30 minutes to write), I'm just gonna write all my thoughts on the subject and let people do with it what they will.</p>
<p>The <em>MAIN</em> thing you notice between AM and FM is the frequency response of the audio. An FM broadcast is capable of 15khz of audio response; this is just 5khz shy of your maximum hearing range. It's not actually full-CD range fidelity; but it's actually higher response and fidelity than any other broadcasting medium...excluding digital.</p>
<p>On an AM broadcast....it gets a little more difficult. For starters, yes, the frequency response of an AM station is greatly diminished than that of an FM station; but the amount of degradation is <em>really</em> complicated by the design of the radio. To put it simply, your AM radio (not just yours...but pretty much every radio made since the 30s) only has 5khz of audio response; just 5. This is marginally better than a telephone. There are numerous reasons for that I will get in to; but I will say the 5khz of response you get from your radio is actually only about <em>half</em> of what a good AM broadcast is capable of; which is about 10khz. </p>
<p>10khz isn't really all that bad. It's only 2 or 3 khz less than what analog NTSC audio was capable of; it's only 2 or 3 khz less than what you got out of the average cassette tape; and it's only 1khz less than the amount of frequency response you'd get out of a digital audio file sampled at 22.050khz. </p>
<p>The main problem...like many said...boils down to the differences in modulation. AM is an amplitude modulation; where as FM is a frequency modulation. Everyone's said this...and in very creative ways. But I'm already knee-deep in to this...so I have to give my explanation.</p>
<p>Amplitude modulation means exactly that; you are modifying the aplitude of your carrier wave according to the audio input. Audio gets louder, carrier gets louder; audio gets quiet, carrier level drops. The beauty is the simplicity of it; you can demodulate the signal by simply using a diode! You feed in your RF signal, and through the diodes rectification...you get this varying voltage that's basically the audio used to modulate the carrier. This is how crystal sets worked without power; you were relying on a tuned circuit to &quot;filter&quot; out frequencies...then sending that RF directly in to a diode. Most AM tuners from a by-gone era basically did this for AM.</p>
<p>Compare this with FM...in which the carrier level stays the same, but it's frequency changes with the audio input. It's a much more complicated system to receive...but it has major advantages.</p>
<p>So, basically, an AM detector/demodulator is responding to instantaneous changes in amplitude of the carrier...so noise and static are treated just like a signal. An FM detector on the other hand; it doesn't care WHAT the amplitude is...as long as it can &quot;track&quot; the carrier, it will produce an output. </p>
<p>I usually use this analogy. AM is like a light that's blinking...well..not really blinking...but it's intensity is changing constantly. In a dark room, you can easily make it out; but as the ambient light level increases...it becomes more difficult to make out. FM is basically like an RGB light that's the same brightness...but rapidly changing colors. It gets difficult to make out the light when the ambient light increases; but you can easily make out the color differences. </p>
<p>But what about that 5khz nonsense I spoke about? This exists because your radio has filtering in it...it exists for many reasons...but primarily it exists because your radio isn't actually demodulating the radio signal at the frequency it's tuned to. Back in the 20s, the same guy that would go on to invent FM modulation also invented what was known as the superhetrodyne receiver. This solved a problem they had back then....the current technology did not work well with &quot;high frequencies&quot;. You could not amplify a radio signal at 1000khz very well. In really old radios; you had tuned circuits feeding amplifying tubes...but you didn't get much gain; so you usually had to have multiple stages of amplification, with a tuned circuit on each one; and you had to manually tune each stage to the same frequency. </p>
<p>Superhets &quot;fixed&quot; that. By generating it's own carrier signal, it could &quot;mix&quot; this with the antenna input; the result would be multiple copies of your signal at different frequencies. The lower copies were in a range that the technology of the era could work with. So your average radio is doing several things...it's generating a carrier that's so many khz off of the signal you want; it applies a basic RF filtering, mixes the antenna with the carrier...then it can proceed to work on this lower frequency signal. This lower frequency signal is called an intermediate frequency, or IF for short. Part of the IF process includes filtering; which they filter for 10khz of RF. This was mainly done to increase intelligiblity...because higher frequency noise is more &quot;annoying&quot; than low frequency noise. </p>
<p>So...part of the reason is it was an artificial reduction of quality to improve usefulness. </p>
<p>Is the radio in your car a superhet? 99.999999% certain it is. Superhet kind of took over as the dominate form of receiver; a little more complicated...but more sensitive than anything else that had been designed. In fact, the only thing that outdoes a superhet in most cases would be Software Defined Radio...which basically connects your antenna to a super-fast ADC...and does all the other nonsense in software. Yes, you can actually run a radio in software becuase, when you get down to it....a radio is just a very complicated calculator that runs a very specific set of instructions. I mean...literally...just about every form of modulation can be described as a mathmatical equation...and therefore run in software.</p>
<p>AM is an afterthought these days; so the radios in modern cars aren't anywhere near as good as they used to be. Most of the time it's just a function on a chip...sometimes it's an actual dedicated chip vs discreet components. Even some of the high-end receivers aimed at consumers have cheap lousy AM sections in it.</p>
<p>Our modern digital world is also to blame. Since AM is sensitive to noise....it's losing the battle with modern electronics. Most people don't realize it; but the stuff you have in your house is an absolute nightmare RF wise. <em>IF</em> it even complies with FCC part 15 for emissions....that doesn't mean when you have 50,000 of them in a small area that it doesn't add up. Plus...most people are violating FCC rules and not even realizing it; most of the &quot;grow lamps&quot; I've seen people buy and install are not approved for residential use...and actually shouldn't even be sold to homeowners; they're Part 19 and only approved for commercial and industrial installation. And anything you get out of China off eBay....forget it. That is not going to comply. I have had after-market laptop supplies completely flood the AM (and HF) bands with noise...even when I'm 200ft away from the thing. </p>
<p>The reason AM sucks is complicated...it stems from artificial limitations to &quot;improve&quot; the situation, aggravated by manufacturers who don't give two craps about AM radio; and consumers who love their cheap Chinese goods so much they are literally a massive FCC violation. </p>
<p>But don't worry...the FCC is trying to fix the AM problem...and most of the suggestions they've come up with will lead to the death of AM radio. In a few years...you won't have to worry about AM sounding bad because it probably won't be there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you can imagine instead of a radio tower there is a giant lightbulb.  This is essentially the same thing electromagnetic energy but instead of being in the radio part of the spectrum it is in the light part of the spectrum.</p>
<p>With the AM (amplitude modulation) lightbulb the signal would be varied by adjusting the brightness of the light.  With the FM(frequency modulation) the light would change in color to produce a signal.</p>
<p>If you were trying to see this signal through static, say a bunch of trees it was be much easier to see what color was coming through than how bright the light was.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an easy one - Bandwidth.  The FCC limits the frequency bandwidth (how much signal spectrum a station can occupy) to 10kHz for AM.  The frequency response of station would be determined by 1/2 of the bandwidth - therefore an AM station is limited by rules to top out at 5kHz (this is the highest treble note it can carry), or for comparison, just slightly better than your telephone.  The lower end of the frequency is limited by the FCC to I think 50 Hz? sonce AM doesn't carry bass frequencies well without tromping on its neighbors.</p>
<p>It all boils down to how many stations they want to cram on the dial.  AM has a habit of travelling huge distances, especially at night, and even more so during the winter.  This is something that FM doesn't have a problem with - it's line of sight only.  AM bounces off the Ionosphere and FM goes right through it.  A simple 6-tube Zenith 6S254 from 1938 in my living room when I lived in SE Oklahoma could pick up WLS Chicago, KOA Denver, WSM Nashville, and others in St Louis, Minneapolis, Atlanta, etc.  This is with just the built-in loop antenna!  A simple coil about 24&quot; x 10&quot;.  If I used an outdoor antenna, I'd likely pick up Canada and Mexico easily.  </p>
<p>All this bouncing of the signal through the atmosphere makes it difficult to ensure that the AM stations don't occupy the same spot on the dial and drown each other out if they're too near each other.  There's only so many spaces on the dial.  They do this by assigning each station its own &quot;channel&quot; on the dial.  No other transmitter can legally live on that dial spot unless they're out of the theoretical reach of the transmitter (determined by how much power the station has, anywhere from 200 Watts to 50,000 watts).  The wider your station's frequency response, the bigger chunk of the spectrum it takes, and the bigger the spot it occupies on the dial.  For a 10kHz upper response you'd need a channel 20kHz wide, yielding half the number of places to park a station on the dial.  </p>
<p>One other important aspect is the quality of the receiver design.  Modern AM radios are garbage in comparison to one from the 60's or 70's (comparing apples to apples, consider transistorized radios only, not vacuum tube).  People migrated to FM starting in the late 60s/early 70s, so by the mid 80s, radio manufacturers stopped putting the money into the AM side of the radio and just built a cheap, functional one, placing their manufacturing costs elsewhere in the circuit such as a better FM radio, better amplifier, etc.  The buying public that actually noticed was a very small slice of radio sales, resulting in your average AM portion of a radio today being not much better than a pocket radio 30 years prior.  Folks don't want to pay for it, so manufacturers don't care about making &quot;Good&quot; AM receivers.</p>
<p>In the 1930's and 40's they experimented with high fidelity AM broadcasts.  From what I read, they had frequency response of 10kHz on the top end.  Of course, there were fewer stations then so they had more space to &quot;stretch their legs and arms&quot;.   I have a couple of console radios from the late 1930's (a Philco 38-116XX, 15 tubes and 12&quot;(?) speaker and a Zenith 12S265, 12 tubes and 10&quot;(?) speaker).  They both have VERY good sound, both bass and treble when fed by a home-built low-power transmitter.  AM radio stations can't do this because they expect to be heard beyond a few feet from the transmitter (MUCH more powerful) and are governed by the FCC rules that keep everyone playing nice with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AM (Amplitude Modulation) and FM (Frequency Modulation) are ways of broadcasting radio signals. Both transmit the information in the form of electromagnetic waves. AM works by varying the amplitude of the signal according to the information being sent, while the frequency remains constant.
This differs from FM technology in which information (sound) is encoded by varying the frequency of the wave and the amplitude is kept constant.</p>
<p>FM is less susceptible to natural radio noise because noise affects the amplitude of a received signal, not its frequency. </p>
