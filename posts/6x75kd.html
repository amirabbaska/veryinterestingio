		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can actually have a pretty significant effect on communications. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2aed/1ae6a8739069d3bc6f638758458425b079ca.pdf" target="_blank">In particular, if S(f) is the spectrum of your original signal, S(<em>a</em>f) will be the spectrum afterwards (PDF).</a> Here <em>a</em> is relatively close^(1) to 1, basically 1 - v/c where c is the speed of light and v the velocity of the object. At most the shift will be a few Hz.</p>
<p>The shift in Hz is not a problem, in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop" target="_blank">phase lock loop</a> are already usually applied so that the receiver can reap the gains of using coherent demodulators (PDF) <a href="http://wireless.ece.ufl.edu/twong/Notes/Comm/ch2.pdf" target="_blank">see here (PDF)</a>. Phase lock loops help to account for artifacts such as signal drift, and so on. The point being this is not where the problem comes in.</p>
<p>The big problem is what occurs with multi-path communications. If your signal has multiple reflections (like, if you are in a room of some sort instead of in an open field). When moving now, there will be a different velocity shift depending on the angle of arrival of the wave. And because of this the signal, being the sum of the different waves, can experience a wide arrange of channels. <del>Some of these channels will begin to have different interference patterns.</del> This is problematic though as the capacity (maximum amount of bits/second that can be sent over it) basically defaults to the minimum rate achievable over all possible channels simultaneously (see <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~prakash/papers/Csiszar_Narayan-IT_1991.pdf" target="_blank">Theorem 1 (PDF)</a>). <del>Thus if one of those bands you pass over has a really bad channel, there goes your ability to connect in general.</del> While the variation due only to doppler shift will be small (about 80 Hz for 5 mph over 5GHz), it is just on the edge of what is considered to not be completely trivial.^(2)</p>
<p>Anytime you transmit a code with a higher rate than the capacity of the channel, an error will occur. As a result a moving source does increase the probability of packet error, with the probability increase depending on the speed and strength of the reflections. </p>
<p>The same principal applies to AM and FM radio. Although both of which are horribly inefficient in terms of transferring information, so it is unlikely that it would have a noticeable impact. To put it in perspective, a WiFi router is trying to transmit at the very edge of comprehension, while AM and FM require the signal to be easily understandable. Adding a little bit more noise to the WiFi signal will move it past the point of comprehension, while for AM and FM the added noise will still result in a large enough SNR for it to not make a difference. </p>
<p>Edit-- </p>
<p>1 - correction due to /u/devman0 </p>
<p>2 - Added later, as was pointed out by /u/dirtyuncleron69 and /u/dayzstu. Crossed out what is not directly attributable to the doppler shift.  </p>
<p>Also, while on the edit, for a much more in depth discussion about how we model movement and the impact this has on communication, please see <a href="https://wsl.stanford.edu/~andrea/Wireless/SampleChapters.pdf" target="_blank">Wireless Communications by Andrea Goldsmith</a>. She is the most prominent authority on the subject. Chapter 3 in particular talks about this exact scenario in realistic environments, and chapter 5 the impact on capacity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing modulation frequency and the wave frequency. The wave frequency is in 2.4GHz or 5.8Ghz. <em>That</em> is what would change if you were to run towards or away from the router. So you would be slightly shifting the frequency away from it's channel but you would have to move very fast for this to exceed the lock range of the receiver. The modulation rate (how fast the waveform is changed to encode data) would not be affected. So there is no way to make it go faster by moving. But if you move fast enough (way faster than running) to cause transmission errors and trigger retransmissions, you might make it slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So... okay, wifi uses radio waves (at a particular frequency) to exchange information between your computer and your router. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, just like light, X-rays, etc. but their frequency is much lower. This means they carry less energy, so they're not harmful, unlike gamma rays at the opposite end of the <a href="https://cdn.miniphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/electromagneticspectrum.jpg" target="_blank">spectrum</a>. </p>
<p>Now, because radio waves are electromagnetic radiation, they travel at the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s) which is... really fast. The speed is slightly lower in air, but this is still a good approximation. </p>
<p>Doppler shift is when, due to relative motion, a wave is &quot;squished&quot; or &quot;stretched&quot;. In light, when the wave gets &quot;squished,&quot; since the speed at which it travels remains unchanged but either the object receiving the wave or the object emitting it are in motion, the frequency increases and the wavelength gets shorter. <a href="http://images.tutorvista.com/cms/images/83/frequency-wavelength-image1.PNG" target="_blank">Here</a> is a visual explanation of what frequency and wavelength are, just in case anyone reading this doesn't know. When the frequency of a light wave increases, the color you see is closer to violet. This is what blue shift is. The opposite happens when the wave gets &quot;stretched&quot;: frequency decreases and wavelength gets longer, so we see it as closer to red (red shift). </p>
<p>So supposing you were to run toward you wifi router, since the radio waves traveling from it to your computer don't change their speed, the frequency at which they reach your computer's antenna would be higher (but only very slightly) because you'd be &quot;squishing&quot; the waves, so to speak. If you ran away, the frequency would be lower.</p>
<p>Unless you were able to move at very high velocities relative to your wifi router, the difference wouldn't be very meaningful. Remember that these waves are traveling at the speed of light, and that's 300,000,000 m/s. A person walking moves at about 1 m/s. As far as the radio wave knows, there isn't much difference between you staying still and you moving at, say, 3 m/s. (I actually don't know how fast people run, but this is simply a random number). For the wave, you're pretty much essentially staying still anyway. This is why we can't actually <em>see</em> red shift and blue shift, even though we hear it. Sound waves travel at much lower speeds than light does, so the difference there is audible, but since light moves so fast, our eyes can't really detect the slight (very slight) difference in color. </p>
<p>So your computer receives the wifi signal at a very slightly different frequency. This wouldn't affect download speed in a noticeable way. If you were moving fast enough, then it may cause errors, though. The reason is that wifi is basically a kind of radio, so your computer receives the signal through an antenna. The antenna is capable of receiving signals at a range of frequencies. I'm not sure how big it is in wifi antennas, but my handheld radio uses the same antenna for a range of about 4MHz and another one for a range of about 30MHz (this one is at a higher set of frequencies). In other words, your computer will be able to receive the signal and should be able to interpret it unless you're able to move fast enough that the change in frequency falls outside the channel it's &quot;listening&quot; on. Due to nature, a radio wave at a frequency in particular actually &quot;spills over&quot; onto neighbor frequencies (and you may even hear harmonics on farther away frequencies), so it's not a neat signal that exists exclusively at that specific frequency. There's a bit of leeway.</p>
<p>I'll answer the bit about AM and FM in the afternoon, though, I'm late for class. But short answer: it shouldn't matter either, unless you're moving really fast. Then, the FM signal would have issues that the AM signal wouldn't- but if you're moving fast enough for that to happen, then you're not gonna be receiving the signal correctly to begin with because it'll have changed frequencies beyond what the radio can receive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked on 3g/4g mobile phone baseband. Doppler effect has a major role there. Exactly as the other posters said, the multiple paths that the signal takes to get from the base station to your mobile's antenna combine in ways that make resulting  received signal fluctuate wildly both in phase and amplitude. Dealing with this is one of the main tasks of the &quot;baseband&quot; processing chain. In fact, the mobile phone performance test specs have different test cases to cover a range of conditions, including different values of Doppler shift.</p>
<p>One other note. Doppler shift is significant even when there is no multipath. Imagine a mobile phone on a high speed train in Japan. Base stations are sometimes located near the train tracks. So the Doppler shift changes rapidly from, say plus 2kHz to minus 2kHz as the train zooms past the base station. So the AFC (automatic frequency correction) in the phone gets exercised heavily.</p>
<p>EDIT. I want to add that many of the other posts here, including the top post, have minor inaccuracies or misleading statements. The main missing piece of information that everyone has missed so far is that all current wireless systems use phase modulation. Either QAM or at least QPSK. This means that the information is encoded in the phase of the signal. Even the smallest amount of Doppler shift makes the phase rotate over time. The receiver has to constantly compensate for this effect. This is also one of the reasons why the mobile radio signal structure (encoding and modulation) is quite complex. This is also why Wi-Fi can't be used when mobile. Wi-Fi can't cope with high speed Doppler.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
