		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid breathing is breathing an oxygen enriched liquid instead of a gas. Oxygen will be able to dissolve in some liquids in high enough concentrations that it is possible for your lungs to extract enough oxygen from the liquid to stay alive. The advantage to using liquids and not gas is that gas will compress under pressure which can cause complications in some cases. The two main areas where liquid breathing may be used is in deep sea diving where super compressed air makes things more complicated and for high force maneuvers in jet fighters and rockets where suspending the body completely in liquid can prevent g-lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

While we can get enough oxygen into the blood by saturating the liquid we don't have a way of getting the carbon dioxide out fast enough.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid ventilation (I think this is what you're referring to) is something that's currently being developed/researched/looked at.</p>
<p>In terms of mechanically ventilating someone, from a physics standpoint, all ventilation is fluid ventilation, since you can treat gasses like a fluid.  for ventilating someone, we currently use an air/oxygen mixture (or just 100% oxygen) depending on what's required.  Liquid ventilation would be just changing the mixture, from air/oxygen to something else (that would still likely contain oxygen).</p>
<p>Ventilation functions based on pressure gradients (and a bunch of other factors but we'll focus on this one for now).  Things tend to go from high pressure to low pressure, high concentration to low concentration (in this case pressure and concentration are essentially the same, just a term for measurement.)</p>
<p>So when we want to get oxygen into your blood, we need more oxygen inside your lungs then in your blood to force the oxygen from the high concentration side (lungs) to the lower concentration side (your blood).  The process is the opposite for carbon dioxide.  The reason the average healthy person breathes is to get rid of CO2.  So we need less CO2 in your lungs than in your blood, so the CO2 will leave the blood and go into your lungs to be exhaled.</p>
<p>So the mixture of air/oxygen is just a medium.  We could use literally anything, as long as all the gas diffuses correctly.  The only issues we might come across are the actual fluid mechanics (how they vary between solutions) and dealing with how that would affect the lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In relation to diving, it doesnâ€™t.</p>
<p>Studies realized by the US Navy have so far (as far as I have read) shown that liquid breathing of some sort of oxygenated liquid is not likely to work due to the viscosity of the liquid itself. Without assisted ventilation, it would be impossible for a person to renew the liquid in its lungs often enough to avoid a Carbon Dioxide (CO2) buildup. CO2, being 20 times more narcotic than Nitrogen (N2) would thus produce more problems than it would solve.</p>
<p>I believe that currently, liquid breathing is only being seriously considered as a treatment for premature babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
