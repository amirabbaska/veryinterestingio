		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're in a loaf of bread and it expands, the &quot;spacetime&quot; is expanding. So a point near you is travelling away from you at 0.5c. But a point further away is travelling away from you at 0.5c PLUS the space growing between you, so it ends up as 1.5c. </p>
<p>Therefore, 13.8 bil years extrapolated by the space expansion gives us a 93 bil ly diameter of observable universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, so imagine a Rubber band. This is Space. Draw a black dot somewhere in the middle of the rubber band long ways. Now Draw a red dot on either side of the black dot going long ways. Take the rubber band between two hands and stretch out the the band. You'll notice the dots will move apart from one another. So we'll say the black dot is the big bang, and the red dots are pretty much anything else. They're moving apart due to the big bang.  so now imagine these objects are moving on their own also, and well say that they are going at light speed, plus being pushed along by the big bang. The objects are moving faster than light speed without physically moving faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always wondered: when we say that the universe is 14 billion years old, do we take in account the fact that time is dependent on space?
Surely a year at the birth of the universe did not last as long as a year now, so how has the universe's age been estimated?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's food for thought:</p>
<p>If our world was flat like a stick figure drawing, we could only move up/down/left/right. Wrap that same flat drawing all the way around a sphere and a stick figure man could walk far enough and end up back where he started. Stick figure guy can't comprehend the sphere he's walking around, and he's only still moving in one 2D direction, but he'll end up where he started none the less.</p>
<p><del>I think</del> ... This is all to say that there is a theory that ... the universe is a hypersphere. We have three dimensions to move around in within 'space', but there is a 4th dimensional 'horizon' to the shape of the universe that we cannot see past. If we went far enough, we might end up back at Earth. This idea is, more or less, the same as in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland" target="_blank">'Flatland'</a>.</p>
