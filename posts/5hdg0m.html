		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>She has been under the influence of the daughter of a cult leader since her mother has been assassinated. Everything from her speeches to her stance on North Korea to her wardrobe has been influenced by the Choi Soon Sil. Like almost all Korean politicians, she is corrupt, but in her case, stolen funds have gone to her shaman. The article below is a bit long but highly entertaining explaining the complete absurdity of the situation.</p>
<p>Stolen analogy: Imagine a conservative president claimed to be Christian, but was actually a Scientologist, and Tom Cruise and his posse including a gigolo and a music video director were managing all of the president's affairs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like most of the Western media, the answers here have focused on the fact that Choi Sun Sil was the daughter of a cultist. This is a pretty small part of the narrative in South Korea.</p>
<p>What really matters is that President Park gave Choi access to secret documents, and took her advice on policy matters. So an non-elected, non-appointed, non-vetted, private individual was given access to government documents and had influence over policy.</p>
<p>The corruption issue is also important, but that's less specifically about Park herself, and more about the systemic corruption that has been a feature of virtually every administration for the past 30 years. Samsung, Hyndai, Lotte and the other conglomerates were &quot;encouraged&quot; to donate money to a foundation controlled by Choi, which was assumed to be a retirement fund of sorts for Park. When the deputy head of Samsung was questioned about this in congressional hearings this week, he said &quot;If the government asks, it's hard to say no.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, Park was impeached because she broke the law, and the people are protesting en masse because they're sick of the same old shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
