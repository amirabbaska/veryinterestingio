Still, they need long exposures to capture the stars. The frame rate of the human eye is often said to be in the hundreds. So why can my eye see the stars with a 1/300 second exposure when cameras require 6 or 7 seconds before the same number of stars are visible in the image?</p></div></div>

<p>Now take a camera, have the shutter open and close about once a second for minutes, have a powerful computer that stabilises the image, adjusts light sensitivity, and plugs in gaps by recreating complete parts out of imagination/expectation and you would probably get a much better image than our eye.  </p>
<p>Its obviously not the hardware, its the software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sensor in a camera might be bigger than the sensor in your retina, but it’s trying to capture a whole scene. Hold your thumb up at arm’s length - that’s about the size of the image your macula captures in any given instant. The macula is the part of your retina that is densely packed with cone cells, which are the cells that give you high resolution colour vision.</p>
<p>The rest of your retina is largely rod cells, and those cells are what allow you to see the stars at night. They don’t discern colour - most of the colour you perceive at night is just you remembering or inferring - but you have a <em>lot</em> of them. Over 100,000,000. That’s a lot more than the number of sensing pixels in any camera.</p>
<p>But hang on - more pixels doesn’t make better cameras. We all know that. The more information you try to suck out of a camera’s sensor in less and less time - in other words, the higher the ISO setting - the noisier the image gets. Why don’t our eyes have that problem? At very very low levels, they actually do! In a pitch black room, the random noise from misfiring of come and rod cells actually becomes sort of visible. You can vaguely perceive colours and shapes. But mostly, we don’t experience the same levels of noise as a CCD because our eyes are biochemical, not electrical. The noise on a CCD is almost entirely due to its mechanism of operation, not a physical characteristic of the light entering through the lens.</p>
<p>But hang on! What about film cameras? Those are entirely chemical, and they’re even worse than digital for low light! Yes, but think about what they have to <em>do</em>. The film is a camera has to undergo a chemical reaction significant enough to change its colour (or its crystal structure) from <em>light alone</em>. There’s no external source of power priming the film to be ready to change, it has to do all the work on its own. The activation energy for film has to be low enough that it can be triggered by visible light, but high enough that it can’t be triggered by heat or movement. (Remember how you used to store film in the fridge?) Meanwhile, all your cone and rod cells have to do is leak some neurotransmitter to the optic nerve, which will happily amplify and clean up that signal before it gets sent off to the brain.</p>
<p>I hope this all makes sense, it’s 3:30am and insomnia is writing this post a bit. Check <a href="http://www.qsimaging.com/ccd_noise.html" target="_blank">this PetaPixel article</a> for some more info on cameras versus eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the key answer to this particular question is a superior dynamic range. Seeing different intensities and adapting gain for a particular scene or section of the scene, the region of interest, is something that human eye [and brain] is really good at. </p>
<p>Of course, I also agree with all previous speakers, who &quot;blame it&quot; on the integration of images, blur correction, focusing and other nice processing by the brain. </p>
<p>In fact, from what I've read, eye is not great piece of hardware, and I remember someone experimented with bovine [cows] eye/lens and found it rather sloppy imaging system, lens was uneven, full of aberrations, focusing by the muscles was sloppy, uneven, and resulting in new aberrations...  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The retina has layers of different cell types that serve to pre-process the image prior to sending that for further processing in visual cortex. Forgive me, it's been years since I've gone over the physiology but I think &quot;center surround&quot; antagonism enhances contrast but you'd be better off googling a scientific article than me trying to remember and explain it. There are a few different cell types that process visual information in the retina and I think it is here where the visual discrimination of the light source occurs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eye wouldn't see much if it didn't move. Your eye is constantly darting around taking multiple &quot;pictures&quot; and your brain is stitching together a whole scene.</p>
<p>Also, if you walked out of a bright room and looked up at the stars, it would still take you 7 second to see them, but it isn't a shutter issue, is the chemistry in eye is changing to make it more sensitive to low light. A night vision camera with gain adjustments would be more of a comparison to what you are asking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
