		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL; DR: computers and TVs are about emitting the colors we want. Paintings are about absorbing the colors we don't want from the white light around us in order to get the colors that we want</strong></p>
<p>What color we see is based on what frequencies of light hit our eyes. The different frequencies are represented by the colors of the rainbow. White is what we see when we see a combination of all frequencies and black/dark is what we see when there are no photons (no light at any frequency)</p>
<p>So what causes light to hit your eyes? Well, some things emit light such as lightbulbs, the sun, your computer screen. But we also have light that hits our eyes after it bounced off an object. So that blue car on the street? It's not emitting a blue light, but white sunlight is hitting that car, and blue light is bouncing off of it into our eyes.</p>
<p>Why did the white light change to blue light when it bounced off a blue object? Because light can be absorbed, and all of the frequencies in the white light (which remember, white is a combination of everything in the rainbow) got absorbed except blue.</p>
<p>So there are two ways to create colors: emitting frequencies you want and absorbing the frequencies you don't want.</p>
<p>If you start with nothing (black/darkness), you can create any color you want by adding together red, green, blue light frequencies (additive). If you start with everything (white) you can get any color you want by subtracting/absorbing red, yellow, blue (subtractive).</p>
<p>So the primary colors for subtracting light are red, yellow, blue and we use those when painting. And the primary colors for adding light are red, green, blue and we use those for computer screens and TVs. I think technically the specific shades you need to get every other color out of subtractive lighting are magenta instead of red and cyan instead of blue (and yellow is still yellow). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary colors you're thinking of are for paint, where the color <em>absorbs</em> light. This means that when you mix two pigments together, they now absorb more wavelengths. This is why when you take all the paints and mix them together, you get black.</p>
<p>Red, green, and blue, on the other hand, are for monitors, where you're actually <em>emitting</em> wavelengths. When you mix red and green together, you get more wavelengths of color coming out, not less. So when you mix them all together, you get white. </p>
<p>The reason that they use red, green, and blue is because you have three different types of color-sensing cells in your eyes, which respond to red, green, and blue wavelengths. In reality, colors are just a continuous changing of wavelengths - blue is not any more &quot;primary&quot; than purple or yellow. But the way you <em>perceive</em> colors is through differing activations of the red, green, and blue cells. A blue wavelength results in a very high activation of the blue cells and not so much of the other ones, so your mind perceives that as blue. A yellow wavelength results in medium activations of green and blue, with little red. So if we shine one green light and one blue light into your eye, your cells are activated in a way that makes you see yellow, <em>even though it's not actually yellow in any sense</em>.</p>
<p>So the really mind-blowing thing here is that if we just perceived color as a continuous value, monitors would look very strange. You wouldn't see yellow or purple - you'd just see a monitor which is a melange of red, green, and blue. We only see colors besides red, green, and blue because we're tricking our eyes, activating the cells in a way that makes them think they're looking at a different color than they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer here. I'm late to the party but I know my fair share about electromagnetic waves to chime in on the subject. </p>
<p>I just want to address one very important point that really should have been mentionned in /u/goldgibbon's comment concerning the Red/Green/Blue system in monitor and TV screens: <strong>THEY ARE A LIE</strong>. They absolutely don't make &quot;any color&quot; whatsoever, because doing so would violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle" target="_blank">superposition principle</a> of electromagnetic waves. In simple terms, this means that when adding, for example, blue and red waves, you don't get a new wave of frequency &quot;violet&quot;, you simply have red and blue added together and you see both at the same time. There is no new &quot;frequency&quot; generated.</p>
<p>The reason why we see a new color when doing this is because our eyes are kind of dumb; they have cones and rods (which are just cells responding to light) that react way more when there is red, green or blue light coming in, and so they send signals that &quot;trick&quot; our brain into seeing colors that aren't there, but in reality there are always only 3 colors on your screen. It's all just a big trick on your brain, nothing else.</p>
<p>If you're interested, I can elaborate on the subject but I really want to keep it at an ELI5 level at first. But I love to explain stuff so feel free to ask!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may be thinking of primary color <em>pigments</em>, which are cyan, magenta, and yellow (more or less, blue, red, and yellow).  Pigments are subtractive primary colors, meaning that each one you use removes a spectrum from the light that will eventually enter your eye.  Recall that white light is all of the colors, and pigments work by reflecting one spectrum and absorbing the rest.  So for instance, white light hits a shirt with red pigment.  The pigment reflects the red, but absorbs the blue and the green, so you see the red, and the shirt appears to be red.</p>
<p>If you mix, say, blue and yellow pigments, they each reflect their color and absorb most of the rest, leaving you with a mix of light that appears green.</p>
<p>But think about what this means for <em>adding</em> light spectra.  With pigments, you're starting with white and trying to get to individual colors.  With light pixels, you're starting with individual colors and trying to get to white (or other colors).  The cones in our eyes notice red, blue, and green light, and the exact pattern of activation - how much of each color - tells us what we're looking at.  So computers are adding those primary colors because that's what our eyes are looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
