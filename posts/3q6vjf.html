		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the reason stockings run is because of how the fabric is made, not because nylon is unsuitable.  Stockings are knit, it's what makes them stretchy. Knitted fabrics of any kind (stockings, socks, sweaters, etc.) all have an inherent problem which is runs. When you're hand knitting we call it a dropped stitch and it looks like this <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/faqImages/droppedStitch1.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.lionbrand.com/faqImages/droppedStitch1.jpg</a></p>
<p>For those text focused people, in knitting each stitch is part of the thread running side to side but also is holding and held by the stitch above and below it. Letting a single stitch go free to unloop will free each successive stitch above and below in it's column. </p>
<p>So for a stocking imagine this at a very small level. A single thin thread breaks, allowing the stitches below them to come free. This in turn free the stitches below them. Now stretchy nylon goes fuzzy when it's not under tension so the broken thread quickly tangles in itself and the tear stops running side-to-side but stitches above and below start working their way loose resulting in it stocking &quot;run&quot; as we think of it. <a href="http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/23319831/3/stock-photo-23319831-close-up-of-brown-stocking-or-pantyhose-with-small-run.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/23319831/3/stock-photo-23319831-close-up-of-brown-stocking-or-pantyhose-with-small-run.jpg</a></p>
<p>See the initial hole is small but the stitches above and below are coming unknit and will eventually work their way up and down the length of the stocking unless stopped.</p>
<p>So the only way to make a stocking that won't tear is to either make a thread that thin that will never break (maybe carbon nanotubes???) or invent a new kind of knitting that it stretchy but doesn't ravel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nylon stockings rip because they are super thin, nearly transparent. Before nylon stockings were made of various textiles like cotton and linen, and were worn for warmth.</p>
<p>One major difference between Nylon and natural fibers is length. Cotton fibers are typically between 3mm and 60mm long, whereas Nylon fibers can be made arbitrarily long (from a garment perspective). Thus one can make a much thinner piece of fabric using a synthetic fiber like Nylon. </p>
<p>Example: A typical cotton fiber is 10um thick, and a standard area density of thin cotton fabric is 160 g/m^2. Cotton has a density of 1650kg/m^3, so the &quot;squished&quot; thickness of the thin fabric would be around 100um. This demonstrates the cost of having short fibers, the finished piece of cloth has nearly 10 layers of fiber overlapping.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that there is another more suitable material for making stockings, but remember that suitability has engineering, aesthetic, and economic aspects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nylon stockings today are made of nylon and poly elastine blends, so there is the stretch we modern gals know and appreciate, and it's cheaper for manufacturers. Traditional nylon stockings have to be made a certain way (fully fashioned by a knitting machine on a leg form) because knit 100% nylon doesn't have much stretch. Fully fashioned stockings are expensive because there are only two or three places that use the old machines. They tend to bag bit at the knees and ankles because they stretch out with wear, unlike stockings with a bit of elastic, so I think there's a bit of an aesthetic reason we're not getting the same durability. It's the reason stretch jeans will never last as long as raw denim. Elastic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
