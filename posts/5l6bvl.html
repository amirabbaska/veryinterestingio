		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens because of the way that cell phone signals are sent.</p>
<p>The radio channels used to communicate between the handsets and the cell tower are shared among a bunch of different handsets, so they need some way to make it so that all of them can cooperate to not get all the signals mixed up.  In some cell phone protocols, the channels are split up in time, so each handset gets a small chunk of time to transmit and then has to be silent until its turn comes around again.</p>
<p>In GSM, these time slices are 4.615 milliseconds long and come in groups of 8, which they transmit a little over 27 times per second.  When they transmit, they generate a little bit of current in any unshielded wires that are nearby, like speaker wire.  While the handset is transmitting, then, it's generating a current in the speaker wire a little over 27 times per second, which ends up making the speaker produce a 27Hz buzz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cell phone is just &quot;listening&quot; to the cell network signals when it's in idle mode.</p>
<p>When someone will send you a text or calls you, the cellular network &quot;pages&quot; your phone, and your phone has to answer &quot;yup, I'm here, wassup?&quot; before the actual text is sent or call is established.</p>
<p>At this point, the phone transmits a radio signal back to the tower.</p>
<p>The first transmission is made with a relatively high power, because the system must be sure the phone signal can get to the tower. Once this first signal is received by the tower, the network measures how strong it is, and may tell the phone &quot;whoa! too loud, tone it down&quot;.</p>
<p>So it's generally at the first stage of the connection that you hear the interference; it's a higher power radio signal being tranmitted by your phone, which creates noise (not directly by the rf signal, but the switching on/off of the radio power which may happen several times a second, depending on the technology used - 2G/3G).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The noise is coming from your cell phone, rather than from the cell tower. Your phone maintains a link to the cell tower constantly but in a low power mode. When you receive a phone call or text, your mobile is polled by the tower which wakes it up to a higher power mode in order to receive and acknowledge the incoming data. It is this burst of transmission from your phone which is being picked up by speakers and other audio near the phone. </p>
<p>While the phone operates at a much higher frequency than the audio amplifier of your speakers, there are harmonics that extend far below and far above the carrier frequency, and the internal cabling in your speaker acts like an antenna and the lower frequency harmonics can become amplified, causing the chirping you hear. </p>
<p>There is enough radiative power around your cell phone to light up an LED much like Nikola Tesla's wireless power with a light bulb. If you take a diode and twist it's legs together with an LED you can hold it close to phones, microwave ovens, and wifi and the LED will light up as it acts like an antenna. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>every phone is basically a radio transmitter, and it transmits pulses of digital sound and data files to the base station (the tower) so that communication can occur. The wiring inside most speakers are not protected or shielded from this sort of frequency, and there is typically a non-linear circuit element (transistor) within a speaker that detects these high-pulse radio signals. The element in the speaker then rectifies (translates) those radio signals into audio signals, which are in turn heard in such an unpleasant way through the speaker, in addition to a lower level of the audio that had previously been playing through the speakers. For non-active speakers, this does not always occur, although there are certain types of phones that will activated unpowered speaker circuits </p>
