<p><strong>Explanation</strong> We're not entirely sure, but it seems to be that humans assume people are staring at them even when only presented with partial evidence. This was tested in an experiment by the University of Sydney, which noted that when not given sufficient cues, the subject would still almost always assume they were being watched. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> There's no accepted theory, chance?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain processes loads of information that you're not aware of. Indeed some theories of the mind posit that consciousness doesn't really exist and what we experience as consciousness is a post-facto reality.</p>
<p>So it's possible the feeling is your brain tweaking into something before you are consciously aware of it.</p>
<p>i.e. Your brain notices some eyes looking towards you before you are consciously aware of them and pulls your attention towards them.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's confirmation bias? Maybe you frequently feel watched and sometimes when you look up you actually catch someone looking?</p>
<p>I can't imagine how to design a scientific test for this supposed phenomenon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We absolutely can not feel this, we can sense it though; most people today are poorly tuned at doing it. As a rancher for many years I can tell you exactly when I'm being watched and stalked, I verify it regularly with my flashlight to noobies who think I'm trying to scare them. I will light up the area and find a set of eyes looking in our direction. </p>
<p>I do not believe it's a mind's eye thing, it must be related to my peripheral vision picking up two orbs distanced far enough apart to simulate an animal. I know this because if a deer or dog is walking parallel to me I will not &quot;sense&quot; it, I can only see one eye. I have also been walked up on from behind while working and only made aware of my stalker by audible means (extreme noise or extreme silence). </p>
<p>I should actually do a study for this on YouTube or something because I can prove it daily. I could even use sunglasses to illustrate how removing the shape of two orbs will stop you entirely getting this sense. You can however still observe someone and tell they are stalking you. You will not get the hair raiser feeling though, that is a response for your nerve endings firing up getting ready to fight. Something I have felt every time a big cat is stalking me. Really really hate mountain lions, the chaotic silence that accompanies their arrival is difficult to describe, very fun to be stalked and reminded that we are not truly the top of the food chain when we are alone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is unconscious sight. It is very unintuitive but a significant amount of seeing is done completely unconsciously.  There is a phenomenon called blindsight where people who lose the brain areas for visual sight can still do many things requiring vision, but deny being able to see anything. They think they can navigate and grab objects merely by chance or coincidence since the processing is done completely unconsciously.  The gaze detection is merely unconscious processing of danger.  I mean think about it. No one looks at their visual field and deduces consciously that they are being watched or are in danger. The danger or gaze feeling is already present in the perception.   The evolutionary advantages of this type of detection should be obvious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a very long time in our development, being watched was tantamount to being hunted.  We are predisposed to assume we are being watched (even when we aren't) because it's inexpensive and so much safer than the alternative.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
