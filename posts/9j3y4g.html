So while the enamel can become demineralized and remineralized like most hard tissues, it cannot form any new enamel whatsoever. The insulating layer just underneath (dentin) does have some slight self-healing properties but even that has severe limitations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, looks like I'm up to bat.</p>
<p>Teeth are organs that have several mechanisms by which they can restore  damage or even lost tissue. The pulp can create tertiary dentin either as a defense mechanism or a restorative measure in some cases, this includes some types of micro-fractures and abrasions.</p>
<p>The cement and enamel on the other hand, have no such direct mechanism. They are not vital tissue and have no method of &quot;reproducing&quot; or &quot;regenerating&quot; themselves.... that being said, enamel has the capacity to engage in an ongoing remineralization process in which the enamel matrix will &quot;adsorb&quot; and &quot;bond&quot; with certain minerals to create substitute for natural dental tissue (Ex: Flourhydroxyapatite) which is not &quot;regeneration&quot; or &quot;healing per se, more like crude but functional patchwork, this is one of the methods by whcih a tooth can stave off major forms of damage, by dealing with the many micro-fractures that our teeth can suffer, which can eventually lead to a full blown transverse or linear fracture.</p>
<p>All of that being said;</p>
<p>Lacerations in the skin do not fully heal or regenerate. Scar tissue is not the same as the original tissue that it substitutes.</p>
<p>Broken bones never actually &quot;heal&quot;, it's more like they settle back in place. The segmented portions will forever be weakened due to an increase in rigidity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that teeth do not regenerate whatsoever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do, just that most dental tissue simply does not have reproductive capacity or the ability to generate new dental tissue. </p>
<p>Sources: <strong>Roijas Garzas Dental Anatomy</strong>, <strong>Dental Histology and Embryology by Jose Alfonso Castillo</strong> , but tldr, I am a dentist and can confidently state that these things are true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some animals which constantly grow teeth, like sharks and rodents. But their lifestyles require continual growth because of the rate at which their teeth break or wear down. It doesn't really make sense for people because enough of our teeth will generally last through our natural lifespan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, i did some research and here's what I found: Teeth have the ablitity to heal themselves- to a certain extent. However, since 90% of the enamel consists of minerals, there's no cells which allow our teeth to repair and regenerate like bones.</p>
<p>Also, enamel is the hardest tissue - but it's not living, therefore it's unable to regenerate itself naturally. </p>
<p>Hope this somewhat helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeth aren't as exceptional as OP proposes:</p>
<p>Skin doesn't grow back, scar tissue does. Scar doesnt fulfil all the functions of skin-as-an-organ, it wont contain hair follicles or sweat glands,  it has different nerve and sensor provision etc.</p>
<p>Bone regenerates through callus formation etc., but the end product is structurally different from the original bone: paleopathologists can readily detect 'healed' bone injuries in remains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
