What's up with that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually don't dream while deeply asleep.  During the long deep restful sleep phases, your brain is in slow wave regenerative sleep and not doing all that much.  (Relatively.)</p>
<p>The dreams happen during the lighter sleep phases / REM, which are at the start and end of each sleep phase.  But your brain has no concept of elapsed time when in deep sleep, so it retroactively assumes the dreams lasted a long time and during the deepest phases.  In actually most dreams are several minutes at most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Learned this while getting my BS in neuroscience: Like other comments have suggested, REM sleep, which your brain enters during the lighter states of sleep (usually the second stage) is the stage that you dream in. It is also largely believed to be the important restorative phase. Normally when sleeping your body naturally cycles through about 4 stages descending deeper from 1-4 then ascending back up 4-1 about every hour and a half. Going directly from awake to dreaming in a nap is likely the result of your body needing sleep more than usual, in which case your body will skip the first stage and plunge itself directly into REM sleep. There could be other factors but that is one likely reason. Hope that helped. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are most likely hypnogogic hallucinations (quick dreams of falling or some other short, vivid images) unless you are seriously deprived of R.E.M. Sleep. In that case, you may be experiencing R.E.M. rebound, where you go immediately into R.E.M. sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
