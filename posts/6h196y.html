	<title>In a documentary about the Manhattan Project I recently viewed (I don't recall the name of it, I apologize), some of the scientists expressed their concern about the &quot;atmosphere exploding&quot; and destroying the Earth during the Trinity test. What scientific basis did they have for this speculation?</title>

He expressed his concern to another scientist as to the dreadful burden of his task, and the terrible consequences if he were wrong.  The other scientist (Maybe Richard Feynman, it sounds clever enough for him) said something to the effect of  &quot;Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, no one will blame you.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best I understand it, they were worried about chain-reaction fusion of low-weight atoms, like oxygen or nitrogen.</p>
<p>We know now it's impossible.  Not nearly dense enough, not enough pressure or energy, etc etc.  But keep in mind, the Manhattan Project spanned across World War II, and ended before 1945.</p>
<p>Fission [of heavy elements] was only discovered in 1938.  They were literally discovering and making stuff up as they went.  So the idea that the energies necessary weren't there wasn't something they could know until after they ran the numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
