		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different ways of rating octane. The fuel is the same. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Research Octane Number (RON)
The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.</p>
<p>Motor Octane Number (MON)
Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON.[1] MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2
In most countries, including Australia, New Zealand and all of those in Europe,[citation needed] the &quot;headline&quot; octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI), and often written on pumps as (R+M)/2). It may also sometimes be called the Posted Octane Number (PON).</p>
<p>Difference between RON, MON, and AKI
Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel's Sensitivity,[4] and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system.</p>
<p>See the table in the following section for a comparison.</p>
<p>Observed Road Octane Number (RdON)
Another type of octane rating, called Observed Road Octane Number (RdON), is derived from testing gasolines in real world multi-cylinder engines, normally at wide open throttle. It was developed in the 1920s and is still reliable today. The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.[5]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your octane numbers and our octane numbers don't mean the same thing. From an engineering perspective the octane number is actually a kind of hilariously arbitrary number that basically boils down a bunch of different fuel qualities, that all both individually <em>and</em> collectively control a fuel's likelihood to knock, all into a single number, and because of that the precise testing for octane numbers changes depending on the body doing the regulation. So it would be entirely possible for two utterly identical batches of fuel to get different octane ratings when tested by different countries.</p>
<p>However, our fuels are also slightly different, as Europe is going to have a slightly different set of additives than we get in the US, but that doesn't really account for most of the difference; the differing standards do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US octane is calculated two different ways and then averaged over those calculations (IE (rating1 + rating 2)/2).  What this does is show a &quot;lower&quot; octane rating for US gas in general compared to EU countries because in Europe they only calculate octane once (no /2).</p>
<p>As for WHY we don't make more other octane levels rather than the &quot;standard&quot; 87/89/91 is because of cost.</p>
<p>Not long ago I could go to <em>some</em> gas stations and fill up with 95 octane (Sunoco for example 20 years ago) if I so chose, but those days are long gone because no cars sold in the US require that much octane and nobody wants to spend extra money filling up with more octane than is required.</p>
<p>You CAN however go buy cans of octane boost if you choose at pretty much any auto store which advertise up to 101 octane per tank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Octane primarily deals with the ignition pressure of the fuel. Lower octane fuel will self ignite (without a spark) at lower pressure than higher octane fuel. Cars with engines that operate with high compression ratios (mostly turbo charged and otherwise high performance engines) need higher octane fuel so that the gas doesn't pre-ignite and screw up engine timing/efficiency/performance. Because if it pre-ignites the fuel in the cylinder, not all of the gas will burn off, so the exhaust mix is screwed up, which makes the sensors angry, and you use more fuel than you should, and you lose some output power. </p>
<p>As someone who has almost exclusively had German cars, and a former employee of a Volkswagen/Audi/Porsche dealer, I can tell you that there are very few German cars produced in the last 25 years or so that don't require high octane fuel, because of high compression. So this is a factor, as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not. US and Canada uses RON(Research Octane Number)to measure octane while most of the world uses AKI(Anti-Knock Index). 87RON is the same as 90AKI for a reference point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
