<p>Perhaps more relevant is the Fat Body.</p>
<p>Insects have an organ called the Fat Body. Lipids (fats) are stored here in adipocytes in the form of triglycerides (same way mammals store fat, essentially). These lipids are consumed during periods of high energy demand (like when flying), and are replenished in periods of food abundance. </p>
<p>Some insects have been shown to increase the size of the Fat Body in the winter, as a mechanism to enhance survival. Other insects (like house flies) don't seem to be able to store extra fat. </p>

<p>The most extreme example I can think of is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant" target="_blank">honeypot ant</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many insects have a part of their lifecycle dedicated to collecting and storing energy and another part where they can't collect energy, and can only live off of their stored reserves. Lots of species of moth spend their larval stage eating, then form a cocoon and emerge as an adult without a digestive system at all. Their adult stage is dedicated to mating and laying eggs, which will hatch into larvae and repeat the cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure whether you're still interested in yet another person telling you, but here I go:</p>
<p>Insects have an organ called the fat body, which is located on the ventral side of the abdomen. This is a kind of functional equivalent of the liver and is also used (as the name suggests) to store fat as an energy reserve.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we could always very clearly see the difference between fat bodies of starved vs non-starved locusts.</p>
<p>Fat isn't only stored in the fat body though. While that's the main site of storage, you can also see fat in all body cavities.</p>
<p>The reason why an insect doesn't get literally fat is because they are often filled with air sacs, filling the body cavities. When the organs grow (because of fat storage, production of eggs,...), these air sacs simply deflate and become smaller.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a large difference between insects, and logically also a large difference in the time you can starve an insect. Our locusts could easily make it two weeks without any food. Several of them would make it over a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at an Insectarium. The answer is a resounding YES. We take very good care of our arthropod guests and some of them don't get the amount of exercise they would in the wild. Currently we have an obese praying mantis, tailless whipscorpion, and centipede, just off the top of my head. </p>
<p>All arthropods have areas of membrane between their sclerites (the panels of exoskeleton) and when they have so much fat body (insects equivalent to our fat storage, it also does other things) that their sclerites aren't anywhere near touching anymore and their semens of membrane are stretched thin... they are fat. I'm pretty sure we have some that would be in the obese range if there was a scale for insects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
