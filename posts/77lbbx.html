<p>Out to sea, coveralls are the shit. Can't beat coveralls.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The colors chosen were to camouflage stains on the uniform more than the surrounding. There's a lot if gray and black so that if you got ship paint/grease on it, it wouldn't look like crap because unless you got a lot of it on you, it would be hard to notice. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The uniform was implemented to hide the gray and black stains from paint and oil that you find on ships. It had gray and black spots for this purpose. The base color was made to be blue because it looks good with the gray and black spots on the camouflage. It was also designed to block infrared light from night vision. This is a well documented fact, so any comment stating the contrary here is wrong.</p>
<p>It was intended as a working uniform, not a combat uniform. Hence the name “Naval Working Uniform”. It is not worn out to sea, so any concern with falling overboard and not being spotted is ridiculous. Furthermore, when you fall overboard your head is typically all that is visible, which means there isn’t much you can do to increase visibility. You will disappear quickly no matter what you are wearing.</p>
<p>Edit: the new Type III’s are green because they were designed for the 5% of people stationed in green areas such as Bahrain who may actually see combat. Most watch-standers stand watch on ships or on concrete and pavement roads. The type III’s miss the point of the type I’s, which was for working and hiding stains. Now we have a uniform that will only be useful 1% of the time rather than 50% of the time. Sailors don’t fight, they work. We don’t need combat camouflage, we need working camouflage. They are also worn by &quot;special forces&quot; such as Riverines and Seabees who do not serve on ships or with aviation squadrons.</p>
<p>edit2: Navy wide instruction states that no form of NWU's are authorized for wear underway. FRV's are the only authorized uniform (fire retardant coveralls). They skipped on flame protection to improve comfort, and during initial sea tests it was found they melted when exposed to high temperatures. It is now an in port working uniform.</p>
<p>edit3: Why is everyone getting on my case about Bahrain not being green? There is green around the base and its the only overseas installation I've been to where they were wearing Type III's since 2015. If it was any sort of a concern they'd be using Type II's, but they aren't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 4 different colors that are used when painting a ship (edit for clarification, the main colors a ship is painted with are deck grey, haze grey-for vertical exterior surfaces black-for entrances and exits from the exterior and interior of the ship and navy blue- for trim inside the ship. There are 3 colors that aren't used however, primer is often red or green, and the bulkheads in the interior of the ship are generally white.), and every one of those colors are represented on the NWU Type I uniform (or blueberries, or blue cammies or N-dubs or whatever other random name you can think of.) Since NWUs are an expensive uniform and often we stand watch with it, and it presents an unprofessional appearance when it has paint stains on it, whenever we paint ships these days we are allowed to wear coveralls even while in port. While we are out to sea we are only allowed to wear a special set of coveralls called FRVs which is fire retardant as opposed to NWUs which when exposed to heat melt. A large portion of the navy wears NWU type IIIs which are a light green woodland camouflage. I joined the Navy 5 years ago and at the time the top ranking officers were complaining about how many uniforms we have and NWU type Is. In boot camp I was told not to get to attached to my NWUs because they were &quot;phasing&quot; them out. 5 years ago. Well as of November 6th this year, my entire command will officially only allow Type IIIs, and I don't remember the exact date, but I believe as of October next year, navy wide NWU Type Is will be gone.
Edit* The exact date is October 1st 2019</p>
<p>Also I saw some posts about having to buy our own uniforms. We are given a uniform allowance once a year on the same month as our navy ADSD (Active Duty Start Date) and it is meant for maintenance of uniforms. Basically they give you enough money to replace all of your working uniforms over the course of 4 years. However, we also have to pay for many alterations and changes to our dress uniforms (unless you're good at sewing or know someone who is) as well as replacing dress uniforms which are extremely expensive. Often times when pulling into port we will do what is called line handlers (the mooring lines that hold the ship in place while in port have to be manually tensioned by a team of around 6 sailors.) And we have to do them in dress whites or dress blues depending on the season. That wreaks havoc on that uniform, and one time doing line handlers in dress whites-you will never use that uniform for anything else ever again. So yes we do get some money to pay for our uniforms, but unless you are really good at making sure you don't mess your uniforms up, it won't be enough. Also paying for an entire new set of uniforms with the introduction of Type IIIs, we still only get our usual uniform allowance. Edit* I was wrong, I just got my uniform allowance last month actually and I hadn't seen a change in the amount, but there is an instruction saying that it will be increased. So that is probably an issue with my own personal pay, and not navy wide.</p>
<p>Edit: also to clarify how the camouflage works, digital camouflage isn't for keeping yourself from being seen during the day (for the  navy, for other branches it is). Its more specifically intended to blur your outline at night against night vision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
