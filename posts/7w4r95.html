		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currents in wind and water as well as birds carry all kinds of seeds over 100s and 1000s of km. Remote islands might be way stations on further flights of birds. What they carry in their feathers or stomaches can seed. This is no different from land based vegetation, that often also has its seeds carried by animals to further away places.</p>
<p>Soil is also carried with wind and water and as soon as any vegetation can hold root (means stuff starts to grow and die), for examble in fertile volcanic ash, you can have more diverse soil form over a longer time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three basic ways that life gets to remote islands.</p>
<p><strong>By air</strong> -- stuff just blows in the wind to the island.  All sorts of bacteria, protists, fungi, etc. have spores that can blow in the wind, as well as a insects, birds, and some plant seeds.</p>
<p><strong>By sea</strong> -- stuff from one island can wash into the sea, get carried by ocean currents, and wash up on a new island.  This works for many plant seeds and stems, and a few small animals, provided they can tolerate seawater.</p>
<p><strong>By hitchhiking</strong> -- A bird might eat some seeds on one island, fly to a new island, and poop them out.  A frog or worm might live in a rotten log that gets washed out to sea and washes up on a new island.  Etcetera.</p>
<p>This definitely puts a limit on the kinds of different life forms that can inhabit new islands.  For instance, I grew up on Hawaii: before humans showed up, the islands had no mammals on land except seals and bats.  But small plant and animal seeds and soil bacteria had no problem making the journey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rocks break down into sand.
Sand breaks down into silt.
Silt breaks down into clay.
Organic matter comes from dead plants and animals.
The process is continual. Soil forming at the base of a mountain talus slope is essentially &quot;new&quot; and many soils are 10,000 - 100,000-500,000 years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
