		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For distant stars and galaxies, there's some highly educated guesswork based on apparent speed and brightness, but for closer ones, there's actually a really intuitive method called <strong>parallax</strong>!</p>
<p>It works like this: suppose there's some distant object like a mountain that you want to know the distance to. Notice that as you walk sideways, closer objects like trees appear to pass you much faster than the mountain. This is the parallax effect.</p>
<p>To use it mathematically, simply measure how far you walked, and how far you had to rotate your head to keep the mountain in view. Now the start point, end point, and the mountain itself form a triangle, of which you know the measure of one side and two angles. Using trigonometry, this is enough information to determine the remaining sides, which are the distance between you and the mountain! </p>
<p>It would be difficult to walk far enough on earth to see a measurable change in the location of a star, but we can &quot;walk&quot; the entire earth just by waiting 6 months for it to be on the opposite side of its orbit. This enables us to calculate the position of nearby stars, without actually going to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically as light begins to reach great distences, we can begin to measure it source through a system called parallax, by which we identify an object and then measure it about 6 months later because relitivly we are the only thing to have moved in this method. Then we can you geometry, to determine the angles to with fairly good accuracy to determine the length of the sides of the triangle we made, with modern science we can measure it difrently but I don't know how, this method is just what we used in my astronomy class to explain how we have been able to measure things like distences to stars for a very long time.</p>
<p>Their are probably misspellings or an error somewhere and this is just from memory from an semester astronomy course I had 2 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top post covered parralax well , but it looks like there isn't a good explanation of red shifting. </p>
<p>From an earlier post, you seem to understand the doppler effect and how it relates to velocity. </p>
<p>From parralax, we know that further away galaxies are moving away from us faster. If we assume this holds, we can model the universe is expanding and the rate of that expansion is increasing. If we know that light from farther away galaxies take longer to get here, we know that farther away galaxies are older (than we see them now). </p>
<p>Older parts of the universe are redshirting more than younger parts and we can confirm this with <em>standard candles. </em></p>
<p>A standard candles is a term for a super nova (or other physical event) that has a fixed luminosity due to the nature of the event. If it has a given apparent brightness, we can know how far away it is from another means. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers in here, but there is one that doesn't seem to be well covered yet. Specifically, supernovas.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of supernova, but there is one in particular that is helpful in judging distances. It is a type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova" target="_blank">Ia</a> supernova.  This occurs when you have a binary star system that has a white dwarf and a red super giant star.  In this scenario the white dwarf is siphoning mass off the red super giant.  Eventually this start exceeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit" target="_blank">Chandrasekhar limit</a> and creates a supernova.</p>
<p>This is helpful because we know very specifically how much mass is required to make this occur, and the circumstances in which it occurs. Thus we know how bright the supernova <em>should</em> be. You see, there is a law called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">Inverse square law</a> that measures how much intensity light will lose over a given distance. If we know how bright the explosion was, we can measure how bright the light we received was and then use the inverse square law to get a reasonable estimate of distance.</p>
<p>Edit: It is important to note that multiple types of measurements are made to judge the distance of a star.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YYTgENyJxs" target="_blank">Hoberman</a> sphere is a good example of how intensity of light is lost. If you think of a star in terms of a hoberman sphere, you can think of photons like the points on the hoberman sphere. In the case of the star however, the points have near infinite density. Even with near infinite density, a light year is a LOOOOOOONG way to travel. Even a near infinitesimal difference in angle becomes noticeable as you travel light years. As you travel 1000 light years, the density of photos will have dropped rather dramatically. This makes the star look dimmer than it actually is.  This is one of the reasons why satellites use long exposure times when photographing space.  You are literally waiting for the information (photons) to collect. Telescopes act like huge light buckets that catch more of these photons in order to re-focus them into intelligible pictures.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the &quot;black spot&quot; in space that scientists pointed the Hubble telescope at. To our instruments it appeared to be devoid of anything which is very, very, unusual. So they redirected Hubble to point at this spot and hold it's shutter open for 100 hours.  What they found after this was a huge number of galaxies.  They are simply so far away that not many of the photons reach us. <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/24/when-hubble-stared-at-nothing-for-100-hours/" target="_blank">Link here for the curious</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
