		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can kinda answer this, as I studied play behaviors in wild animals. My primary focus was on social play behaviors. I'm running with the assumption that you're defining play, or &quot;hobbies&quot;, as a non normal behavior. With that, the following explanation works.</p>
<p>To put it simply, it really depends. Seemingly non functional behaviors (such as play) vary from species to species. Some species play a lot, while some never or hardly play at all. Some species only play during their juvenile stage and some play into adulthood. If you look at most play behaviors, they tend to mimic necessary behaviors such as feeding, hunting, escape, or help reinforce social bonds among individuals. The primary thought is that play can serve as a way to prepare or practice for real world situations. For example, running, jumping, and climbing help with motor control which could be needed to run away from danger or catch prey.</p>
<p>Play shouldn't be confused with stress related behaviors. Some repetitive behaviors are not play or &quot;hobbies&quot;. For example, an animal in a zoo without any enrichment programs may pace the same area back and forth. This isn't because the animal is enjoying it, but because the animal is stressed and bored.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that play still isn't super well understood. In some species we can see a link between play and skills obtained but there are many cases where we're still left scratching our heads, trying to figure out what benefit it provides, if any.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, let me know if you have more questions!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, yes. Often animals will develop abnormal, even self-harming behaviours when placed under inadequate housing conditions. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3228921/" target="_blank">self-biting is commonly reported in Macaques living in solitary enclosures</a>.</p>
<p>There are also many redirected behaviours in which an animal performs a normal behaviour on an inappropriate target. Cross-sucking is common in weaning calves, as they are trying to mimic the suckling of the mother's teat.</p>
<p>Stereotypies are another category of commonly observed abnormal behaviours, in which the animal performs some repetitive activity with no obvious goal or function. Examples include crib-biting in horses, pacing in carnivores and birds, &quot;backflipping&quot; in rodents. While there is ample evidence that the occurrence of these stereotypical behaviours are indicative of poor animal welfare, there is also emerging theories that these behaviours do in fact serve a beneficial function. For example, bar-biting in horses has been shown to increase saliva production, and may be associated with high stomach acidity as occurs in high-grain diets and pathological conditions such as stomach ulcers (saliva is rich in buffering agents that would lower acidity). There is also evidence that performing these behaviours serves to improve the animal's emotional states, so it is somewhat analogous to someone who chews their nails when anxious.</p>
<p>More to these stereotypical behaviours is the fact that even when there is a known causal effect, such as animals pacing in small or isolated enclosures, these behaviours will often continue to persist even if the cause is later removed or fixed. So, these behaviours are kind of a scar from previously inadequate conditions. Younger animals  are most susceptible to developing permanent abnormal behaviours because of their developmental status, but sometimes these behaviours are learned instead of developed, often by imitating another animal that performs these behaviours.</p>
<p>Regarding &quot;hobbies&quot;, yes, play is a very common thing in young animals too. Examples include cats playing with their prey (the mother will encourage and train the kittens to hunt, then play with the prey itself to normalize the kittens to certain kinds of prey; and in adulthood the cats are more likely to hunt that particular prey type); perhaps most commonly recognized, fetching and rough-housing in dogs (teaches social norms and promotes group activities); running and bucking in calves, especially when turned out onto summer pastures after a long winter. Play is generally regarded as an indicator for good animal welfare, and various studies have shown benefits on development of social structures and adult behaviours. However, even into adulthood we will still see play in less domesticated animals (since cats and dogs are to some extent bred to maintain those playful behaviours, its unfair to use them as the decisive indicator).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
