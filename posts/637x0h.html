Do these benefits spill over into everyday life?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://doc.renlearn.com/KMNet/R001183027GDA763.pdf" target="_blank">Patterns of Reading Practice 1996 by Terrance D. Paul</a> practicing reading is the number one predictor of school performance and standardized test scores, beating socioeconomic status and parental education. Reading seems to be the brain's equivalent of weight training - you don't have to lift a lot of weight, but you have to practice it regularly and you'll get tremendous academic gains.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn't sound that surprising when you consider that reading is done in basically every class. Being good at it because you have practiced doing it isn't that surprising either - practice a sport, an instrument, etc. and you'll get better and it will be easier, and eventually it will be fun rather than a chore. Doing something beneficial when it is also fun compounds the gains.</p>
<p>Extensive reading is going to expose people to more words, which allows for understanding on another level - if you lack the word for something, then you can't have as many subtleties of meaning. Reading an hour a day will expose you to 4 million words per year. So vocabulary building is an essential benefit of reading, that is applicable in a variety of ways to learning.</p>
<p>Reading allows people to experience things vicariously - reading <em>Into Thin Air</em> will allow you to climb Mt. Everest from your armchair. Reading allows communication of knowledge, philosophy, etc. in ways that allow for re-reading, allowing comprehension that could be missed in seeing a video, lecture, etc. that happens and is gone. Going further, taking notes, writing in the book, figuring out just what the author is getting at and the devices they're using to get there can allow for a more complete understanding. There is a denseness in the highly literate work that would lead to confusion in a TV show, where the expectation is that it will be seen once and be gone. Reading can be slower and more deliberate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel these points just support the idea of a cognitive benefit to reading but don't really say why 'reading' and why not another medium.
Reading is the only way of absorbing information that is truly at your own pace. </p>
<p>You can read and reread a passage of text as many times as required until you understand. Sure, you can rewind video or audio but not nearly as easily of elegantly as you can with reading. </p>
<p>Because of this quality, the content of things that are 'written' can be vastly more complex and detailed, meaning that those who read a lot are more likely to encounter such content.</p>
<p>If you think about it, every piece of content that has extreme significance and or complexity in society is written down - and I don't think it's a just tradition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading, fiction or non fiction, is an experience of being in another person's head. Reading thoughts from others are understood in our brains unlike a tv show where we usually only see the actors actions rather than thoughts. Studies on reading fiction has shown that readers have a better ability to have empathy and in turn allows better insights to how others act and feel.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading, unlike passively watching tv shows and movies, requires more activity from the brain. Like working a muscle, the more of a mental task you do the easier it becomes to do it again. Reading exercises your linguistic (and many other) skills making regular readers better able to understand new words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Increases verbal/writing skills</p>
<p>2) Helps articulate thoughts - Reading improves your vocabulary and makes you a more creative thinker.</p>
<p>3) Enhances problem solving skills - The structure of fiction—with a beginning, middle and end—trains the brain to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance.</p>
<p>4) Increases concentration - Reading is more demanding on your brain than processing images or speech. This neurobiological workout keeps your brain sharp, and improves powers of concentration.</p>
<p>5) Improves memory - Modern life bombards us with too much information, which we learn to tune out. Reading reduces stress by allowing your brain to focus on one task.</p>
<p>6) Reading improves the relaxation response, lowering heartbeat and pulse rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
