		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a lot less strictly defined that one might imagine. Every team is different, but the general breakdowns are:</p>
<p>Studios provide resources (locations, gear, access to people) and financing. The waters are muddied substantially when they insist on creative control to go with said financing and additional resources.</p>
<p>Producers handle the logistics of actually getting the thing off the ground. They will (with outsourcing where necessary) generally get everything going. Hire the right people, set up the meetings. They're like the manager of the shoot. Their job is to make sure everything is ready to go for everyone ELSE to do their jobs. Kinda like how a music producer might get two or more musicians, some writers and a really great recording studio to all collaborate on a track... they produce it. They got everyone together.</p>
<p>Directors are the person at the helm of the creative ship. They work within constraints set by the producer and the big money people, but they are there to make sure a cohesive vision and style get stuck to.</p>
<p>Sometimes directors also produce and visa versa. Sometimes they exec-produce their own produce their own projects too. It's a pretty hazily defined job spec and literally can change on every project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using a restaurant as a loose metaphor, the studio would be the bank or rich friend that finances the restaurant.</p>
<p>The producer would be the restaurant manager who was helpful in finding a suitable loan from the bank or is buddies with the rich investor. May also be a personal investor themselves. Runs the numbers, has financial ties to the project, and usually has control of minutiae.</p>
<p>The director is the chef hired to create the menu that will be what defines the restaurant.</p>
<p>Sometimes a chef can also be the restaurant manager, which is why they also get producer credits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally when making a movie, the Studio has the money.  They're paying for everything, own and/or rent the equipment.  They lose the money or make the money.  This is not to be confused with a distributor, who makes sure that the movie gets to places where people can see it.</p>
<p>The Director is in charge of the &quot;artistic vision&quot; of the movie by determining what goes into the film.  They pick the shots that the DP or cameraperson uses.  They coax the right performance from the actors.  They interpret the screenplay.   They have the &quot;glamorous&quot; job.  There are different types of directors who handle other responsibilities, but that isn't important now.</p>
<p>The Producer, that's the fun job.  And by fun, I mean aggravating, stressful, insane, frantic, and psychotic.  The producer's job is to make sure that the Director can do their job with the least amount of stress possible while balancing the needs of the Studio.  They are in charge of every aspect of the film, from location scouting to catering to hiring the staff and actors.  A large movie will have multiple producers, and department heads that report to these producers.</p>
<p>It's a similar breakdown for TV shows and other media, but in those fields, the Director is less important for artistic vision.  That's where the Show Runner comes in.  They're usually a Producer/Director hybrid who is in charge of the overall story, while a different Director is brought in for each episode.  There is a lot of work that goes in to all of these jobs for a movie, but the Director has a harder job week to week than the Producers or Studio.  Think of it like this:  For a TV show like Doctor Who, the Producers put together a budget per show for the season, and a budget for the whole season.  Some sets and locations are going to be used several times throughout the year to save time.  The Producers and Show Runners put together the story arcs, and pick Directors for each episode, while they give the Studio the budget.  The Studio gives the Producers the money, equipment, and access they need while the Production Staff gets to work making things work for the whole season.  The Writers will write the episodes, about 1 per week, and the first few Directors will get started on the setup.  They'll work with and fight with the Producers on what can and can't be done per episode, then the Director will spend a month working on their pre-production, and about a week shooting the episode.  The next Director follows along a week later, and so on and so on, until the end of the season.  After each episode is shot, it goes to Post-Production for editing, effects, and other stuff.</p>
<p>I've done some limited work with all three of these spots, and my favorite of them was where the action was.  It's a flippant answer, but I enjoyed the stress and panic of doing it all.  I enjoyed having to crunch the numbers to see if we could afford to shoot in the abandoned bank, or if we'd need to rewrite the script to omit an overly expensive scene.  I loved making the production schedule, breaking down everything into logical blocks.  If we had a house for a day and needed to shoot five scenes at different times of the year, how do we do it?  What differences in the characters and location need to be tracked?  Do we REALLY need the Bentley for this shot, or will the Caddy work?  For directing, I loved the fact that I was making people give me the reactions I want for the shot, and that anything goes.  They're like puppets with pulses.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
