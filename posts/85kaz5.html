		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All great apes build sleeping platforms, and a pillow can be seen as part of that. Because it is common to all great apes, it is likely that the desire for a comfortable sleeping platform has existed since before each great ape species parted ways with one another in prehistory. Compare this with monkeys who usually sleep upright and sleep very lightly, whereas great apes all sleep very deep and while laying down on their beds. And if you catch an ape taking an afternoon nap away from their bed(pretty common really), you will likely find them laying on their sides, using their hands or some leaves/brush as a makeshift pillow</p>
<p>Chimp beds for example take on the form of an oval bowl, which naturally forms a pillow(the key part of a pillow is not that it is fluffy, but that it allows your neck to rest in a natural position). I took a nap on an abandoned bed while I was doing observations at Chinko reserve in southeast CAR and I can confirm that, while not luxurious, they are quite comfy. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer, as far as I can tell, is that we don’t know for certain. What we know about the development of pillows and bedding, however, suggests a few options. </p>
<p>I found this site which details the history of the pillow. </p>
<p><a href="http://hankeringforhistory.com/pillows-throughout-the-ages-guest-post/" target="_blank">http://hankeringforhistory.com/pillows-throughout-the-ages-guest-post/</a></p>
<p>The oldest known pillows date back around 9,000 years and are made of carved stone. The shape suggests suggests an attempt at providing comfort...a smooth surface is much better for laying your head on, after all, than a rough one. It’s also been suggested by historians that pillows like this protected people from bugs. It’s possible, therefore, that cavemen used nearby rocks to keep their heads elevated. </p>
<p>This is not, however, the oldest known bedding. That dates back 77,000 years and consists of compressed grass, leaves, and plant stems found at archaeological site called the Sidubu Cave. Interestingly, the specific plants they found in the bedding served as natural insecticides, suggesting that protection from bugs was at the front of mind due cavemen as it was for ancient Egyptians. It’s possible a mound of this material was used on top of the bedding as a makeshift pillow. Here is the study. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/earliest-human-beds-found-south-africa" target="_blank">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/earliest-human-beds-found-south-africa</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the Japanese Geisha have used wooden blocks with cushioning on top to serve as a pillow. These blocks allowed them to protect their elaborate hair styles while sleeping. A log or other piece of wood, therefore, is a potential third option for cavemen pillows. </p>
<p>In the case of rocks and pillows, there’s no reason grass and leaves couldn’t have been used as a softer barrier to increase comfort. We wouldn’t know that, however, since such technology wouldn’t necessarily register with archaeologists if it wasn’t shaped or processed on some way such as to distinguish it from other debris. </p>
<p>Edit: the rocks are no longer imprisoned. TIL proofreading matters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of relevant; a really fascinating thing in Nelson Mandela’s biography is when he describes sleeping on a mattress and experiencing pillows for the first time when he was a boy. The way he talks about it is so insane to me because I have always had such luxuries.</p>
<p>Edit* It’s from his book: A Long walk to freedom</p>
<p>Can’t be bothered with finding the part where he describes sleeping with pillows but here is a passage that alludes to it</p>

<p>Also, I believe I remember reading somewhere that ancient egyptians used a wood or stone platform as a pillow: <a href="https://vanwinkles.com/where-did-throw-pillows-come-from" target="_blank">https://vanwinkles.com/where-did-throw-pillows-come-from</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t and we did not evolve to “need” pillow.</p>
<p>In many cultures throughout history people have not had pillows or pillows were only for the elite. In the middle ages in Europe they were seen as a sign of weakness and went out of favor, for example. Only pregnant women used them. In cultures that sleep in hammocks they don’t use pillows (used by Mayan for over 1500 years). Pillows became a high status thing in late medieval Europe.</p>
<p>People in most of human history (and in many places still today) probably slept very differently than we do today. The !Kung (northwest Botswana ) sleep on a skin or sometimes just on the sandy ground. The Efe ( Zaire ) people sleep on thinly strewn leaves or perched between two logs. The Hiwi (Venezuela) use hammocks. None of these nomads use pillows or coverings. The more settled people such as the Gebusi (Paupau New Guinea) sleep on platforms made of wood strips and throw a barkcloth cape over their torso at night.</p>
<p>It may be that the reason that many traditional people do without bedding is to avoid exposure to fleas and lice. The introduction of blankets in highland Papua New Guinea was associated with a dramatic increase in asthma among adults, probably due to infestations of house mites in the blankets.</p>
<p>The question supposes a very common mistake. That is that the way you live is universal. It is not. Towns and cities are no more than 10,000 years old. People lived other ways for hundreds of thousands of years. Even today the range of how people live is really much bigger than you would suppose. There should be a standard Quora bot response for the many questions that assume that the way life has been for 150 or 50 years is universal and for all time.</p>
<p>Even among cultures that use pillows some would not seem like pillows to you. Ceramic, wood, and stone have been used as “pillows”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
