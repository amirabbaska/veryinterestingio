		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The twists reduce the &quot;magnetic flux&quot; caused by magnetic fields in the environment, reducing interference.</p>
<p>Nearby electrical circuits will cause fluctuating magnetic fields in the region of the cable.  These fields will create an &quot;induced voltage&quot; in the cable circuit: the induced voltage depends on the magnetic flux, which is the number of field lines which poke through the gap between the two strands.  This induced voltage will interfere with the signal.</p>
<p>So clearly you want the two strands close together to minimize the gap, but because of their physical size and insulation, you can only get them so close together.</p>
<p>But if the wires cross over each other, the magnetic field pokes through in one direction for the first half-twist, then pokes through &quot;backwards&quot; for the other half-twist, and so on: each half-twist cancels out the previous one, so the total magnetic flux is much closer to zero.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an ethernet cable (or any wire) runs next to a run of power cables, the power cables will induce current into the ethernet cable. This is similar to the way that an inductive, or wireless, charger works for your phone.</p>
<p>If your ethernet cable is not twisted, there's going to be one that is closer to the power cable, therefore getting more induced current. If they are twisted, the power cable will induce current more current to one wire, then the other, then back to the first... eventually averaging out so both wires in the twisted pair have the same amount of inducted current.</p>
<p>The signal on the wire is the difference between the voltages on the 2 wires, rather than an absolute voltage. There are good reasons for this, relating to ground state differences, but that's for another time. The important thing is the devices are looking for the difference in voltage between the 2 wires.</p>
<p>All this comes together to mean that the twists cause any added current to be added equally to both sides, thereby not corrupting the signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Twisted strand uses the transmission of electricity to cancel out the noise in the cable.</p>
<p>Without the twist the cable is more sensitive to interference and generally can cause transmission issues with reduced speed due to errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because moving ambient electromagnetic fields induce electrical current in wires.  Current  that's not your signal.</p>
<p>Twisted pair makes two wires with opposite directions, making outside interference mostly cancel itself out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright so I'm going to make an attempt at an <em>actual</em> ELI5:</p>
<p>Let's say you have two long roads right next to each other (a single pair). And there's no way for cars to go from one side, to the other side. These cars spell a word from front to back, so they need to stay in the order they're in. </p>
<p>It's also crab mating season, so all the little crabs want to come onto land to breed. This means they have to cross the roads (outside interference). </p>
<p>If we keep the roads as is, the crabs will flood the road, and cars will have to stop, they might crash, they might get passed by cars on the other side which will get to the end before them, messing everything up.</p>
<p>BUT, if we add &quot;S&quot; turns into each road for the whole length(the twists in the pair), so they overlap creating many intersections, something cool happens: When crabs flood one side of the road, the cars can just split off to the other side. BUT THEN BOOM, MORE CRABS ON THAT SIDE! But it's cool, there's another intersection and we can just veer back to the other side and go around these crabs too!</p>
<p>We don't want no crabs affecting our perfect line of cars. Twists keep the crabs from affecting what's happening on the roads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
