		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any direct evidence but I would assume no, based on the following reasoning: losing the part of the visual cortex that allow you to see colour (eventually) makes you unable to imagine colour. More generally, mental imagery activates the same parts of the cortex that are activated through corresponding perception/action (but weaker). There are both imaging studies and reaction time studies to show this. So since there is no possibility for imagery, your dreams would probably be visionless if you lost your (entire) visual cortex.</p>
<p>However! Sometimes partial damage to the occipital lobe is associated with people who are in fact cortically blind, but still claim/believe that they can see!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>by definition, if you're in a coma you are unconscious i.e. not dreaming.</p>
<p>as for dreams with visual cortex damage: there's been no systematic study of this, possibly because every patient is different and would report different things. but also because, i guess, the right people haven't gotten together to collect the data?</p>
<p>i have worked with a number of hemianopia patients (blind in half the visual field due to primary visual cortex lesion), and talked with them about their experience including dreaming. most thought that their dreams were similar to their waking experience; I think one or two believed they could see more in their dreams. a problem there is that, with cortical blindness (even with retinal blindness) it is difficult or impossible to &quot;see what you can't see&quot; - everything may actually look normal, and yet you keep walking into furniture and bumping into doorframes. so it would probably be very difficult (but not impossible) to get convincing data about this question from a dreamer.</p>
<p>that said, considering that visual cortex is the substrate of visual experience, you would have to expect <em>some part</em> of visual experience to be missing in a cortically-blind dreamer. what part, exactly, can be guessed by the ostensible function of a brain region, but it's never really that simple...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Aparently visual memory only stays for about 7/8 years after becoming blind (at least that's what I believe she says).
So probably it depends on how long you've been blind for?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments say nay, but I vividly remember, watching a program about a born blind painter who can paint perspective. </p>
<p>Eşref Armağan was born blind but is a successful painter. The odd thing about him is that when he paints his visual cortex lights up even though he's never seen anything. Researchers put him in an MRI and scanned while he painted. IIRC the TV show was about people with super powers (not those kind)... A man who doesn't feel cold, a woman with synesthisia, a blind painter (Eşref Armağan)....</p>
<p>There is a case study on it <a href="http://brain.huji.ac.il/publications/Amedi_et_al_blind-painter_BRES08.pdf" target="_blank">http://brain.huji.ac.il/publications/Amedi_et_al_blind-painter_BRES08.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The painter also has a Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eşref_Armağan" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eşref_Armağan</a>  </p>
<p>So that is to say they jury is likely out it. Anecdotally, there are many reports of people who vividly real coma dreams, live other lives entirely. I think since there is such a variation of genetics, there are likely people who are blind either from eyes or damage visual cortex, who can &quot;see&quot; in their dreams. Maybe not as we do but in some form or another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
