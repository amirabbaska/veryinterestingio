And maybe I have rose tinted glasses but it feels like games like halo reach or some of the older cod's had good graphics and split screen, and I mean we all know how fast cod pumps out games so it's not like they sacrificed getting the game out on time to allow my brother and I to get top of the leaderboards on cod zombies </p>
<p>Edit: I meant most people commenting don't live with siblings currently or don't have any. I in no way mean that most people are single children. My comment was poorly worded. My bad </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 Main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It takes a lot of extra processing power to generate the split screen aspect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its development work they would rather put towards their more lucrative multiplayer (usually with microtransactions)</p>
</li>
<li>they sell more copies of the games to groups of friends who want to play it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now all of those are horseshit reasons, and I want my couch coop back, but still. I would (and do) support games with couch coop, like borderlands, lovers in a dangerous spacetime, speedrunners, etc. I recommend you do the same.</p>
<p>Also fuck Halo 5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The downfall of splitscreen is actually quite complicated. Somewhere between the 6th and 7th generation once Online Multiplayer became extremely popular, it suddenly became acceptable to make a game without splitscreen. This happened around 2010, once games could only have online multiplayer and not get punished for it since by that point most people didn't seem to care as much. The only system really exempt from this seemed to be the Wii since it focused on the family demographic that made splitscreen popular in the first place. Once the current generation rolled around, splitscreen seemingly became a relic of the past. People sort of accepted that the only way to play with others was through online in many games and many developers used this fact to make shortcuts on development. This is the reason why franchises who had been previously known for splitscreen multiplayer don't currently feature it, since online multiplayer has become almost unanimously accepted by major game developers as the new way of creating multiplayer in games. It's quite honestly a shame, since nobody wants to buy multiple systems and copies of a game to play with friends, or drag their setup over in order to play locally, but game developers will often use any shortcuts they can to cut out on development time (as a current indie dev, I can say that I'm guilty of this too.) Many features just have to be scrapped due to budget or performance concerns, especially if a developer doesn't necessarily have the time to optimize a game properly for a specific system or in general due to time limits, budget limits, or scope of a game. Games these days often times push the graphical limits of a console, especially since graphics are one of the biggest factors in both the current console wars, and also between game developers, who try to push out their fancy new 4k graphics in order to try and get your money rather than their competitors. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Since online gaming has become accepted as a standard for multiplayer on current generation consoles, many developers don't add in splitscreen multiplayer in order to reduce development time, or to avoid having to optimize the game to run smoothly on all systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core of it is that it takes at least twice the computing power to render two separate viewpoints, and simulate the physics, AI, etc for those separate viewpoints. Additionally, it takes extra memory and invalidates some &quot;hacks&quot; that work when you only have one viewpoint.<br />
This means that it's a lot more work to render two viewpoints than it is to render just one.<br />
It's a lot of work for graphics programmers. They have to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Remove hacks while maintaining framerate</li>
<li>Find the memory to render multiple viewpoints</li>
<li>Figure out how to swap to cheaper assets and rendering techniques</li>
<li>Figure out how to render split-screen with whatever new, cutting-edge PBR/HDR/deferred techniques your game is running, and make it work on whatever potato Marketing has decided your min-spec is.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a lot of work for gameplay programmers. They have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove hacks while maintaining framerate</li>
<li>Help designers with AI issues. Things like an aggro system and limiters for AI numbers</li>
<li>Help designers with scripting issues</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a lot of work for artists. They have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build cheaper versions of the assets. Generally this is done already when they author LODs, but they have to make sure the LODs hold up close to the player</li>
<li>This step applies to nearly everything in the game - meshes, textures, explosions, etc...</li>
<li>Optimize the game for double-rendering. This means going through the game and tagging things to not show up at all in split-screen. This part is crazy time-consuming.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a lot of work for designers. They have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure AI works with two+ player characters.</li>
<li>Make sure scripting works with two+ characters. What happens when one guy runs ahead and triggers a cutscene, for example?</li>
<li>Make sure pickups and items read well in smaller windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this while Marketing is complaining that the game looks worse in splitscreen and Production is changing the end goal and redefining what &quot;game&quot; means.  </p>
<p>Once all this work is done, Marketing looks at the numbers of people playing splitscreen and decides it's not worth doing all this work on the next game.<br />
