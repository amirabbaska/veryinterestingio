		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve worked with instruments that require a similar adjustment to visual perception. There is no transition period. It’s like flipping a switch. One moment you see the world wrong then suddenly it is right. If you do it repeatedly you get faster till you can put the lenses on and blink once. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got my first pair of varifocals recently and they have a similar thing, so it may shed some light.</p>
<p>For two full days I was constantly moving my head around to get the thing I was looking at in focus through the right part of the lens. The optician even said &quot;you'll be a nodding donkey for a while&quot; and she was right. Because the lens power varies continuously across the lens in both directions there are <em>no</em> straight lines and only a small area that actually works for what your looking at.</p>
<p>For the first day I even had to take them off occasionally while nascent motion sickness went away.</p>
<p>When I woke up on the third morning and put them on I thought I'd picked up the wrong glasses, everything was just in focus wherever I looked.</p>
<p>They were the right varifocal glasses though. Even more interestingly (to me at least) if I try to <em>make</em> the image go out of focus or warped I can't do it.</p>
<p>I only ever see the warping effect (that I couldn't get rid of for the first two days) out of the corner of my eye maybe once every couple of days, and it's one of those things that goes away instantly if you try to look at it harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 1950's, Theodor Erismann did experiments that took him about 8 days to fully adapt to upside down vision.  </p>
<p>More recent experiments showthatyour brain starts to change immediately and make adjustments.  </p>
<p>Experiments where someone's vision is completely obscured show that after 3 days, the areas of the brain responsible for vision are already being used for non-visual tasks.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of experiments on this but I would suggest a search on prism goggles.  They also have ones that shift your visualfield to the right or left.  I saw a pair once that used mirrors so you could only see behind you.</p>
<p>If you start at 11:30 in this video it talks about some experiments being done, but the whole show is good.  <a href="https://youtu.be/C8k-lrJrldw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/C8k-lrJrldw</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
