		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To slow the grid frequency, every generator on the entire grid would need to slow at the exact same rate, but since not ever generator has the same output power/overload capabilities this wouldn't be the case. If the generators are out of phase (which is guaranteed if they're at different speeds) large fault currents begin to flow between the generators to try and pull them back in sync and things start to trip and go offline.</p>
<p>If they were all slowed in sync somehow, then every standard AC (induction) motor would also slow down to match, since line powered induction motors (pumps, tools, large fans, etc) rotate at about the same speed as the grid's generators. Also, the impedance of all the transformers/power factor correction equipment/etc would change and it would alter how much power the grid could supply, losses at substations, and a few other details.</p>
<p>Edit: Read some of the replies to this comment as well. Some are quite insightful and clarify some hand waviness I included.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frequency is more important than people think because every transformer is built for the frequency of the alternating current. The iron core contains enough iron to &quot;saturate&quot; at the speed of polarity change, which is the optimum iron/winding ratio of the transformer. Lowering the frequency results in excessive electromagnetic saturation, too much current and heat buildup. A transformer meltdown is likely, and a house fire can be the result. So its extremely important to keep the voltage at 60hz. European transformers run at 50hz and are not interchangeable with 60hz transformers. Well maybe in a pinch. It should be noted here that using a 50hz transformer on 60hz current will be much safer than the other way around, because it will never reach saturation. The reason is that the ideal 50hz transformer contains more iron than 60hz current can ever saturate. The higher the frequency the less iron a transformer needs, though I am not sure if modern mass produced transformers are optimized enough to care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that the majority of generators can’t operate outside their designed frequency by more than a few fractional hz without sustaining major damage.  The link below is a technical paper but pages 389 and 390 describe the effects of over and under frequency on traditional turbines.  My understanding is that the time limits mentioned are lifetime limits (i.e. the damage is cumulative across separate events) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest part has been addressed by people already, which is that generators are designed to rotate at specific RPMs. Most generators rotate at 3600 RPM. To convert RPM to Hz, you divide by 60 (at least for a two pole generator, which the majority are) so 3600 directly translates to 60hz. When you drift outside of the frequency bandwidth you are changing the RPMs of the generator which can cause resonance and vibration that damage the turbine blades. </p>
<p>In light of this, the grid is covered in what we call “protection relays.” There are protection relays for all kinds of issues, but two major ones are connected to frequency: Generator Rejection and Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS).</p>
<p>UFLS is a time-function device where the lower your frequency gets, the faster, and more, it sheds the load. It is designed to trigger in steps based on fixed frequency thresholds. </p>
<p>Generation rejection is set up to protect the turbine blades from that vibration and resonance I mentioned before. Overfrequency generation rejection will trigger sooner than underfrequency generation rejection. This is because the only fix for high frequency is to decrease total power. The underfrequency generation rejection doesn’t trigger until the UFLS takes place. If UFLS wasn’t enough to save the grid, underfrequency generation rejection pulls the generators off to protect them from the blackout that’s about to come. </p>
<p>Since there are hundreds of thousands of relays across a grid, there isn’t really a way to bypass this protection to allow you to run the generators despite the frequency even if you didn’t care about the damage. It would take weeks of relay techs visiting every substation to change set points for the triggers. </p>
