		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your body produces the hormones that signal that &quot;full&quot; feeling when you're asleep. If you don't get enough sleep, your body can't regulate your metabolism as well as it would on a sufficient night's rest. </p>
</li>
<li>You didn't sleep enough last night.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's because too little sleep has been linked to higher levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for triggering hunger.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, when you're sleep deprived, you'll usually crave carb-y, calorie-laden foods, as your body searches for alternate sources of energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Food During the Day</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't eat enough during the day, or if you eat at the wrong times, you might not have enough calories to sustain your body while you sleep. For example, if you eat dinner early, you're more likely to wake up hungry before breakfast, according to Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian, writing for NBC Today. Eating dinner later can help you make it all night without a growling stomach. Including fiber in your evening meal or nighttime snacks can also help, Bauer notes. Fiber fills your stomach and digests more slowly, so you feel full longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're actually just thirsty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A little mild dehydration can give you a sluggish, fatigued feeling -- and, just like when you're sleep deprived, the body often turns to calories for fuel. That means, then, that you may experience what you think is hunger, when it's really thirst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
