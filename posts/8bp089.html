On Food and Cooking, McGee (Alton Brown constantly references)
Awesome fact from the book: when you eat artichokes, they knock out your sweet taste receptor so whatever you eat next tastes sweet (great reason to eat with mayonnaise). Experiment with drinking glass of water after eating artichoke. Wow!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The IBM Watson team put together a set of recipes that were composed by the technology known as the Watson Discovery Advisor.  The technology was designed to identify semantic concepts in a corpus of documents, then find patterns across all the documents.  </p>
<p>The system was loaded with corpora from three sources:  1) Recipes from Bon Appetit magazine, 2) Chemical definitions for cooking ingredients, and 3) linking it all together, a database of &quot;hedonic psychophysics&quot;, a listing of how we experience different flavors from different ingredients.</p>
<p>The machine was then asked to develop new recipes based on knowledge from these three sources.</p>
<p>You can see some of the results here: <a href="https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/community" target="_blank">Chef Watson</a>.</p>
<p>And a cookbook was published:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Cooking-Chef-Watson-Innovation/dp/149262571X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523540265&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=chef+watson+cookbook" target="_blank">Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson at Amazon</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the responses here are going into contrasts between tastes, but taste is actually a relatively small component in flavor when compared to smell.</p>
<p>Smell, specifically 'retronasal' olfaction that occurs when something is in your mouth or throat, is what primarily informs our sense of flavor. Raspberries and blackberries both taste sour and sweet, but it would be very hard to tell them apart based solely on the taste, you need the smell for that.</p>
<p>It is also important to separate out the effects that are due to texture. Much of this is up to personal taste, but most people will agree that having contrasting textures is important to the enjoyment of a meal. Your tomato and mozzarella salad may taste amazing, but we would consider a smoothie made from it disgusting mainly due to its texture.</p>
<p>OK, so we know flavor mainly comes from smell and that texture plays a role, but is independent from flavor. So what makes certain things taste good together and others not? This is going to sound disappointing, but we don't really know for sure.</p>
<p>This interactive graphic is one of the best I've found on the topic: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flavor-connection-taste-map-interactive/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flavor-connection-taste-map-interactive/</a></p>
<p>Basically, we know that flavors that share a lot of their aromatic compounds (volatile compounds that easily defuse into the air and can be detected in the nose) tend to taste good together. But, most recipes tend to include a cluster of related ingredients and then some that are outside of that general flavor 'neighborhood', and it's not immediately obvious how or why those contrasting flavors are complimentary instead of gross.</p>
<p>Indian cuisine is particularly interesting in this regard because it tends to pull in flavors from all over the map, but somehow ends up with a mixture that is incredibly appealing rather than incredibly confusing.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It's not 100% clear, but it mostly has to do with foods having similar aromatic compound profiles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
