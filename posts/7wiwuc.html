		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic is a polymer - at the molecular level, it's a shapeless* blob of very long molecules all clumped together. A decent analogy is a tangled skein of yarn. It's very difficult to untangle it, but if you take some scissors and cut through it, you can't put it back together. This is because the long polymer chains have been physically cut. The two sides don't generally spontaneously reconnect if you put them next to each other - it might require some outside input of energy (like melting them together).</p>
<p>*some plastics do have semi-crystalline structures</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some things do just stick back together. If you rip a piece of metal in half in the vacuum of space, you expose raw, unoxidized metal on the inside. If you stuck the pieces back together, they would be &quot;cold welded&quot; back together. This usually doesn't happen on Earth because exposed metal surfaces quickly become oxidized in the oxygen atmosphere. It would be like trying to stick two buckets of water together, yes they're both water but there's an outer layer that simply isn't water.</p>
<p>Also a big part of things &quot;sticking&quot; together is from air pressure (or lack thereof) and friction. If you shuffle the pages of two phone books together like a deck of cards, they become extremely difficult to pull apart because of the friction between the hundreds of pages. Phone books are essentially shredded up, &quot;broken&quot; tree, but you can stick them to each other with friction. Air pressure can stick things together as well, like when you push a suction cup onto a flat surface. The suction cup tries to push itself back away from the surface, lowering the air pressure inside the cup. So the air pressure of Earth's atmosphere outside the cup pushes with more force than the low pressure air inside pushes outward, resulting in a net &quot;towards surface&quot; push, which increases friction on the surface, keeping it from sliding around. A suction cup hanging from a ceiling stays there because air pressure overcomes gravity, while a suction cup on a wall stays there because friction overcomes gravity. If you can force two objects together and remove a sufficient amount of air from between them, or intertwine them as with the phone books, they will stick from friction and/or air pressure.</p>
<p>So when you break a piece of plastic, you leave a deformed, jagged edge. You can't stick them back together because there will always be air between them pushing them apart with the same force of the air trying to push them together. Even cold welding would leave a noticeable border on the metal because the pieces wouldn't line up properly, but the partial surfaces that do touch would be cold welded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly the atomic bonds. At the molecular level the crystal lattices (or just bonds) have a certain amount of “potential energy”. At some point, you break the bonds by a stress overload and thus the bonds cannot be stuck together unless through a process of heat treatment. Annealing is a common way, especially to make the material more ductile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the material. Most materials are held together by Van der Waals bonds, which you might have learned about in high school chemistry (non-ELI5: dipole interactions, London dispersion forces). These forces are basically caused by the distance between the proton and electron in an atom or molecule creating small electric fields which attract each other. All materials have these attractions holding them together, and they're very strong at small distances. Think of a Jolly Rancher-- it's basically just sugar, but it would be very, very difficult to pull apart.</p>
<p>However, these interactions decrease very strongly with distance (non-ELI5: about 1/r^6, compared to gravity or pure electronic interactions which scale about 1/r^2). When you break something and put it back together, you're not going to put it back exactly how it was atom by atom. The mismatch between the surfaces combined with the roughness of the surfaces caused by the break means the two pieces can't come close together again and stick back together. If you could exactly line them up how they were before atom-by-atom, though, they would stick back together as good as new! You can test this with materials like mica, which breaks perfectly smooth, so it's easy to stick it back together.</p>
<p>Some materials have additional forces holding them together. Metals have metallic bonds, a &quot;sea of electrons&quot; where the electrons float between atoms. As another commentor mentions, many plastics are made up of long chains that tangle up with each other to keep the material together (though it depends on how long the chains are and how crystalline the material is). However, Van der Waals forces are universal, so you can always count on them holding a material together.</p>
<p>Here's a good series of lecture on the subject of the forces holding surfaces and molecules together, if you're interested: <a href="https://youtu.be/b5oAJjbWBEA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/b5oAJjbWBEA</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
