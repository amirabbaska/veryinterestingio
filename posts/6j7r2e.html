		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot to unpack in what you asked, but I'll stick to two points.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Neurons, the brain cells that current brain science considers responsible for the vast majority of computation in the brain, (mostly) don't get replaced. Other cells divide, age, and die at relatively fast rates (skin cells very quickly, bone cells less quickly but still to the point that they'll replace themselves over time as you point out), but neurogenesis happens almost exclusively in the early development of an organism, and until recently it was thought that humans completely stopped generating new neurons in adulthood and survived with the same neurons for the rest of their lives. We now think that there are limited cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_neurogenesis" target="_blank">adult neurogenesis</a>, but most of your neurons in adulthood will be the same throughout your lifespan.</p>
</li>
<li>The brain's way of influencing 'who you are' need not rely on the same exact cells in the brain any more than other parts of your body need to have the same cells to appear the same and perform the same functions. This is determined by properties of your neural networks, such as the strength of synaptic connections between areas of the brain. Thus, though this is speculative, it's possible that a brain that did cycle through its cells as other organs do could still support a continuous consciousness.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: A few people here have mentioned that this question is better suited for /r/philosophy or /r/cogsci, and I actually agree. I was clarifying on the misunderstandings implied by the text of this post, while the core question being asked in the title is highly interdisciplinary in nature. The core question, how one often feels that they have a continuous identity despite the dynamic nature of the material brain (especially synaptic weights and perhaps the lesser-known role of non-neural brain matter like astrocytes), is a fascinating one, and one that likely requires insight from many fields to answer well. I'd point people to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>'s <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-ethics/#ConAcc" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-time/#5" target="_blank">excellent</a> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/" target="_blank">articles</a> on related topics of theories of identity. </p>
<p>The TL;DR is that there are wide-ranging theories of what makes people people --psychological continuity, biological continuity (which may in particularly have to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" target="_blank">Ship of Theseus</a> concerns, though it can debatably do so effectively), narrative self-identification--all of which have their own strengths and weaknesses. Neuroscience can answer empirical questions regarding how, say, the nature of neurogenesis affects whether or not we are 'the same people' given important regions like the hippocampus undergoing serious change, but would not itself provide arguments for one philosophical view over another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons don't undergo the same turnover that other cells do.  In childhood, you have the ability to grow more neurons, but adults generally don't.  Most of the neurons you had when you were born are still with you today.</p>
<p>That being said, the connections between neurons (which are far more important in making who you are than the identity of any neuron) do change a lot.  You are not the same person you were 10 or 20 years ago.  You have new memories, and have probably forgotten things you knew 10 years ago.  You may completely disagree with your past self on things and have different interests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If someone answers this question it would be groundbreaking. We have ideas as to where wakefulness and some &quot;traits&quot; of peesonality is located, but there is no &quot;personality center&quot;. Think of the brain as functional units and &quot;networks&quot; rather than isolated cells, but the question is not easier to answer any way.</p>
<p>When people lose substantial parts of their brains (as an effect of for instance an ischemic stroke) they are the same &quot;person&quot; after the event, as in: they identify themselves as the same person that they were before (even through people observing them can notice differens).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I guess the short answer is that there isn't any consistent objective idea of what makes us who we are, or if we stay the same through events like growing up, brain damage or even falling asleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Are you still the same person you were 5 years ago?</p>
<p>Changing one cell is barely noticable its such a small detail but give it years and you will change</p>
<p>Also I think you mean Neurons
Its the neurons that connect to other neurons creating synapses that creates what is &quot;you&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&quot; being just another being living in the illusion of free will, when in reality &quot;you&quot; or the ego as Freud calls it is completely build up by your environment.than its the past ruling the future so you really are both experiencing your life while watching it, its like a book you think youve written but in reality you just colouree in the letters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
