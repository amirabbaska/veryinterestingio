<p>Softer baked goods that already have moisture in them which is used chemically to make their gel-like structure instead lose moisture over time (since there's less moisture in the air than in them).  This makes them harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things going on:</p>
<p>1) Dehydration/re-hydration
2) starch retrogradation</p>
<p>First, let me address dehydration/re-hydration.
Soft baked items such as cake and cookies often contain egg, and are baked until the egg proteins set, but are not baked until all the water content escapes. The baking also activates the chemical leavening, puffing them up. (Cakes and cookies are not typically yeast-leavened; they typically use baking soda or baking powder, which release CO2 as they are heated and/or moistened.) As they &quot;go stale&quot;, they lose water content, leaving the egg protein and starch matrix hard and dry. Hard-baked items like matzos, fillo dough, and other such things are baked to dehydrate them well past the level of ambient moisture. They pick up moisture, and get soft. (Or, to be more precise, lose their crispiness; they don't really ever go totally soft again.)</p>
<p>Secondly, &quot;staleness&quot; also involves starch retrogradation. Starch is not in its lowest energy state when it is cooked; a portion of it will revert to the uncooked state given the passage of time because it is energetically favorable. This reversion to the uncooked or less-cooked state is what constitutes some of the texture of &quot;staleness&quot; in baked goods. Retrograded starch is harder than the soft-cooked stuff, but softer than the hard-cooked stuff. Retrogradation can be reversed to a large extent by just re-heating the baked goods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
