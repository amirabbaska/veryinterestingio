		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bodies need sleep to repair and regenerate. Little sleep means little repair, so your body is breaking apart and it can't put itself back together quickly. This feels shitty.
Also, if you never get enough sleep, your immune system is lowered, so probably will get sick for real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the definition of &quot;feel sick&quot;.   If you mean exhausted, tired and 'depressed' then <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/here-s-why-you-feel-so-crummy-when-you-re-sick" target="_blank">there is a study on rats</a> which demonstrated that proteins called Interferons appeared to be responsible for most of their &quot;feeling sick&quot; behavior.   Interferons are released by cells under attack to alert the immune system to an infection.  They're like a smoke signal to let the city know that an invading army is coming and rally the troops.   The side effect is that the interferons impair brain function.</p>
<p>So brain impairment from lack of sleep and brain impairment from immune system proteins both result in you feeling bad through different causes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you feel sick in those cases, it's probably you eliciting a stress response to force yourself to stay awake. This activates your body's sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight). Part of this response is to shut down your digestive and immune system which can manifest in feelings of sickness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of sleep gives me a nasty headache. When you say sick, what symptoms do you get? A lot of things happen while youâ€™re asleep. Your blood pressure drops, lowering stress on your heart along with vasodilation(which can cause morning wood in guys). Your brain waves switch gears while you sleep as well, reducing stress and creating dreams, again, a resting mechanism. When we deny our bodies what they need, they will eventually fight back with different symptoms until you indulge them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god, I've been googling this so bloody often and was never able to find a satisfactory explanation. I have this too and for me, feeling sick from lack of sleep feels nothing short of a bomb going off within me. Immediately after waking up too early, I always feel flu-like symptoms (even when I don't actually end up having a cold or the flu), get a migraine, feel dizzy and dehydrated, nauseous, stuffy in my nose, overheated, feverish, all at once. Nothing can alleviate that except going back to sleep. The problem for me is, I get this reaction if I sleep for anything less than 10 hours. 8 hours, and I feel like absolute shit. 5 hours, and there will be a big chance that not only I will feel shit like that but on top of that get actually sick (with a virus or so) in the following days because my immune system appears to completely shut down if I get too little sleep, even if it happens just once. I eat healthy, work out and am quite resilient overall, but as soon as I don't get my 10 hours just once, I'm wrecked. I suffer from Chronic Fatigue on top of that and it's really quite debilitating to need at least 10 hours sleep a night and on top of that still suffer general fatigue throughout the day. :/</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
