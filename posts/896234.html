		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fatigue life can be calculated from S-N curves for a particular material with a particular heat treat and surface finish.  A S-N curve is an empirical, statistical curve that compares the magnitude of stress with cycles to failure.  So for primary structure, you're probably looking at 99% probability that 99% of parts have that fatigue life.</p>
<p>The stress to look up on the curve is found from any number of stress analysis methods.  For a wing, you can probably hand calculate the stress from any bending loads due to a sudden increase in lift.  On a modern design, the stress analyst will use finite element models to predict the stress at that location.</p>
<p>Gust loads are empirical.  They represent a sudden increase in lift, depending on airspeed and aircraft type.  You analyze for a gust condition superimposed on 1G steady flight, because no reasonable pilot is pulling big maneuvers in turbulence and it would be overly conservative to stack the gust condition on your worst case maneuver.  This means that gusts rarely size any major structure for static strength, but you're correct that it is important for fatigue analysis.</p>
<p>With those 3 pieces of information, you can make informed decisions on aircraft life.  If the stress is low enough, the S-N curve will tell you the part has infinite life.  That's usually the goal for high cycle vibrations that the aircraft experiences multiple times per second.  On the other end of the spectrum are G-A-G (ground-air-ground) cycles.  That's the maximum stress a part will see during flight and limits the number of takeoffs and landings you can do.  So a GAG cycle is the full range between 0G on the ground to 2G or higher in the air, while those high cycle vibrations are just tiny oscillations between .99G and 1.01G that happen millions of times over the life of the aircraft.  The aircraft spec will have some limit like 10,000 GAG cycles.  In between those two, you have a full spectrum of stresses and cycles that have to be added up to represent the total damage to a part over time, including turbulence.  Some components may be replaced every 1000 hours if that is simple enough to do, or required to have infinite life because they can never be replaced.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that gust loads are empirical, fatigue life is empirical, and expected stresses are analytical.  Those allow you to calculate the life of a part in units of time or number of cycles.  That is communicated to the customer as a general airframe limit, so nobody is tracking that single joint to know when it is done.  They just know the whole airplane is no good after a certain number of flights or flight hours.</p>
<p>Edit:  I also should have mentioned that we fatigue test empty airframes on the ground for new aircraft.  So even if something was missed in the analysis, you would find it in a safe environment before the test aircraft ever hit that many cycles and way before passengers ever take a ride.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These answers here provide a good theoretical answer, but not any answers that are actually practical. </p>
<p>For the US Navy, we actually have strain stress gauges strategically located throughout our fighter jets that analyze how much stress the most vulnerable parts of the aircraft undergo as they perform. If one of the strain-stress gauges gets set off, the bird is grounded until a full analysis is performed and any structural issues are resolved. We call this “over g-ing” the plane, and it’s something that unfortunately happens fairly frequently.</p>
<p>Now with fighter jets, this is a real concern. For the F/A-18E/F you have 11 weapons stations, and depending on the load of the aircraft, the limits of how the pilots fly the jet change regularly. Pulling a 4g loop is possible when the plane is under light load, but when fully loaded you can’t pull anywhere near that kind of maneuver. </p>
<p>For commercial jets, this isn’t really any sort of issue at all. You can google pictures of Boeing stress testing the wings of a 737. Their stress test goes well above and beyond the capabilities of the jet itself. With the engines, ailerons, and stabilators that a 737 has, it’s not possible to push one of those jets to the point where strain-stress actually could tear the plane apart. Sure, outrageous events like tornadoes could cause such excessive stresses (not that a commercial plane would be allowed to take off in such excessive environments), but typical nature can’t, so it’s not really something that has to be worried about very much. Basically, those planes still have the same strain-stress gauges that our planes have, they’re basically prox switches that constantly measure the distance between two points on the aircraft, and when excessive forces are applied, the switches get tripped and alert the aircrew and any maintainers that work on the plane when it gets back on the ground that it needs to be investigated before flying again, as it may not be structurally sound anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered how they calculate it.</p>
<p>As far as keeping track of fatigue, it's something that pilots generally report (Severe turbulence or excessively hard landings etc). If the aircraft experience greater than normal loading for whatever reason, the pilots log it and report it and it's taken into account during major overhauls. </p>
<p>Generally though, aircraft are usually retired after a certain number of cycles or a certain number of years of service, and those numbers are generally both far, far less than what the wing can actually handle. </p>
<p>Major overhauls include metal fatigue examinations (X ray, ultrasound etc). While calculation is nice, it does not always represent reality as things like corrosion, foreign object damage, manufacturing defects (i.e. impurities in the alloy) can drastically change the actual properties of the metal when compared with calculations made based on specifications.</p>
<p>Long story short, fatigue is basically calculated by checking takeoff and landing cycles, with potential damage events necessitating an immediate inspection, and aircraft are removed from service or parts replaced far before their actual service lifetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major aspect missing from the above answers is the damage tolerance philosophy used in aerospace. Essentially, in addition to the S-N approach where empirical data is used to evaluate the overall fatigue life of the aircraft, aerospace engineers also look at how much damage a structure can withstand and how quickly it will grow. </p>
<p>So for a metal wing structure, fatigue damage will appear in the form of fatigue cracks. A damage tolerance analysis would look at how long it would take for such a fatigue crack to grow from a minimum detectable size (depending on inspection method to be used in service) until it’s critical size that would cause loss of structural integrity. This time period represents the window of opportunity to detect and repair damages if they happen to occur, and is used to specify inspection intervals for the aircraft (typically multiple inspections would be prescribed for the length of the inspection interval). </p>
<p>This approach is very useful in helping to mitigate issues with possible manufacturing defects and other anomalies that would reduce the overall fatigue life relative to the empirical S-N data based on pristine material data. It also allows designers to include interesting design features that improve the survivability of the aircraft to certain failures. For instance, many metallic wings have 3 separate wing skin panels so that if a crack forms eventually results in failure of one panel, the other two panels are sized to be able to fly to the nearest airport under “get home” loads (ie: the pilot would know there is a problem if one panel broke and would request an emergency landing and fly the aircraft a lot more gently than if not an emergency). </p>
<p>I hope that is all clear. I am writing on my mobile at the moment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
