		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US can't really stop a country using the dollar without massive amounts of work. The dollar is used all over the world for all sorts of things. To take one example, you have to buy oil in USD. Because it is the main world currency, governments keep some on hand at all times</p>
<p>This suits the US just fine. Because everyone relies on the dollar, other nations will be at pains not. To tank the US economy because it makes them poorer too</p>
<p>The USD isn't shared though. Zimbabwe doesn't have any power over it. Zimbabwe is tiny compared even to one US state, so it doesn't make a difference. Other countries use the dollar too. Like Vietnam and Cambodia. On the ground, dollars are accepted currency. Some countries, like Montenegro, use the Euro</p>
<p>If you want a currency union between equal sized nations, there has to be value flows, or else all the wealth gets sucked into only a few places. This is happening in the Eurozone now, with money moving from South to North. To fix this, you need the North to give money to the south. That requires a close political union</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zimbabwe buys USD, it doesn't print them. You can change the value of a currency by drastically adding or removing the number of them in circulation, and Zimbabwe is so much smaller than the US that it just can't.</p>
<p>There are convenience arguments for a mega currency as you put it, but the problem is when economies collapse. It is up to the better off countries to support whichever nation collapsed and provide that government with more money. This happened with the euro, where Germany's currency drops because of spain/greece/ireland, because it is all the same currency. That is the major risk of sharing a currency.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zimbabwe is using US dollars the way everyone in the US uses dollars, which is just to pass them around in exchange for goods and services. The US doesn't <em>allow</em> Zimbabwe to do it, they're just doing it.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe doesn't significantly impact the value of the dollar for a few reasons, primarily because Zimbabwe can't print new dollars. They can't make promises to give other people more dollars later in exchange for goods or services now, the way a treasury bond works. When the US makes that kind of promise, the person holding the bond knows absolutely 100% that they will get those dollars because the treasury can literally just print them off. Zimbabwe can only promise that they will somehow <em>earn</em> more dollars to give out.</p>
<p>There are several countries that use the US dollar as their currency. Still others tie the value of their currency directly to the dollar, in the same way that the US dollar <em>used to be but presently isn't</em> based on gold. The benefit to this is that you can have a very stable currency, because the US dollar is pretty stable. That's why the US dollar used to be based on gold - the scarcity and demand for gold generally don't change much, so being able to say &quot;I will give you X gold for Y dollars&quot; keeps your currency stable. You know that at any time if you don't want dollars anymore (essentially, the dollar has lost value <em>to you</em> and you want something of greater value) you can at any time trade your dollars for gold. That makes you confident in accepting dollars as payment because you can get rid of them later and get something valuable back. Change &quot;gold&quot; for dollars and &quot;dollars&quot; for whatever local currency they're using and you get a similar effect...*</p>
<p>(We don't really base the value of the dollar on gold anymore. Rather, you're confident that other people will still accept the dollar for whatever good or service you want, so you know you can still get something with that dollar, because you're confident that the United States will continue existing in a way that maintains the buying power of that dollar.)</p>
<p>*...Assuming the dollar stays stable - a reasonable bet for most of recent history, but it's still a bet. The reason most countries use their own currency is so they can have control over it. By controlling how dollars enter circulation through bank lending rates and the issuing of bonds, we can have a measure of control over the value of a dollar. Zimbabwe sacrificed that control. If we do something wonky to the dollar, their economy suffers as a result. <em>They</em> aren't big enough as a world economy to affect the US very much. The US economy is the largest in the world, so what we do very much affects Zimbabwe even if they <em>weren't</em> using our currency.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the US spontaneously ceases to exist as a country and the dollar becomes worthless, every country that relies on the dollar as their currency or the backing of their currency is going to have <em>a very bad day</em>.</p>
<p>All of those problems are associated with sharing a currency with another country. It's a problem the Eurozone has faced again and again - one country (usually Greece, sometimes Italy, sometimes someone else) has a failing economy and makes promises on the Euro that it can't repay. In order to keep the Euro from crashing as a result, other countries have to bail them out (usually Germany). If you can't make promises on the currency, then you have no control over it, which is not what countries generally want. If you <em>can</em>, then you <em>do</em>, which is not what <em>other</em> countries using the same currency generally want. Even if you do absolutely nothing wrong or irresponsible with the currency, if your economy crashes everyone else is tied to you and your crash will have a much stronger impact on them.</p>
<p>Which is why we will almost certainly never have an Eartho outside the realm of science fiction and space travel. To most countries, the benefits of having a single currency aren't worth the problems associated with giving up control over that currency. Hell, look at the US right now: <strong>without discussion about whether it's right or wrong or good or bad</strong> our administration is obsessed with trade deficits with our historically closest trading partners and the control they have over the US economy just through organically emerging trade between private companies, much less if Canada and Mexico were issuing bonds in US dollars!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
