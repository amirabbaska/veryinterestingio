		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A certain sleep writer suggests it's because there is a metabolitic release timed to coincide with the early part of sleep intended to for the heavy lifting your lymphatic and endocrine systems will do in the early part of sleep. Apparently this is the &quot;second wind&quot; we feel at approximately 10pm, and being asleep at this point results in higher quality sleep.</p>
<p>This is the only thing I've come up with on the topic so far. It seams reasonable that one's body would benefit from a release of energy for homonal/repair/immune function that does happen during sleep; however, I traced the reference chain back finally back to an Ayurvedic medicine writer, and haven't found any peer-reviewed empirical research on the topic (yet), so I think the jury is still out on this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once your circadian rhythm has been disrupted for about 8-10 minutes, your body begins to slowly release endorphins as an emergency response to remain awake. This is mainly due to the same mechanism that governs &quot;fight or flight&quot; and is intended to provide awareness against predators or other threats. The endorphins are released slowly compared to a situation where you are immediately in danger, and the supply lasts longer. As you remain awake, the sensation of awareness is heightened at the expense of a larger crash later, when the supply runs out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
