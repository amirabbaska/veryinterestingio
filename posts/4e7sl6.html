<p>When I'm drumming on the tabletop with my fingers, I'm John Bonham, but all my wife hears is an annoying fucking noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those type of actions are about soothing or entertaining yourself. You get positive feedback from the noise or motion. Other people just get an annoying click, tap, or track suit rustling as you bounce your leg up and down in 3rd period noise. Great for you as it works out your nerves, not for others because it's just a noise or motion.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small stimuli can be soothing when you yourself are creating them because it's a tiny call and response game for your mind. You tap each finger, and your brain expects a sound and feeling for each one, so it's calming when that happens. You know when the tap is coming so it doesn't bother you. </p>
<p>But to others in the room it's an outside stimulus, which means that their brain is designed to &quot;figure it out,&quot; so to speak. Their brain is looking for patterns in the tapping, trying to figure out if it's getting closer or further away, analyzing every time the taps are at different intervals. Their conscious brain knows that it's just stupid bullshit, but their subconscious brain is still paying attention, which makes it annoying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD person here. When I am working on a task that requires mental concentration I enjoy having part so of my mind occupied by other activities such as drumming a finger, tapping with my feet, listening to music on repeat and similar. My own theory is that it occupies enough of my mind not to be distracted but not more to take my concentration away. Problem is that it takes concentration and focus away from others...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Similar circumstance, but it might apply-- I remember hearing once that the reason you get annoyed when you are in a public place and someone is on their cellphone, but not by overhearing a conversation is because our brain struggles and is annoyed to have only half the information. I wonder if the similar idea is true-- the tapper knows the melody and lyrics, etc. of the song they are tapping where as others cannot process only a part of the stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
