		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newborns receive all their nutrition from breast milk or formula. They also have very small stomachs, and if you fill the stomach with water, they won't be hungry for milk or formula and thus might not receive adequate nutrition. As they grow, their stomachs become larger and their digestive system better equipped to handle mushy foods and water in addition to breast milk or formula.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies are expected to double or triple their weight in the first 6 months. It takes a lot of calories and nutrients to do that healthily. As mentioned by other posters, water fills the baby up and makes them full, but without any nutrition.</p>
<p>That's only around 180 days. That's a relatively small number of meals. So each meal that gets replaced by water represents a fairly significant percentage of the food this child has ingested over its entire life till that point.</p>
<p>It's all about making sure that the baby's body has everything it needs and isn't running out of gas, so to speak. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is they need a dense highly nutritious intake, almost constantly, during their first months of life to help them grow.  If they had water, it would fill them up but provide no nutritional value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the interference with babies nutritional information already provided above.</p>
<p>&quot;In rare cases, a baby who drinks too much water can develop a condition known as water intoxication, which can cause seizures and even a coma. Water intoxication happens when too much water dilutes the concentration of sodium in the body, upsetting the electrolyte balance and causing tissues to swell.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it causes hyponatremia and seizures, and can kill your baby.  My first peds patient in med school was a baby where the dad had given 2-3 oz of water a few times that morning.  Babies have stupid kidneys that aren't good at concentrating urine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
