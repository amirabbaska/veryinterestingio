		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a metal. It's an electrical conductor so many of its electrons are free to move around when the system is at room temperature. The electrons in the metal behave like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_gas" target="_blank">Fermi gas</a>.</p>
<p>As you cool the system down to absolute zero, it must approach its quantum-mechanical ground state. In this state, all electrons occupy the lowest available state. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents any two electrons from being in the same state, so the electrons in the Fermi gas at absolute zero pile up into higher and higher momentum states. The highest occupied states will be around the Fermi level, and electrons in those states will have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_energy" target="_blank">Fermi energy</a> and Fermi momentum.</p>
<p>Using the energy of an electron at the Fermi level, you can convert it into a speed, and you'll find that in a metal at absolute zero, you still have electrons moving at upwards of <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/fermi.html" target="_blank">10^(6) m/s</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So for anything you'll encounter in daily life, at ordinary temperatures, you've as good an idea of where all the electrons are as you'll ever have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is measure of the activity in material. In a gas for example, temperature is determined by the average velocity of the individual atoms/molecules: higher average speed, higher temperature. This means that you can only have a meaningful measure of temperature if there are enough particles to take an average over. A single atom therefor does not have a temperature, electrons always behave the same.</p>
<p>I have to add that when you take a material, it does have a temperature and this temperature has an influence on the excitation of the electrons. This is however due to external factors such as lattice vibrations and photons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
