		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: there is no conclusive evidence that dogs have dominant paws.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635702001614" target="_blank">Wells (2003)</a> seems to suggest that many dogs do, and furthermore the effect is highly sex dependent. At a group level (so not every dog), females tended to prefer their right paws and males their left. However, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635706001537" target="_blank">Poyser, Caldwell, and Cobb (2006)</a> failed to replicate this pattern of results using a somewhat different paradigm in which each dog needed to repeat a task several times. They argue that other results that did show an effect may be due to sex-dependent differences in brain hemispheres that cause paw preference in responding to novel stimuli but not when engaged in repetitive tasks. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1357650X.2012.723008" target="_blank">This review article</a> deals with debates regarding handedness in many non-human species, with a general pattern that many vertebrate species show population-level handedness effects that are much less consistent across tasks and individuals than in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about dogs, but horses definitely favour one front hoof over the other! </p>
<p>This is usually seen where during a canter (3rd gear, if you will) where they will choose to lead with their left or right hoof. It usually depends on the direction the horse is moving, because they tend to use their inside leg. Ie  if they’re  cantering curving left, they’ll use the left front leg to lead, and if they’re cantering to the right they’ll use their right front leg to lead.
Advanced riders can force a horse to change its dominant leg mid stride which is very impressive to watch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about all dogs, but our pupper always uses her left paw by default to prevent things she doesn't want, like putting on collars, or avoiding being pet because she doesn't feel like it. BUT, for things she wants, like asking you to pet her, or scratches at you for attention, she uses her right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
