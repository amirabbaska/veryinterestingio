		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There do appear to be at least some species which wouldn't see common glass as transparent. For example, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Soda-lime_glass%2C_typical_transmission_spectrum_%282_mm_thickness%29.svg/1000px-Soda-lime_glass%2C_typical_transmission_spectrum_%282_mm_thickness%29.svg.png" target="_blank">here is what the transmission spectrum of a typical piece of pane glass looks like</a>. Depending on the exact composition, the transmission will quickly start to fall off somewhere between 300-400nm. While we can't tell the difference, some animals such as certain butterflies are sensitive to this wavelength range (<a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/663192" target="_blank">source</a>). As a result, they would perceive the glass as &quot;colored&quot; in the sense that they would see a change in intensity in light passing through the glass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>utter transparency like in a crystal is largely a property of the molecules aligning, and less to do with electromagnetic wavelength frequencies a.k.a. color.   But if you had a specific colored pair of sun-glasses that only allowed say red light through, yes indeed animals who cannot see red would not be able to look through these lenses. They would look blackish.   You can, however, easily imagine the reverse scenario to your question.  If a creature had eyes that pick up radio wave frequencies, they would literally see through all matter that our radio waves pass through.  Everything would just be clear to them for a good distance. Looking down into the earth would go however deep radio signals go until earth would block it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We also don't really know the full extent of all the eyes out there in the world and are learning things regularly. The Mantis Shrimp was made famous by The Oatmeal for being able to see unfathomable variety due to an exceptionally high number of photoreceptors.</p>
<p>Humans have red/green/blue sensitivity giving us good coverage between UV and IR frequencies. Dogs have two and are thus 'colorblind' by comparison.</p>
<p>The Mantis Shrimp eye has 12 and so theoretically they have ultra wide band vision that is super sensitive. In reality, that may not be the case, with experiments showing less ability to distinguish between similar colors than you'd expect. A lot of their vision is sensitive to very particular UV bands though:</p>
<p>&quot;The rock mantis shrimp, for example, has six photoreceptors dedicated to this part of the spectrum, each one tuned to a different wavelength. Thatâ€™s the most complex UV-detecting system found in nature. &quot;</p>
