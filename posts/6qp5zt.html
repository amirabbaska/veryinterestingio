		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the difference is &quot;Octane&quot;, which in simple terms is an additive that makes gas LESS flammable.</p>
<p>You might think that sounds like a bad thing, why would you pay more money for less flammable gas?</p>
<p>Well, the trick to a car engine is getting the gas to burn <em>precisely</em> when you want it to.  Which is generally right after the piston hits the top of its rotation.  It does this with a spark plug.</p>
<p>The problem is, engines are hot and violent, and when a bunch of air and gas are highly compressed in such an environment, it may detonate before the engine intended.</p>
<p>In which case that means that the explosion is actually pushing against a piston still trying to travel up.  Not good for an engine...  its often heard as a &quot;knocking&quot; sound (and thus is known as as engine knocking).  Also bad for efficiency and power.</p>
<p>So you can design the engine to have less compression in the cylinder, make the fuel mixture less likely to self ignite, but that produces less power.  So higher end engines instead call for higher octane fuel so they can be sure the gas will not ignite until they say so.</p>
<p>Many modern engines will adjust themselves to tolerate any grade of fuel, producing a bit more power with the &quot;better&quot; fuel.</p>
<p>There is some efficiency to be gained here as well, but it will basically never offset the price premium of the more expensive gas.  If your concerned about cost over power and your car will accept either (check your owners manual) you will be better with regular fuel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The types of gasoline are usually associated with an octane rating.  The higher the octane rating, the harder the fuel is to ignite via compression.</p>
<p>The efficiency of each will depend on the motor.  My car is tuned for 93 octane, and using anything lower risks damaging my engine.  When my car was stock, using any octane would have been acceptable, but peak HP and gas mileage was still on 93/91 as this is what the engine was designed for.</p>
<p>If your car is specced for the lowest octane, that is what you should use as using higher octane would not benefit (or hurt you) at all (other than cost).</p>
<p>tldr:  use what gas your car is supposed to use.  Generally, this can be found near your gas cap</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, your elevation changes the compression ratio of your engine.
Dynamic v/ Static.</p>
<p>In other words you can run less octane at high elevation because your engine has less dynamic compression because there is actually less oxygen available to burn.</p>
<p>If your engine is not running higher than about 12:1 compression (dynamic) then you can usually run the cheap stuff all you want.</p>
<p>And to highlight what is said below, not only is it cheaper, its better for your engine, and is more efficient.</p>
<p>TLDR If you live in the mountains you can run less octane, and running high octane in a regular old fashioned car is a waste of money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the piston compresses the mixture of air and fuel to burn, it stands a chance to ignite without spark just from the energy created by squeezing it. The three different types of gas are there because different engines are shaped differently and so are more or less liable to detonate early, so an additive is put into the fuel to help resist it. The higher the number, the higher resistance too early ignition.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean you need the higher number. Plenty of cars run just fine on 87 octane. It's wholly dependent on your car. Your average engine in a Toyota Camry only needs 87 Octane, but turbocharged motors or ones with a high compression ratio (how much volume is squeezed down) need higher octane.</p>
<p>No fuel is more efficient than the other based on octane rating. Individual gas companies have their own blends which may contain detergents that prevents buildup from creating inefficiencies, but it's nothing that couldn't be achieved with an $8 bottle of fuel system cleaner once a year.</p>
<p>Read your owner's manual to find out which gas works best for your car. You don't need anything more than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on, you don't need higher octane if your car doesn't require it. It doesn't &quot;clean out your system&quot; or any of that other BS that gets thrown around. Unless you're running a high-performance, high-compression engine (think turbocharged in some way) and it states higher octane requirement in the owner's manual, you're just throwing money away.</p>
<p>It used to be that as long as you car doesn't &quot;knock&quot;, you don't need higher octane fuel. Nowadays though, with heavily computerized engines, if you do use lower octane fuel in a higher-performance engine then recommended (again see owner's manual), it may automatically &quot;adjust&quot;, which does mean it won't knock but you are losing performance/efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
