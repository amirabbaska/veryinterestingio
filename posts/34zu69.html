<p>Like a moth will fly around a light or candle, because it think it's using the moonlight for navigation. Flies just circle around, not realizing their circling around, they're just flying around, avoiding walls and other obstacles looking for food.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello im an entomologist. I want to address a couple things. 1. Insect eyes are not shitty, they are evolved to address the concerns of each spp. For example, Odonates (dragonflies etc) eyes plug so directly into their head-brain they can react really fast to movement eg predator or prey.  2. We do not know why many nocturnal insects are positively phototaxic, but the hypothesis is moon related.  3.  Insects never do anything aimlessly unless they are dying.  They are assessing their environment, in a number of really surprising ways considering their complexity.  Catch them and put them in your freezer and make a nice display out of them.  Thats what I would do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just studied behavioral entomology in one of my courses, and essentially it came down to detecting chemicals or pheromones in their environments. Also, insects are programmed to be random in their movements. It is thought that this would be the best way to scavange for food and other insects as the way they move actually covers more ground over a period of time. I wish I had this program for you that we looked at, as it was completely focused on insect movement and behavior and simulated these movements in response to inputs (like placement of bad/good pheromones). Pretty interesting! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many responses claim insects are stupid, robotic, or have poor senses. These responses display some of the poorer attributes of humans: the inability to understand predation and understand scale, and most important the inability of humans to understand diversity.</p>
<p>Some insects have excellent vision and despite small brains are capable of complex interactions with each other and their environment. Many insects can see polarized light IN THREE ALIGNMENTS just as we see colored light in three frequencies. Many have chemosensors and mechanosensors that are highly adapted; they are not blind to the world. </p>
<p>Besides looking for mates and food (note that many individual insects, just like redditors, never get to mate, and unlike redditors in many species the adults don't even have mouths and do not eat) there are two huge factors they need to overcome: predators, and being tiny.</p>
<p>Predators: Unlike humans, most other species on the planet build their lives around not being eaten. They hide in numbers, they hide by being mobile, and they hide from other mobile and numerous insects by having intense energetic activity.</p>
<p>Tininess: the &quot;lek&quot; is the mating swarm, which includes dozens or thousands of male insects, attracted to a site by some environmental cue like polarized light bouncing  off the water's surface in the evening, or the top of a hill, or a large shadow like a tree or a human. In this way the males find each each other and attract females sometimes through patterned flight or syncopated wing beats making a certain noise.</p>
<p>The diversity of insects is staggering, and this means that for every rule there are exceptions.They are highly adapted to their environments, and invest only as much into controlling flight as they need. What appears to be aimless is the result of not only bizarre senses and complex behavior in an alien environment, but is also the result of millions of generations of evolutionary adaptation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circling around might not be a stupid idea when they are looking for food. Chemical signals from food and mates get dispersed quite a lot by turbulence in the air - it might catch a whiff at one place and then suddenly there is nothing just a few inches away. In order to precisely locate the source of this chemical signal, they need to circle around here and there looking for cues. It's not like once they catch a whiff they can just follow the trail of scent; there is no trail because of turbulent dispersion. Moths are known to locate mates a few hundreds of meters away, which is pretty amazing actually.
