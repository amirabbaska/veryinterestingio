		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to my physiotherapist.</p>
<p>As muscles and tendons heal, scar tissue form. The scar tissues are not as flexible and good as the original, that's why old injured spots can feel stiff and painful sometimes.</p>
<p>Flexes and exercises strengthen and stretch muscles, which help break apart the scar tissues, also move blood there which promote healing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to put my two cents out there and disagree with /u/StarchCraft. I am not a physiotherapist and they would have more practical experience than I would, but purely on textbook pathophysiology it makes zero sense to me for you to intentionally work an injured area. It seems to me that the 'recovery' you would cause is actually an illusion. It is scar tissue filling in where muscle used to be, so the muscle is no longer able to generate the same force through the full range of motion. I'd bet $10 that you can't lift a weight quite as high as before, regardless of effort. The muscle is effectively permanently stretched.</p>
<p>IMO the best thing to do if you suspect muscle or tendon injury is to follow exactly what common wisdom and instinct suggests. Rest. Your body has inherited 100,000+ years more experience than you have in how best to deal with injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
