		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly it's due to regulations.</p>
<p>Europe has much stricter regulations about what sort of fuel can be sold than Australia does, as well as much stricter regulations about the quality of the fuel (I believe EU has a limit on Sulphur content in <del>Diesel</del> petrol fuel of a max. 10ppm, whereas Australia has a limit of 150ppm for 91 RON and 50ppm for 95 and 98 RON).</p>
<p>This means that Australia has a cheaper fuel option (91 RON, as you've mentioned) but also means that Australia tends to get cars optioned with lower tech engines (the Honda Jazz in Australia, for instance, gets an older SOHC engine that runs on 91 RON, compared to the higher tech, more powerful DOHC engines for Japan and Europe) or where the engine is the same, it'll get tuned so it makes lower power to be able to run on the lower quality of fuel.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>why</em> the Australian government has done this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lobbying from the former manufacturing industry, who were able to make cars for the local market that were suited to the lower quality fuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regional characteristics - the countries around australia all have similar fuel quality, so maintaining the same level means common tunes for vehicles, and lower costs through not having to re-tune for the local market</p>
</li>
<li>Lobbying from fuel providers, who are resistant to change</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like this will be changing soon though, as the car manufacturing industry is dead in Australia, and most car companies now want Australia to more in line with the more dominant European market, especially as the new <a href="http://wltpfacts.eu/" target="_blank">fuel and emissions standards</a> are coming into effect, which will make it even harder to run on 91 RON fuel and still pass Euro emissions. As a result, there's likely to be a phase out of 91 RON fuel in Australia in the next few years (assuming it's agreed upon by parliament, and gets through all the red tape) otherwise Australia could see itself become even more of a dumping ground for older, inferior engines as the next generation aren't able to run on 91 RON fuel.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cars in Germany used to run on RON 91 as well in the old days. Then came stricter emission norms, which were largely implemented using higher compression. Now RON is a measure how likely a fuel mixture is to ignite without a spark. Higher compression makes this more likely. Hence, you need higher RON (less likely to spontaneously ignite) fuel. </p>
<p>Now just looking around Australia it looks to me like the emission standards arenâ€™t even remotely as strict as they are in Europe. Hence I guess you can still get back with RON 91 consuming engines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 for people who dont know cars/fuels </p>
<p>Question: Why are cars in Australia able to run on lower quality fuel compared to cars in Europe? </p>
<p>Answer: Europe has strict rules on car emissions. To achieve this cars need high tech engines, which needs higher quality fuels to run. Aussie rules arent so strict regarding emissions so they can still use low quality fuel for low tech engine cars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
