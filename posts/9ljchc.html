<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQkjT9tJg4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQkjT9tJg4</a></p>
<p>Basically as air flows over a curved surface (like an airfoil), the boundary layer slows due to friction and may not have the energy to go around the curve, which causes the air to separate from the airfoil creating drag or even causing stall.</p>
<p>Vortex generators keep the boundary layer attached to the surface at higher angles, meaning you can get lift out of areas that otherwise would have drag or stall, improving performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are to help the air 'stick' to the surface as it bends over the blade.</p>
<p>There are two types of airflow around a surface - a laminar flow, where the air flows smoothly, with the inner layer stuck to the surface, and the speed of the airflow increasing steadily until it is at a full speed some small distance from the surface. The other is a turbulent flow, where, between the air stuck to the surface and the air moving at full speed there is a thin layer of turbulent (spinning, disturbed) air.</p>
<p>Laminar flow is fragile - if you try to make it stick to and curve around a surface, it breaks free, leaving a large void of low-pressure air. We call this 'stalling', and when this happens, the wind no longer works at turning the blade (or lifting the aircraft, when it is a wing). So they add those little lumps, that trips up the airflow and ensures that it forms a turbulent 'boundary layer', which sticks to the surface, pulling the air around the blade and creating lift to turn the turbine.</p>
<p>I realised another reason why those protrusions might be there - at the root of the blade, it is pretty much circular, and as wind flows around a cylinder, it causes 'vortex shedding' that creates uncontrollable forces. It causes vibration in cables and chimneys, and that is why they put spiral bands around the outside of cylindrical pipes. These protrusions on the roots of the blades could also control this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other explanations are accurate. They are vortex generators added to blades to change laminar flow to turbulent flow farther upstream on the blade.</p>
<p>Obvious but also worth noting that the reason you want more lift on the blade to produce more energy. A somewhat common misconception is that the wind is “pushing” the rotor around, whereas the blades are actually “pulled” to spin via lift. Obviously to anyone who works with similar structures, but maybe not common knowledge. </p>

</ol>
<p>The root of the blade is seen in the photo; it functions only as support / connection to the hub. There would be zero power generated here and therefore vortex generators would no help nor make sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
