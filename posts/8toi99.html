		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Oh no. Oh God no. You're so dead. It's not even really the UV rays that do the damage.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> The important thing to know up front about 'radiation' is that it's a bit of a catch all term, and many of the uses have almost nothing to do with each other. To 'radiate' just means to give off energy. Sometimes that energy is good- the sun is radiating electromagnetic radiation, like visible light and infrared and UV. Other times, nuclear fallout is radioactive and emits electrons and alpha particles, which are incredibly dangerous inside your body. So that's takeaway number one- there are different kinds of 'radiation' and it's a bit of an overused buzzword at this point. </p>
<p>Now let's go back to your question. I'm going to give you two answers, one about atomic bombs and one about a reactor meltdown. Bombs first though, because that's more fun.</p>
<p>Nuclear explosions tend to kill in 3 ways, depending on your distance from ground zero. The first is the fireball itself. That's the central explosion part. If you're near that, you're incinerated. Full stop. Nothing except a bunker under meters and meters of concrete will save you.</p>
<p>Going farther out, the next things to kill are the overpressure and thermal radiation. Out here, the shockwave from the nuclear blast can rupture organs, but more likely it'll make a building fall on you. And similar to the fireball, the thermal radiation zone is <em>hot.</em> Like, imagine the sunrise on the horizon got bigger until it occupied 100x more of the sky than it used to, getting hotter and hotter until everything is on fire. That's what a nuclear bomb is like. Here, it's photons of all wavelengths that are impinging on you, burning you to a crisp. Sunscreen just filters some of the UV rays from the sun- it'll do nothing to stop you from cooking in this. </p>
<p>Last, of course, is the nuclear radiation that you asked about. In fact, this part of the answer is the same for the bomb and for the meltdown, which is why I saved it for here. Nuclear fission, whether in a bomb or reactor, makes a lot of radioactive nuclei which will decay and emit electrons (beta) and high energy helium nuclei (alpha), which produce a lot of damage in biological tissues. Other sources of the 'radioactive' kind of radiation include spontaneous fission and neutron emission from other radioactive nuclei. After bombs and meltdowns this stuff spreads, and if you're inhaling this stuff in any considerably amount you're pretty much gonna die a horrible painful death. Sunscreen is a glorified Maginot line. </p>
<p>And on a funny historical note, Edward Teller (physicist from the Manhattan project) actually brought sunscreen to his viewing of the first nuclear detonation, the Trinity test. Even in retrospect, that's pretty amusing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something people haven't mentioned yet is that if you were outside, when you go inside, you'll want to ditch your clothes ASAP and take a shower immediately. Thus is to wash off any of the radioactive dust that may have accumulated on your skin and clothes. Wash or dispose of the aforementioned clothes. Do not use conditioner when you shower, it can cause your hair to lock in the radioactive dust. This will prove more useful than sunscreen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’ll be about as useful as bringing an umbrella to a fire fight.</p>
<p>There are five hazards outside of the fireball of death. Radiation; Alpha (free helium), Beta (free electrons), and Gamma (high energy photons), and Neutrons (high kinetic energy). Those four will burn you similar to a sun burn.</p>
<p>The fifth and least discussed, and absolutely most dangerous, are the radioactive daughter products. The high mass fuel splits in halves, and those halves are the daughters. That can be samarium, Xenon, lead, thorium, iodine, cobalt, whatever. It comes off as a light dust (fall out). It continues to be radioactive and releasing the 4 types of radiation above. It’s that crap you can breath in, or it gets on your clothes, or on top of the soil, etc. </p>
<p>Sunblock will help with photons at the UV energy level, but that’s it. Everything else will burn you, or get inside you and burn you. And the daughter products will continuously burn...</p>
<p>Sunblock will only help to make you sticky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your best bet is a Potassium Iodine pill and then lay low for about two weeks until most of the radioactive isotopes have decayed to survivable levels. The KI pill will prevent bioaccumulation of radioactive iodine which will cause massive damage to your tissue from within. If possible create a positive pressure bubble around you using a fan, filter, plastic tarp, and duct tape to force clean air out and away rather than allowing dirty air to flow to you. Assuming you survived the initial blast of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UV radiation has almost zero penetration, which is why when you're in the sun too long it's just your outermost layer of skin that suffers DNA damage(and then dies) and not your whole body.</p>
<p>Sunscreen acts as a thin layer that shields you from the UV radiation, and reduces the amount of radiation that your skin absorbs.</p>
<p>Ionizing gamma radiation, which is one of the types released in the event of a fission reaction, will go right through most things, depending on their energy: Protecting against gamma radiation powerful enough to be an immediate threat requires several centimeters of lead.</p>
<p>And that's the least of your concerns: The real danger here is the nuclear fallout: Radioactive isotopes are released into the environment, dust in the air, in the water, in the soil, and are then absorbed by your body, effectively giving you a constant radiation burn from the inside out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
