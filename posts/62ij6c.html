		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The palmaris longus.  It is a muscle in our forearm.  It doesn't do anything.  14 percent of people don't even have it.  Those that do have one have it because it is a vestige of days when claws and climbing were important for survival (and not a hindrance to handling tools).  It is still there in most people because having the muscle doesn't hurt anything in terms of survival, so there is not pressure on the trait.  In other mammals, it serves to retract skin to expose the claws.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I nominate Palmaris longus. Palmaris longus is a muscle found in the forearm of the human body, originating near the elbow and inserting on the palmar aponeurosis. This muscle serves no apparent purpose, as it has no effect on the tightening or clenching of the hand. In fact, 14% of the population does not even have this muscle! Surgeons seize this opportunity and often remove the palmaris longus to use the tissue to repair muscles elsewhere in the body. There's an easy test you can perform to see if you have this muscle:</p>
<p>Extend your hand out with your palm facing up. Clench your hand into a fist and observe your wrist. If there are two ridges near your wrist, then you have a palmaris longus. Be sure to check both hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
