But as you point out, their days are only roughly 24 hours, it's your choice of unit and rounding that creates the illusion if a pattern.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to point out that adding 40 min to every day is a bigger deal (for humans) than it might seem. </p>
<p>NASA employees who were on &quot;Mars time&quot; to work with the rovers had a multitude of issues. Basically like worsening jet lag. </p>
<p>Perhaps living on Mars and syncing up the day/night cycle might help, but it appears that our brains are wired for 24hour days. </p>
<p>I do know that submariners who work 6hrs on and 12 hours off in an 18hr &quot;day&quot; don't suffer similar effects, even when they lose track of the days and go months w/o seeing the sun. Apparently, just like jet lag, it's easier on the body to subtract hours than add them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I don't know, but I have a theory that someone with a stronger grasp of the physics could possibly explore: could it have something to do with the average rotational velocity of matter around the sun in their orbits?</p>
<p>Both planets are similar distances away from the sun and made of similar materials.  If the average rotational velocity of all the things in each our orbits was about the same, it stands to reason it would be conserved when they all fell together into planets.</p>
<p>Is there some way to check this by measuring a bunch of asteroid belt objects perhaps? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
