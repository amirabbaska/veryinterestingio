		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's part of the &quot;boorish brute&quot; stereotype that's roughly as old as social classes are. Laborers who have to expend lots of energy throughout the day will end up panting heavily and loudly over the course of their work. More &quot;refined&quot; individuals accustomed to leisure are more likely to be able to placidly go about their time breathing through their noses. Lateral stereotypes stemming from this phenomenon includes colorism in Southeast Asia and grooming conventions around fingernails and hand calluses in the West and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Over time, rules of etiquette codified not breathing through your mouth, and the brutish stereotype of mouth breathing was further entrenched into what we see today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a common stereotype, but the only serious connections I can locate are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2lrqbr/why_are_mouth_breathers_considered_less/" target="_blank">here</a> where users point out (1) it means you're uncultured and (2) it could be correlated with the physical symptoms of Down's Syndrome.</p>
<p>I also found some articles that suggest mouth breathing is correlated with sleep apnea, and people with sleep apnea are often tired and spaced out -- seems like a tenuous connection though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that &quot;mouth breather&quot; might be a more figurative term for someone who is &quot;slack jawed,&quot; meaning inattentive or constantly bewildered (Webster's refers to &quot;slack jawed yokels&quot;), rather than a literal commentary on someone's breathing habits.</p>
<p>I found a couple of sites expressing the same opinion, but nothing &quot;official&quot; yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mouth breathing has nothing to due with intelligence. Mouth breathing is more likely due to clogged sinuses. When the flow of air is restricted your instinct is to breathe through your mouth.  Someone might make the conclusion that this restriction of air causes a mental disability, however, mouth breathing takes in  more air than nose breathing because the mouth and throat are wider than the nose passage. Also heavy exertion also results in mouth breathing due to the need for an increase in the amount of air required. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A lot of them seem based around cultural reasons or through extrapolating connections between things as if it was a super conscious premeditated response, which i do not think is what you feel. </p>
<p>I would imagine that it has to do more with how much the mouth contributes to facial expressions and by having it open it makes the face look more blank and thoughtless, devoid of any expressions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
