		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are imprinted from birth (and from shared genetic behavior) that cleaning is caring. Mother or Father both increase levels of attention and care when cleaning their young. This reenforces the social connect and yields a positive interaction. That behavior is then carried forward to older independent self-care rituals like bath and shower. It's further reinforced by the isolating ones self from sources of stress and personal rituals marking that time as a moment of self-care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a specific case, and not applicable to all showers or baths, but cold ones. Taking a cold, or at least cooler than body temperature, shower or bath makes your body have to work harder to keep internal temperatures high. Breathing gets heavier to supply more oxygen, heart rate increases, and by default you feel more alert and awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to evolution.  </p>
<p>It's not hard to understand that being eternally filth-ridden will harm your chances at living a healthy and full life. Naturally species that clean themselves, or more specifically genes that made their host animal clean themselves (a gene that makes you feel good when you are clean), were going to be more successful in living, breeding and thus making it through the process of natural selection.  </p>
<p>It became a very successful, practically unanimous primal behaviour in animals because cleanliness is such a factor for survival that any gene promoting cleanliness will have a major impact on that animal's survival.   </p>
<p>So here we are, with a primal comfort and reward from cleaning, because it drives animals to keep themselves healthy even if they don't realise it. Further years of evolution bound the act of grooming into a social interaction, but at its core it comes down to the fact that a clean animal is less likely to die, so we evolved to deeply appreciate and yearn for cleanliness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
