I, however, am an INCREDIBLY light sleeper. I need earplugs and a sleep mask and even then, you can look at me and I'll wake up. But I notice these patterns are also similar to our personalities. Little things tend not to bother him too much, but minor things are big inconveniences to me. Is there any correlation or am I looking to deep into this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All humans sleep both deeply and lightly; it's a part of the sleep cycle. If you seem to be in lighter sleep more often or all of the time, it's possible you have a medical condition of some kind (i.e. sleep apnea). Similarly, there are conditions that could lead to unusually deep sleep, but they are extraordinarily rare in comparison to the lighter ones. A physician or sleep doctor could tell you more. </p>
<p>This is apparently one of those things that can feel amazing to get treated (in terms of quality of life), so I'd recommend checking it out if you suspect it's happening. I don't have any diagnosed conditions myself, but one runs in my family. </p>
<p>Personally, I wake up if someone so much as breathes in my direction during my light sleep, but in the deeper sleep parts of my cycle you can apparently throw any object or insult at me without any effect. I actually thought I was a &quot;light sleeper&quot; as a child, but it turned out that I was just unaware of the times I was in deep sleep for obvious reasons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never been a deep sleeper and have always had issues with sleeping, ranging from not being able to fall asleep and waking up multiple times during the night to sleep walking and sleep paralysis. I had a sleep study done and nothing showed up. I later learned that I have Dysautonomia,autonomic nervous dysfunction. My specific kind is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), which causes my resting heart rate to be too low, my heart rate go to high when I stand up too quickly or climb a lot of steps, and pass out when my heart rate drops from my blood not going to my brain/heart quickly enough. I had viral pneumonia in late 2016 and it apparently damaged my autonomic nervous system. That combined with the fact that poor circulation run in my family led me to have episodes where I would wake up in the middle of the night because my heart rate and blood pressure would go too low (the Lowest was in the 40bm range and my bp would by way lower than 90/60). My doctors thought it was everything from my asthma/allergies acting up to sleep apnea (I’m an unlikely candidate because a petite woman and don’t have my tonsil or adenoids), but it was just due to POTS. It’s not a rare condition, it’s just rarely known by lay folks and medical professionals alike. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think sleep issues can stem from both but for me, the solution to being an extremely light sleeper (ear plugs, sleep mask, very far room, etc,) for about 17 years was magnesium. I was having severe muscle cramps and someone suggested that I take magnesium, and to my amazement, the magnesium helped with the muscle aches and sleep issues. I can fall asleep now even when my husband is watching television, which would have never been possible in the past. I take the calcium/magnesium/zinc combo from Trader Joe’s each night and it works like a dream. 6-7 hours solid every single night now. I can also drink four cappuccinos a day and it doesn’t affect my sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be that your adrenals are stressed. Try to work on an even blood sugar all day - don’t eat or drink sweet stuff or caffeine. About an hour before bed time eat a small snack with carbs and fat. (Ex. A small sweet potato and a couple of slices of avocado) This supplies energy all night to your adrenals so you can sleep deeper. What you described is actually very common with chronic auto immune issues. Your adrenals work extra hard to keep things going and need more nutrients. That’s how I learned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
