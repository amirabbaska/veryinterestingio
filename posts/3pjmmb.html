<p>This issue came up between my mother and I. She'd always tell me sleeping too much just makes you more tired, my dad never commented on the subject.</p>
<p>I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder (genetically passed onto me through my mother, one of the most common mental disorders). The depressive stages of this mental disease lead to the person being exhausted and sleeping more. But no matter how much they sleep, they still feel terrible and sleep deprived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you're just dehydrated. Have a bottle of water beside you when you wake up. It will take that lethargic feeling away.</p>
<p>Edit: Another explanation is that oversleeping messes up with your circadian rythm (your &quot;sleep clock&quot;) which signals the brain that you're up and ready to go or travelling to dreamland</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PhD with expertise in insomnia here. /u/gangsecreto's edit is on the right track. Your &quot;sleep clock&quot; as they refer to it is actually a group of cells in a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We also refer to this as a circadian rhythm. Sleep is regulated by two processes, the &quot;sleep clock&quot; (your circadian rhythm) and a sleep drive (this builds throughout the day and is associated with a buildup of a neuromodulator called adenosine). If you &quot;oversleep&quot; your sleep drive may be low but your circadian rhythm is thrown off (it's regulated by consistency and especially waking up at the same time daily). In essence it's confused. This confusion causes some people to feel more rested and some people to feel more sleepy. One additional curve-ball in this is that if you &quot;oversleep&quot; you may sometimes be waking up in the middle of a sleep-cycle which will also cause you to feel sleepy for a period of time. </p>
<p>Thanks /u/smeeee for alerting me to this thread.</p>
<p>Edit:
tl;eli5. When you oversleep, your sleep/wake cycle, which is based on consistent wake up times, doesn't know whether to shit or go blind. (In the eli5 spirit :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/PainMatrix gave a pretty good answer already, but a more &quot;ELI5&quot; answer is that your body has natural high and low periods of energy that stay pretty consistent (they &quot;drift&quot; as you get older, but on a day-to-day scale, they're fairly rigid). &quot;That 2:30 feeling&quot; isn't just a marketing gimmick for 5 Hour Energy. Most people's highest levels of alertness come around 10am and 6pm, and their lowest levels around 4am, 2pm and 10pm. </p>
<p>If your body is used to being awake and active at 10 in the morning, but you sleep until 1 in the afternoon one day, you've basically woken up in the middle of a &quot;low-energy&quot; period and it takes a little while for your body to adjust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
