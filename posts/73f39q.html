		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean. Two different forms of your question:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> If you were to start walking from mean sea level (as defined as the average position of sea level at a given point over a several year period to account for tidal and storm variability) at a specific point to a specific mountain peak now vs 100 years from now, would the total vertical distance you travel be different?</p>
<p>Generally, yes. Because the total mass of water in the ocean is increasing and the volume is also increasing via thermal expansion, mean sea level is rising (in most places, there are important local variations due to variations in gravity, bathymetry, and isostatic rebound in response to melting of glaciers/ice sheets) the total vertical distance between mean sea level and mountain peaks will decrease between now and 100 years from now.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Will the elevation on maps of mountain peaks change between now and 100 years because of sea level rise?</p>
<p>No (with a caveat). While conversationally people refer to topographic height as a value above 'mean sea level', unless you're referencing an old map, this is not really the case in that these elevations are not referenced directly to measurements of sea level. When describing a position, whether that's a horizontal or vertical position, this position needs to be referenced to something. This is equivalent to simple plotting in cartesian coordinates where everything is referenced to the origin. When talking about geographic/topographic coordinates, the reference points are called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum" target="_blank">datum</a>. For heights, a <a href="http://gisgeography.com/vertical-datum/" target="_blank">vertical datum</a> is what we're concerned with and you can see from that link that we can kind of think of three broad categories, 'tidal datums', 'ellipsoidal datums', and 'geodetic datums' (also sometimes called 'orthometric datums'). While a tidal datum is tied to actual measurements of mean sea level height in several areas, a geodetic datum is tied to a specific point, that may or may not coincide with a place where we have measured mean tidal heights. For a geodetic datum, heights are essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthometric_height" target="_blank">orthometric heights</a>, so heights above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" target="_blank">geoid</a>, which is an equipotential gravitational surface which represents what sea level would be if only influenced by gravity and earth's rotation, then referenced to our zero coordinate which is specific to that datum. Ellispoidal datums are reference heights to an ellipsoid, so a mathematical approximation of the shape of the earth without topography. There are <a href="https://community.esri.com/groups/coordinate-reference-systems/blog/2014/08/14/mean-sealevel" target="_blank">lots</a> of different vertical datums that vary by place, for the US we currently use <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/vertical/" target="_blank">North American Vertical Datum of 1988</a> which is a geodetic datum. Because elevations are referenced to the height of a specific point (with corrections for the height of the geoid as a function of location) changes in sea level have no influence on the vertical datum. Now, the caveat would be that NOAA or the equivalent body for another country could decide in the future that they want to update their geodetic datum so that they choose a new zero point based on the new sea level height in some location, but there's not really a reason to do this. Vertical datums do get updated (though not incrementally, a vertical or horizontal datum is not changed once it's established, but a new one can be introduced, an example as described on several of those pages is the switch from the tidal datum of 1929 to the geodetic datum of 1988) but this is driven by better and more precise measurements of the gravitational field of the Earth and not changes in sea level, and in fact the US vertical datum <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/newdatums/index.shtml" target="_blank">is set to be replaced in 2022</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about from a barometric pressure point of view? If you’re running at 10,000’ ASL you feel the lack of pressure/less available oxygen - if the sea level somehow rose by 6,000’ would it then feel as if you’re running at 4,000’? </p>
<p>For example: if the world somehow went Water World enough and only the top of Mount Everest was sticking out above the waves it would feel like sea level today, right?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heights above sea level don't refer to the actual water surface they refer to a standard, the &quot;datum&quot;. The actual water surface goes up and down on all time scales, including year to year. Neither is the sea surface &quot;flat&quot; or spherical, it varies with gravity and with a variety of oceanographic effects like temperature, salinity and currents. These effects change over time and with seasons.</p>
<p>If the world sea level rises by a couple of meters that won't mean much of you're away from the sea so using the old datum won't matter.  If you're on the coast, it may be catastrophic.</p>
<p>The datum gets revised periodically, and there might be new standards of sea level ride takes off. So your height would be x above the 2050 Australian datum, or whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
