		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor, but my grandmother &quot;died in her sleep&quot; in a hospital. We knew it was coming for days. She didn't really do much for those days aside from occasionally reaching out. But by the last day she didn't move and wasn't conscious. Her pulse just kinda went from 90 to 0 from what I vaguely remember ( I was a little emotional so I wasn't watching the monitor) She was DNR. </p>
<p>I think that's what they call dying in your sleep. It's not an official thing as far as I can tell. Just a way to say that you weren't conscious in the moments before you stopped functioning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe they can by examining the body's position and the state of their muscles.  A forensic expert could examine the legs and arm muscles and tell how long they were in that position, by figuring out how long the body has been in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigor_mortis" target="_blank">rigor mortis</a>.  From there they can determine when the person died.  They can also tell whether or not the body had been moved after dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you get to a room and it's a normal room, no signs of fighting or struggle (like if the person rose up to get help, for example) and the person is still in bed in a normal sleeping position, you can assume that he/she never got up even, so you say &quot;died in their sleep&quot; just because the surroundings and circumstances allow you to conclude it. That doesn't mean necessairily the person didn't woke up, but just that it didn't have any strength left to fight or look for help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
