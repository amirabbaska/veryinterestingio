		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who are chronically sleep deprived have lower cognitive capability in scientific studies. After a long time of sleep deprivation, the body and brain will begin to &quot;get used&quot; to feeling tired, but the cognitive effects (and increased mortality) remain.</p>
<p>In other words: it <em>feels</em> like you get used to it, but you never do</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea, I was supposed to have an overnight sleep study, then come back for a titration study with the CPAP.</p>
<p>After about an hour or so, the sleep tech woke me up and told me we were putting the mask on then and there.</p>
<p>Apparently, I had an AHI of 81 or so over the course of a single hour... so basically, I didn't sleep - I just died for a little bit. I was also entering REM sleep almost immediately - I nearly skipped entire phases of sleep, I was so messed up (our estimate is that I went undiagnosed for about four years, and I've never slept well even before that).</p>
<p>After around six hours sleep, in an unfamiliar and, honestly, somewhat uncomfortable bed, hooked up to more wires than I care to admit, with a strange new hose and mask attached to my face like some kind of weird beneficial facehugger... I woke up feeling better than I had in <strong>years</strong>. </p>
<p>Apparently it takes about 12 cm^3 of air to keep my airway open... but holy hell do I feel better now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your sleep requirement is not a trainable characteristic, so no. Restricting your sleep in no way changes what your individual requirement actually is you merely become accustomed to a new, lower, level of performance as a result. You believe you are functioning ok but have in reality adjusted to a worse &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Why we sleep&quot; by Matthew Walker is an excellent, and eye-opening, read on this topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
