		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case you are asking about the &quot;market&quot; part of the stock market, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, Euronext, and other exchanges exist to provide &quot;liquidity&quot; to existing and new investors. Put simply, these are places for existing shareholders to sell shares (receive cash) and prospective shareholders to buy shares (pay cash).</p>
<p>Others in this thread have used a shipping expedition as an example. Let's say you invested £1,000 for a 1/5 share of a particular ship bound for India to get spices and return to Europe. Half way through the journey, you receive news that the ship successfully made it to India, loaded up with spices, and is now on its way home. There is still risk that the ship might sink on its way home, but the risk is now roughly half of what it was at the outset of the expedition. Let's say a new investor is now willing to buy your 1/5 share for £1,500. If you sell your share to the new investor, you make a £500 profit even if the ships sinks on the way home. On the other hand, you give up whatever profits you could have made if the ship does make it back successfully.  </p>
<p>A stock market is simply a place where buying and selling of these shares can be done on a regularized basis. There are rules that make shares trade-able (e.g. if you own one share of GE stock, it has the same value as everyone else's share of GE stock). Further, there are brokers (think of them as middle-men) that facilitate trading. Now, there are also electronic matching systems that can directly match buyers and sellers without the need for brokers. The goal of the stock market is to have the most efficient flow of buying and selling of shares for investors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stocks were invented as a way to share risk. European countries had trading expeditions going to Asia and Americas. These expeditions took months or years and were hugely expensive to fund but when successful they were absurdly profitable. The problem was that a ship could sink or get robbed by pirates, or a number of other problems.</p>
<p>The investors also had to stay solvent while waiting for the ship(s) to return.</p>
<p>At one point some very smart people in Netherlands figured that if they sold &quot;shares&quot; of these expeditions they could get many more people involved as investors, thereby the risk would be shared among a greater number of people/companies.</p>
<p>Once the expedition returned the company was dissolved and the profits, or losses, were divided up according to who owned what percentage of shares. Your reward was directly related to how much you invested.</p>
<p>Over time this mechanism evolved to companies in general, not just companies setup for trading expeditions.</p>
<p>Simply put it's a way to raise capital, across a large number of investors which all shares the risk and reward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say it costs you £5,000 to get a ship to sail to the Raj and back and you'll make £10,000 when it arrives in London. You have £5,000 to invest and put it in a single ship, the ship (sinks in a storm/gets taken by the damned French/gets taken by the damned Spanish/gets taken by pirates) you are down £5,000.  </p>
<p>Now lets say insted of investing in a single ship you own 100% you take 1/5 of 5 ships, owning 20% on each. All five leave London to go to the Raj and return with spice. One of the ships sinks/taken the other four return. You get a share of the profits proportional to your ownership, 1/5 of 4 ships carring £10,000 each meaning you get £8,000 an increase of £3,000.  </p>
<p>Now let's say all but one sank, you only get £2,000 back an decrease of £3,000 which is better than losing all £5,000.  </p>
<p>So let's invest in more ships with the £5,000. Say you buy a 2% stake in 50 ships (£100 into each). Of the 50 ships 47 return meaning you get £9,400 when they return.  </p>
<p>Losing a single ship when you own 100% means you drop £10,000<br />
Losing a single ship when you own 20% means you drop £2,000<br />
Losing a single ship when you own 2% means you drop £200<br />
By investing the same ammount into more ships for a lower percentage you don't have as big of a loss when a ship doesn't return. With the investment:profit ratio you need 25% of the ships to return to break even. It makes sense to own less % of more ships for this reason.  </p>
<p>Let's say you are a Captain of a merchant ship, you want to sail to the Raj to buy spice of the Indians and sell it to the English. It costs money, you need to pay the crew half their wage and have funds to buy the spice. Accept patronage from wealthy investors inreturn for them taking a share of the profits keeps you making money.  </p>
<p>It was highly successful for trade so other industries took it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies can raise money 4 ways. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sell more products (but this is largely uncontrollable)</li>
<li>Borrow money from banks (loans)</li>
<li>Borrow from people (bonds)</li>
<li>Sell off small pieces of the company (shares/stocks)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you own a piece of a company, you can sell it, or buy more of it - or even buy part of a different company.
The place you do this is on the stockmarket. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Businesses have a need to find investors to raise money to grow the company.  Without a stockmarket the best you can do is appeal to a relative few wealthy investors and hope they buy in.</p>
<p>With a stockmarket everyone knows where to go to find companies to invest in.  What's more, they now have access to millions of small investors rather than a few wealthy ones which can amount to the same thing.  This dramatically increases the pool of money available which spurs development.</p>
<p>Finally, for investors, the stockmarket acts as a price discovery mechanism.  Without the market valuations are more difficult.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
