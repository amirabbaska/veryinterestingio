		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saw a YouTube video explaining this a while ago. Basically planes are designed to be as light as possible and space is used as efficiently as possible. That means there isn't really spare space. Internet on planes are satellite based and as a result, require large antennas mounted to the top of the plane. With space so limited, often these antennas bulge out of the fuselage. Not only is this expensive to implement, but the aerodynamics of the plane become less efficient. That means you're burning more fuel for the same flight. That directly contributes to wifi prices being so high on planes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that the ways to get an internet connection to an airplane are more expensive than most other types of internet connections. Most in-flight internet providers use either a proprietary ground-based system (similar to a cell phone network, but with antennas aimed up instead of at the ground), or a satellite system. Both types of networks are really expensive to maintain and operate, and the ground-based systems have to be built just for airplanes.
Another reason is that the connection is usually pretty slow, so pricing can be used as a way to limit the number of people sharing that connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a bus or train, the wifi is backed by a cell tower.  If you're underground in a metro, sometimes you can see little microwave cell antennas in the ceiling, being the cell. This little cell on the ceiling is in turn backed by a fiber line or something.</p>
<p>Ships are too far away from any cell towers. and airplanes are out of range vertically, though you can sometimes see towers on takeoff or landing, after they let you turn it back on but before they've climbed too high. These need to use communication satellites, which are much more expensive than cells, and you usually pay by the MB.</p>
<p>My guess would be that flights are usually a necessity, so neither customer nor airline wants to pay for anything they don't have to.  Cruise ships, on the other hand, are luxuries, so they do things like 'free wifi' to make it seem more luxurious, then jack up the price of the ticket. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We might have wifi on all those modes of transport, but it is rarely free to the majority of the world. </p>
<p>The cruise I just came back from was AU$2/MB for cell-based wifi, or AU$134 for the ship's wifi for the 8-days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
