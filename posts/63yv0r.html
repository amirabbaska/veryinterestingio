		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IANAL but I do mod a site that has to deal with this. The laws are rather iffy. In Canada and Great Britain (but i don't know if that includes the whole UK) it IS illegal to own/view such images (and if nothing else they can be the basis to search your computer or belongings for more 'solidly' illegal material). In the US it is mostly not illegal as long as it is fictional and not realistic. The site i mod for is hosted in the US and for years we instantly removed anything that depicted the characters as children, or explicitly called them younger than 14 (but also based on art style to exclude the 1000 year old 6 year old bullshit). </p>
<p>We have since allowed the loli/shota/cub stuff but only quarantined behind a secondary filter in a community you have to sub to to see, same for bestiality themed content: you only see it if you really really opt to and if it's anywhere else we burn it with fire.</p>
<p>The reason for the change was that it was figured to be far enough away from the crime. A picture of murder is not a murder - the crime is killing, not seeing it - a picture of a naked child is a naked child - the crime is 'sexually viewing' a child - but a picture of a fake naked child is not a naked child. It is blurry as all fuck. However, and this is where the admin talked a bit to a lawyer but i don't have the conversation anymore, there is a weird legal bit where the more realistic it is the more blurred the line becomes; shota-cub is pretty far from a real kid being harmed but editing a picture of a 12 year old to make them seem sexual is pretty close to a kid being harmed. The same rule weirdly enough goes for bestiality themed drawings and animations; the closer it looks to being real the closer it is to the crime itself. </p>
<p>The main reason is that children are &quot;Our Children&quot; and being soft on any issue like that is political suicide; so where other things can still be called art as soon as kids are involved the art claim gets overruled by the &quot;My Kid&quot; claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It simply is that the possession of sexualised images of children is illegal in and of itself.  With rape and murder however it is the act that is illegal and possessing images of that act doesn't constitute a crime in and of itself (outside of being the one to take them or deliberately concealing them from the police or various other crimes like that).</p>
<p>There are certain concessions made for non-photographic work imported from outside the country for non-mainstream entertainment (manga, anime, visual novels, etc.) but for most of these they'll adjust the ages of characters up to 18 where possible in translated versions or downplay the sexualisation through careful editing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems no one is answering the heart of this question which is &quot;Why is it ok for violent acts but not this?&quot;</p>
<p>I believe it has to do with the majority of individuals not having an innate attraction to adolescents. The concern is that with exposure to sexualized images of children people will begin to sexualize adolescents when they otherwise would not and therefore lead to more instances of sexual abuse in real life. </p>
<p>In regards to violence on the other hand, while it is not accepted it is understood to be part of our natural mental makeup. Showing images in regards to violence in essence isn't going to instill any feelings that weren't seen to be naturally there in the first place. Now whether it manages to incite more violence or not is another debate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laws are sometimes based on emotion and not actual logic because laws are made by people.  Many people including law makers believe if sexualized images of children were freely legal, it would promote more danger to the welfare of children.  This idea is as antiquated as prohibition laws in the US for alcohol. What it amounts to logically is a thought crime. This does not somehow apply to murder and gore. </p>
<p>The same idea of laws based on emotion go for hate crimes. The idea is that for some reason already heinous crimes are &quot;more&quot; illegal now because the intent was based on hate. The idea of making possession of pornographic imagery illegal is akin to the war on drugs or making prostitution illegal. What we are doing is not attacking the root of the problem which is the heart and mind. </p>
<p>Back to the CP problem and why it is a thought crime.  If I view sexual imagery of children, the thought is I have the &quot;potential&quot; to harm children or promote the harming of children. So I must be jailed for the &quot;potential&quot; and not for the crime of raping children. </p>
<p>Let's use that logic for something else such as murder, which we should inherently think is very bad. In a world of complete command and control, we would make any imagery of killing illegal including video games because it has the &quot;potential&quot; of spreading violence and murder. </p>
<p>Please try and convince me otherwise in a logical manner, or just let the flaming and down votes commence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
