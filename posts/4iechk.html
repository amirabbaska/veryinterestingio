		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing does exist and is called an optical antenna. However, unlike their RF counterparts, optical antennas have not yet quite made it out of research labs. The reason for this difference is that it is much harder to make efficient antennas that are sensitive to visible light than to longer wavelength EM radiation (as in the micro-wave and radio-wave range). </p>
<p>Deep down, all antennas have one key goal: to shuffle EM radiation between a localized transmitter/emitter and spread-out waves (far field radiation), as shown in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YWTZ9GY.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a>. (I took the figure from <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v5/n2/abs/nphoton.2010.237.html" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which gives a good introduction to the field.) In the receiving mode, the antenna would efficiently funnel in these far field waves and transfer this energy to the receiver. In the transmission mode, the antenna would instead take the energy from the transmitter and transform it into far field waves. Everything I have described so far works mostly the same for radio and optical antennas.</p>
<p>However, where we start running into trouble is the fact that a good antenna has a size comparable to the wavelength it operates in. If the ideal size of radio antennas falls in the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eu4hMnB.jpg" target="_blank">range of multiple meters</a>, for optical antennas, we would need to hit <a href="http://i.imgur.com/l0B0zML.jpg" target="_blank">a range of ~100nm</a>. As you can see in the last image, fabrication wise, we can make structures of the size we need, even if the actual manufacturing can be challenging. The biggest problem, however, is that the electronic properties don't simply scale down with the size in a straightforward way.</p>
<p>At the low frequencies of radio-waves we can treat the antenna as an almost perfect conductor. On the other hand, at optical frequencies we are nowhere close to this idealized case. In these small optical antennas, EM radiation causes electrons to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/t7aKh01.png" target="_blank">slosh and back collectively</a> in what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon" target="_blank">plasmonic modes</a>. This sloshing causes a large fraction of the energy to be lost as heat (it's a form of resistive heating). Moreover the exact nature of these plasmonic modes strongly depends on the exact shape of the antenna. As a result, the design and fabrication of these antennas becomes much more complicated, as is placing the transmitter/receiver in just the right spot near the antenna.  </p>
<p><strong>Tl;DR:</strong> Optical antennas are possible and they are being developed (and used) in research labs. However, making the damn things is hard for two main reasons. 1) It's harder to design and make structures at the nano scale. 2) While the metal in RF antennas is mostly a boring conductor, physics gets much messier when you put small chunks of metal under optical frequencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to this party. Lots of people have correctly mentioned the existence of optical scale antennas.</p>
<p>However lots of people are confusing optical detectors with antennas. The idea of an antenna is to convert free space electrical fields into measurable electrical signal. When you are working with rf frequencies it is easy to measure as a Ghz sampler can easily process the lower MHz signal.</p>
<p>However no samplers exist that can process the 14THz signal in the optical range. What you have is power detectors such as diodes that rectify the signal. At most you have some optical processing such as a phase detection loop but in the end you get a signal, not a waveform. This is the main difference when you move from microwaves to the infrared frequencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if the antenna is the right size for the visible frequencies of electromagnetic waves, which should be about half a wavelength long, which for visible light would be about 250 nm or Â¼ of a micron. This is  called a 'nanoplasmonic antenna' and yes, it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A regular TV antenna converts electromagnetic waves in space to current in an electrical conductor. As the frequency gets higher, the conductor is replaces with a waveguide. The antenna is then more a <em>horn</em> to capture the electromagnetic waves and guide them from the 'antenna' to the receiver or from transmitter to the antenna.</p>
<p>As light is in the TeraHertz range, this is especially true for light. The antenna is then an optical telescope, and the 'wire' is a waveguide for light. Usually an optical fibre.</p>
<p>The light is amplified in an optical fiber amplifier, and may be fed to other kinds of receivers or analyzers. </p>
<p>This setup is for example used to find the distance to the moon. Retromirrors are left on the moon. A laser is connected to the telescope (antenna) with a fiber, and the light is sent up, and reflected back. The telescope receives the reflection, and guides it into the fiber, back to the receiver. This may be called a LIDAR and is the light version of the RADAR. The antennas, waveguides, receivers and transmitters for light have been around for a decades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
