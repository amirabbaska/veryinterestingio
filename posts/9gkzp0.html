		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here.</p>
<p>In complete darkness the eyes almost fully relax their focus (accommodation). Some amount remains, known as tonic accommodation, which varies from person to person. This is inherent to the person's visual system and present unless they are dead!</p>
<p>Note that focussing on infinity and fully relaxing the focus are, in terms of accommodation, the same thing.</p>
<p>Accommodation is the system by which the eyes move their focal point closer to the body e.g. to read. At optical infinity no accommodation is required and the system is, in theory at least, fully relaxed. Is this the type of focus you meant?</p>
<p>Vergence is the system by which the eyes move closer together to point at a near object. This works a bit differently, though the two, along with pupil dilation, are linked in terms of the nerve supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In flight training there is the idea of 'empty field myopia'.</p>
<p>If you are looking out into an empty sky, paying attention (looking out) but not focusing on anything in particular the eye will focus at around 1-2m.</p>
<p>This can be an issue so the training suggests looking at a cloud, a landmark, even the edge of the wings to avoid bringing focus in and hence missing another aircraft in the sky due to the short focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you close your eyes for sleeping as an example the relaxed position of your eyes is up and out, any stimulus that could make the eye move is supressed to allow rest. This is why as you wake up in the morning the first thing you notice is a brief moment of dyplopia (seeing double). Your eyes are looking far off to each outer orbital corner and they re align again in that moment.
When you stare into complete darkness there is something called focused into infinity. Which means the main focus of both eyes goes paralel from each other, and keeping the muscle tone balanced (so each eye doesnt loose alignment)
But as it is in complete darkness there are other optical mechanisms taking place. In darkness the magnocelular portion of the nerve fiber layer in the retina gets stimulated and you start sensing small stimulus of shape and movement across all the outer retina region ( this is useful for staying in alert by paying attention to the corners of your vision rather than detail) as you pay attention more to this rather than focusing eyes the eye starts a divergence stimulus (very small and weaker than a convergence stimulus) and starts causing misalignment,thats why in darkness we feel small movement stimulus which are not real ( sometimes after i shut the lights and go to bed i stared at the ceiling and i feel like the ceiling is moving) because the eye tends to diverge and creating a small misalignment.
As to why the eyes goes up and out to rest is because of how the muscles are inserted on the eyeball,the muscles coming from the back of the orbital area travels in 45 degree angle from the center of the head. but they insert on the eyeball in a 23 degree angle from that 45 angle so in order to maintain the eyes alignment they always have to have a minimun muscle tone to keep looking up front.
Sorry english is not my native language but i hope you can understand it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's similar to pilots in aircraft - a big empty field of view but you're looking for other aircraft...  see and avoid etc.  We tend to focus pretty close though when there are no visual cues.  Maybe 20 to 50 meters? It's a well known problem so you're taught to make yourself focus out into the distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
