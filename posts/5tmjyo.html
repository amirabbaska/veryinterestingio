		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keeping cash reserves is totally normal and expected for many companies as a way to help diminish risk.  What if something happens and you need money? Well you've got it</p>
<p>Apple is particularly unique though -- because the amount of cash reserves they have is wildly high, absurdly so for their type of business and industry.</p>
<p>While Apple won't discuss why they do it, except in broad and generic terms, financial analysts have several ideas, of which may or may not be true, but are potential reasons, and all can be true to a degree. Such as:</p>
<p>A) Apple wants to do some large scale, primarily cash acquisitions of other companies (buying CBS, Disney, or Netflix have all been discussed).</p>
<p>B) The money isn't readily available to spend, that is its behind some complicated tax laws and such and may not be easily accessible, as such, it its highest value is to be as reserves, as if they tried to spend it, the value would decrease.</p>
<p>C) Apple is saving up for future products, sitting on the money for investments later, right now things are good, but if they need to smash, fast, new production of something new, the cash will heavily heavily lower the time needed to create a new high-quality product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally Steve Jobs, as &quot;iCEO&quot; (interim CEO) saved and built up the reserves (even against the pleas of investors) to prevent a takeover and buy-out, as he saw the value in the company beyond the cash they had on the books and projected revenue forecasts.
Right now they say it's to keep them stable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taxes. The main reason they have a bunch of money outside the country is that it's too darn expensive to bring it back to the country. The money is sitting in piggy banks in other countries where the government's do not ask for too much in the form of income taxes. Sure, they could bring that cash back to the here  (called repatriation), but then they would have to pay income tax on that money, which is effectively 35% on amounts that large. </p>
<p>So they have a choice: keep the money wherever it currently is, or bring it home and pay $83 billion in taxes (ignoring all the extra tax planning they could do). </p>
<p>Yes, the other comments about diminishing risk and not having projects to invest in are probably true to a certain degree, but tax is the main reason. I think I recall in 2016 Apple raised debt in the US to finance expansion. Why do this when they have $246 billion overseas? Taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well looking at Apple's stats on Wikipedia, their revenue, total amount of money coming in, in 2015 was about 215 billion, and their net income, the profit on that was 45 billion.  That implies their operating costs for a year were give or take 170 billion.  They own assets, property of some sort, worth around 320 billion, and the equity they have, the value of those assets minus any liabilities like paying back a loan type obligations or tax burdens or just outstanding debts for things they bought &quot;accounts payable&quot; or salary obligations or warranties (because a warranty is a contract that exists and if the warranty is called in they need to have money), is 128 billion.  So that means their liabilities are around 200 billion (obviously they're not all needing to be paid next year, or right now or whenever but they exist).   </p>
<p>So having 240 billion in cash reserves is pretty reasonable, they have a ton of operating expenses, it protects them from having a really bad year or two. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They likely don't have anything at the time that they believe will deliver a high enough return to make it worth investing. They are also likely waiting for some direction on US Tax code for repatriating the money. If rates or lowered or a tax holiday is granted, investors are going to expect significant dividends from these companies, it's much easier to do with the liquidity of cash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
