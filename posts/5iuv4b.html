		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You experience your waking moments as they are determined by tiny changes in the chemical composition of the teensy tiny spacings between cells in your brain. These chemicals are the messengers that your brain cells use to communicate with each other. </p>
<p>Some brain chemicals make you sleepy. Others make you awake. Still others make you feel happy and calm, while others make you angry or anxious. These chemical's effects overlap in mind-bogglingly complex feedback loops that permit you to experience the subtle differences and indescribable shadings of your feelings and emotions in real time.</p>
<p>However, experiencing all this life is tiresome for you brain. Spilling brain chemicals for the purpose of communication is actually kind of a wasteful process, and makes for a lot of clean up that needs taken care of for you to feel good and function properly. This is where sleep comes in. During sleep, the clean up process flushes out used up brain chemicals and replaces it with clean, refreshing cerebrospinal fluid. Sleep is effectively an oil change for your brain.</p>
<p>We just now live in such a convenient time in human history that we can get our sleep oil change whenever we choose. Falling asleep used to be a problem for us, however. Being asleep when we did not want to be used to present possibility for injury or death from other predators. So we have designated certain brain chemicals as our &quot;awake&quot; chemicals, some of which include dopamine and norepinephrine. Whenever you are trying to keep yourself awake, you are trying to trigger a brief release of these excitatory brain chemicals to stave off sleep for a little longer. Now releasing more brain chemicals doesn't perform the function of the brain oil change. Only sleep does that, and so you don't actually feel rested from a spike in norepinephrine, but you will feel more alert and less sleepy. </p>
<p>You can consciously choose to expose yourself to anxiety-causing stimuli to trigger the release of excitatory, so-called &quot;fight or flight,&quot; brain chemicals. So when you're trying to stay up and you watched a super scary movie or something, your brain responds with &quot;oh shit, that scary movie thing is going to eat me if I fall asleep. Better get real anxious and keep this lazy body conscious in case we need backup.&quot; The resulting release of excitatory brain chemicals causes your heart rate to increase, spikes your blood sugar, and affectively keeps you awake for a slightly longer period of time so that you can ensure that the movie monster isn't going to eat your eyeballs with a grapefruit spoon if you go fully unconscious and pursue your nightly brain oil change.</p>
