		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sapana V. trained as a cancer biologist specializing in inherited risk genetics for acute leukemia. She joined the State Department's Biosecurity Engagement Program (BEP) as a AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow in 2015. Her primary BEP responsibilities include setting priorities and implementing programs in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, participating in interagency meetings on biological policy issues, and managing BEP's annual budget. In January 2016, she was promoted to Acting Deputy Team Chief for BEP.  Prior to joining the State Department, she was a Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy fellow and research associate at the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine where she helped develop the &quot;Ovarian Cancers: Evolving Paradigms in Research and Care&quot; report.  She holds a Ph.D. in Cancer Biology from the University of Chicago and a B.S. in Biology and English from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>She'll be on starting at 2 PM ET (19 UT)!</p></div></div>
