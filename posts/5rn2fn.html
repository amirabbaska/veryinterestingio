		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>everything is breaking down slowly. its a fact of entropy. dust is just the very small particles that come from that breakdown. these particles are light enough to float in the air. changes in the air such as a change in the temperature, pressure, humidity and turbulence mean that the amount of these particles in the air changes with time. when the air cant hold as many particles  anymore it deposits them in a thin layer on any (usually horizontal) surface. since the adhesive properties of a surface with a high surface area are greater than that of a smooth surface more particles will stick to the surface rather than be reabsorbed into the air when the temperature, pressure, humidity and turbulence etc shift back. stuff like furniture polish contains an anti sticky substance to stop the dust sticking in the first place so that it can be reabsorbed by the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I read a great book about dust. I recommend it. This:</p>
<p><em>The Secret Life of Dust</em> by Hannah Holmes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some see dust as dull and useless stuff. But in the hands of author Hannah Holmes, it becomes a dazzling and mysterious force; Dust, we discover, built the planet we walk upon. And it tinkers with the weather and spices the air we breathe. Billions of tons of it rise annually into the air--the dust of deserts and forgotten kings mixing with volcanic ash, sea salt, leaf fragments, scales from butterfly wings, shreds of T-shirts, and fireplace soot. Eventually, though, all this dust must settle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dust is any free floating particulate matter, usually mineral or clay carried on the wind but it could also come from paper and clothing. However the majority of the dust in most households is not dust at all, it's dander which is a collection of dead skin cells, hair, and the stuff our bodies cast off through daily activities. </p>
<p>Your skin is constantly growing and old dead cells are shed every time we move, scratch, touch something, etc. The dead cells are very small and float freely in air currents until settling on your un-used copy of Battlefield Earth. </p>
<p>The dust outside and in the wind is usually from dirt and sand but what is dirt exactly? What is clay is another good question and the answer is metals, silicates, and minerals. Much of the clay you find outdoors is made up of things like  aluminum compounds and silica. Sand is usually made up of ground up minerals. And of course soil is dirt that also contains organic matter like decaying plant and insect matter, compost, manure, etc. </p>
<p>When  an area has a good covering of plants and dense root systems and plant coverage dust is kept to a minimum because the roots of all those plants act like a net that holds the top soil together. When land is cleared though it exposes the top soil to the elements and the wind can carry it for thousands of miles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
