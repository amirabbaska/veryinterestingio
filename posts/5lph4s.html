		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To fall asleep you need to be both tired and relaxed, as you start to think about falling asleep and it takes too long you become nervous and try to force your body into sleep mode, to which your body senses an imminent danger and responds with fight or flight, releasing adrenaline and making sure you're awake enough to escape the danger that awaits you, even though that's the opposite of what you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are neurons that release the hormones that provide you with wakefulness, and different hormones that help slow your body down and put you to sleep. It is my understanding that these cells have no concept of days of the week or other arbitrary measurements of time, they are purely operating on your circadian rhythm. They cannot reprogram to make you sleepy at 9PM on Thursday, and keep you wakeful until 11PM on Friday. They need consistency. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day, your energy levels will be consistent, and you will get very tired when it's bed time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety caused by stress hormones that until the advent of the modern age would have helped a person work longer hours under pressure to capture more prey or avoid or flee an invading tribe. Now a days stress is often caused by issues that can't be solved by just working a few more hours in a day. That insomnia is a survival instinct. But today I think it's important to look at what is causing. You stress in life and better create a plan to manage those issues to find relief. Just my personal observations about difficulties sleeping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It pretty much boils down to a lack of melatonin. You need melatonin to sleep. Now, there might be a whole list of reasons why your body isn't releasing melatonin at 'a reasonable time'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell scientists have demonstrated that human beings are not designed like robots to turn on and off and go to sleep whenever it's most convenient for us. Humans traditionally slept in 4 hours blocks not eight hours. Now that we're forced into a modern world where we're expected to be awake all day our bodies are not equiped to shut off whenever we want them too.</p>
<p>As others have stated there are ways to help your body fit into the modern world sleep mold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
