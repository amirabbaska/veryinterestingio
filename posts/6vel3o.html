		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very cool way of looking at clouds is picturing them as the effect when warm moist air and cold air mix. Add in the fact that warm air rises because it's less dense, and warm sea-level-pressure air can hold more dissolved invisible moisture than cold lower-pressure air, and you have your ingredients to a flat-bottomed cloud.</p>
<p>First, what makes clouds visible? In a very easily repeatable experiment which you can see in just about any nature documentary when big mammals are doing stuff in a winter somewhere, their breath is very visible and forms a little cloud until it cools down and dissipates. </p>
<p>What happened there is &quot;fog&quot;, and its cause was warm moist air in the animal's breath holds more water than cold air, and when it cools down it has to surrender that moisture. So a region of warm moist air entered a cold zone and fell below the &quot;dew point&quot;, the point when the moistness it was holding condensed out and formed tiny visible droplets. Lowered air pressure can also helps this condensation effect, which is why you'll see a little tiny cloud form on its wingtips when a jet fighter go fast enough because the air pressure there is really low.</p>
<p>So now let's look at clouds. </p>
<p>Air generally gets cooler as you climb into the sky, and its pressure reduces. Sometimes it's not very disturbed and forms a clean gradient of temperature and pressure in the sky, both going down uniformly as you climb. On certain summery days when conditions are right, the level of the &quot;dew point&quot; is at a very flat, even height in the sky because the combination of temperature and reduced pressure is at a not-very-mixed-up consistent attitude.</p>
<p>So the sun shines, and warms stuff on the surface. If it's humid, warm moist air starts rising and rising... and breaks THROUGH that consistent dew point layer. </p>
<p>The result? It condenses to cloud just above that specific &quot;dew point&quot; layer. And you get a cloud with a flat bottom.</p>
<p>To extend this, if the updraft is strong enough, moist air keeps shooting up and feeding the cloud's growth until you get highly energetic cloud systems with all sorts of cool stuff like rain, hail, lightning, thunder... and tornadoes (except they can sometimes be not so cool).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here relating to the cloud microphysics but I'd like to add another important factor that controls the type of flat bottom cumulus clouds you often see; the atmospheric boundary layer. During the day the air in the bottom 300 metres to 1-2km is very well mixed. Surface heating causes local turbulent eddies which mix the temperature and water vapour. Let's say the boundary layer is 1km, if you took a parcel of air from the surface and lifted it to 500m or 990m, the water vapour in it would not condense so you can't make a cloud. However, the surface heating only extends so far up into the atmosphere and at the top of the boundary layer is where the temperature gradient begins to change, and hence, where clouds can begin to form. If the boundary layer is a uniform height over a large area, you can get a field of clouds <a href="http://weather.ou.edu/~smglenn/cumulus.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are viewing is the lifting condensation level. Warm water vapor rises as a gas, but then at a certain point, the air can no longer hold the amount of water in vapor form, so it condenses it. This level will be more or less constant. This is same reason you see clouds and rain form on the windward side of the mountain, except instead of heat causing the air and water vapor to rise, it's topography</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like oil sitting on water. The denser, warmer air is pulled down by gravity and essentially acts like liquid with the colder, less-dense air floats to the top. Different cloud densities are sitting on top of layers of air with greater density. That's why there are the different types of clouds at different altitudes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clouds look flat on the bottom because in any local area the adiabatic (expansion cooling) lapse rate is about the same. This means as water vapour laden air rises it all tends to reach the saturation point (forms cloud) at the same temperature (and that generally occurs at the same level in a local area).</p>
<p>On top (cumulus) clouds look puffy because of the turbulence created by convection mixes the air just like water boiling in a pot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
