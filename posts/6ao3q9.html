		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I have been watching Cosmos by Neil DeGrasse Tyson again recently and, after he sparked my interest about escape velocity, I began to Google and try to find what it would take for the sun to escape the Milky Way. The equation for escape velocity being √2GM/r, and knowing that the Sun does not sit at the edge of the Milky Way, I began to wonder: If you're deeper in the ground (on Earth) does the escape velocity change. The radius effectively lowers, which would make the escape velocity more. However, the mass put into the equation also lowers, which will make the escape velocity less. So, what would happen in a realistic scenario? Would the escape velocity be higher or lower or am I completely wrong about this whole thing? If you have any ideas, I'd love to know.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Escape speed at distance <em>r</em> is found in the same way as for the exterior escape speed. A particle escapes to infinity if its total energy is 0. (The zero of the potential is set at infinity and total energy E = 0 means the particle is at rest at infinity.) The deeper inside the potential well the particle is, the higher the escape speed. The interior of Earth has a higher potential than its exterior. So the interior escape speed continues to increase as r --&gt; 0. Precisely, we have the following.</p>
<hr />
<p>To lowest-order, Earth is approximately a homogeneous sphere of mass <em>M</em> and radius <em>R</em>. Hence the gravitational potential is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U(r) = (-GM/2R)(3 - r^(2)/R^(2))    if r &lt; R</p>
<p>U(r) = -GM/r    if r &gt; R</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the particle is initially at some interior distance <em>r</em>, then its total energy is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E = mv^(2)/2 - (GMm/2R)(3 - r^(2)/R^(2))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting E = 0 and solving for <em>v</em> gives the interior escape speed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>v<em><em>esc</em></em> = √[(GM/R)(3 - r^(2)/R^(2))]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this treats the mass of Earth as if it were interacting only gravitationally. That is, we pretend particles can orbit inside Earth and that there really isn't any interior structure like a molten core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So another way of looking at this (not that the other answers aren't great, but this is how I came to a solution initially) is weird but effective. Imagine a tunnel going down into the Earth and the graph of velocity versus time of something in this tunnel escaping Earth's gravity. You know that once it breaches the surface that it has to have the surface escape velocity (v). We know that past the surface the velocity will be &lt;v. We also know that acceleration will keep applying in the same direction which means our graph of v vs t won't have any cusps or discontinuity (edit: or most importantly, changes of direction) , so below the surface the velosity must be &gt;v (ie the escape velocity is higher when below the surface). If you're a fan of calculus this gets you the answer without even needing to know the equations.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>That equation assumes that all of the mass is below you. When you're inside the Earth, the mass farther away from the center than you are doesn't affect you gravitationally (it cancels out). But as you move up towards the surface, gravity gets stronger, since there is more and more mass below you. This means that a velocity that would let you escape from the surface with a certain radius and mass will not let you escape from underground, even if the effective radius and mass you're experiencing is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there is something that's not being pointed out, the <strong>escape velocity</strong> is your instantaneous velocity at that distance away from the <strong>M</strong> </p>
<p>It's somewhat misleading if it's not explained correctly. If you fly a rocket ship from the core versus the surface...it doesn't make sense that it needs to be traveling <em>faster</em> when it reached the same altitude measured from the surface. e.g. you are at flying from -10km below ground versus flying from surface, you'll need the same velocity at 10km above ground to get into the orbit or out of the gravitational pull. </p>
<p>So no, you don't need to travel faster if you are from the core. But yes, if you want to have an instant velocity that'll let you escape the gravitational pull in the instant, then you'll need a higher instant velocity versus at the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the escape velocity be exactly the same whether you start 5km under surface, on the surface or 5km above the surface?</p>
<p>The only difference would be how far you need to travel until reaching the point where the escape velocity must be high enough to, well, escape.</p>
<p>Ergo, starting below the surface just means you need even more fuel, ergo more costly and screws with the rocket equation since adding more fuel is more weight which requires more fuel to accelerate it which means more weight .... etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
