I understand the need for more living space, so we build upwards. What I don't understand is that every time a new building goes up, the rent for that building is automatically set at a relatively high price (around $2-3k/month not including utilities). Supply and demand states that when supply increases, cost should decrease. Yet for these apartments, it seems that the more supply there is, the higher the cost.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the demand is still much, much higher than the supply.    Part of this is because real estate in American cities is a pretty good place to store a lot of wealth if you live overseas.  It can't be confiscated easily by whatever your local government is, and you can be pretty sure the value will stay high.  Add those types to the massive number of people who want to live in big cities and will find a way to make it pay, and there's enough demand to keep costs high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost does not decrease just because the supply increases.</p>
<p>Since the demand is great, and so disproportionately higher than the supply, whenever there exists apartments on the market they still fetch a premium.</p>
<p>Even if a whole new building is made which might seem like a lot of new supply, it is not enough to saturate the market, which is what would have to happen to lower the price.  Everyone who wanted an apartment would have to already have one, then any newer ones made could be more affordable since the market is not in high demand anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Supply and demand states that when supply increases, cost should decrease.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's true that when 5,000 brand new buildings are built across the US with higher rent, 5,000 older buildings may decrease in rent because there has been an increase in the supply of apartments <strong>in the whole market</strong>. The other apartments that now need to decrease their price are older, and possibly not even in the same city.</p>
<p>Individual city governments and businesses want to offer nice apartments to attract wealthier residents that pay more taxes and stimulate the local economy with more spending.</p>
<p>tl;dr: A supply increase generally causes a cost decrease <strong>as a whole</strong> across the entire market, but not on a <strong>micro</strong> scale for an individual apartment complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supply and demand as others have said—NYC has attracted a lot of wealthy residents and foreigners as it has been remade in the last few decades after the decay of the 70s and 80s. </p>
<p>Worth noting that NYC has built so many luxury units in recent years that it's actually putting a downward pressure on mid-range units (lower rent, free months, upgraded amenities, etc) for the first time in over a decade and rents are going down—slightly—overall. I recently moved into a mid-range 2-bedroom in Harlem (~$2500) and it included a W/D, free month of rent, no fee, and up to a $1000 credit on my rent to buy furniture. </p>
<p>&quot;Luxury&quot; buildings I consider like $3500, at a minimum, in Manhattan from what I've seen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact that you cannot afford living in these apartments doesn’t mean others cannot. There is a lot of demand, more than there is supply, hence why the price is increasing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
