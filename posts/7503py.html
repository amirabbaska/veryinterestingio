		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, didn't expect there to be that many votes/comments. Thanks, guys! I read the majority of the comments, &amp; will continue to read more tonight. Someone in the comments posted <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/rainwater-harvesting.aspx" target="_blank">this US gov't page</a> that points out state-specific rainwater harvesting laws if anyone wants to read if their state has one. Majority of them seem to be very vague, which tells me it's likely city-to-city specific as well (thanks for the link btw!).
From reading the comments, it seems that Colorado has the strictest laws regarding rainwater harvesting per resident in the US. I asked this question because I was thinking of putting a rainwater barrel out in the future and also wondered why rainwater can be owned by any one entity. I'm honestly shocked that there are that many laws governing water access, but I guess it does make sense in this day &amp; age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in Colorado, every drop of water that falls from the sky or melts into a creek is ultimately owned by someone. It is also not that long since the last drought, when we were not allowed to water yards or wash cars at home, so a lot of people here are water-aware by default. </p>
<p>I own a house in a rural subdivision that gets its water from a creek, based on a water rights contract from the 70s, but the state is threatening to shut off every well in the subdivision if we don't mitigate evaporation and run-off. </p>
<p>They're not joking, water rights agreement be damned. The association has already gone deep into debt to pay for earth movers to come out and convert our lake into a wetlands with no standing water, and we're still not in the clear. The other option is to own a house with no source of water, so what can we do besides comply with the demands of the state?</p>
<p>The state is also actively using satellite data and planes to survey the state, looking for unauthorized ponds and other water collection, and forcing people to drain ponds that have existed for decades, because the water in those unauthorized ponds is &quot;owned&quot; by someone else. </p>
<p>So yeah, water is serious business here in Colorado, but I think we did recently get permission for each house in the state to be allowed to collect one barrel of rainwater per year, so that's something, I guess.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of ditch water from Cottonwood Creek being carried over a stream from Cottonwood Creek that I saw last week. I thought it was a pretty good example of how we really care about our water rights in Colorado, to the point where we won't allow stream water and ditch water to mix once they have been split off, even though it all comes from the same creek. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who owns the river? Everyone, it's a public resource and no one has a monopoly on it. It's managed by the government for issues like right of way, pollution dumping, and what you can use it for.</p>
<p>Everyone owns it has has rights to use it.  Like farmers can pull off so much water for crops.  </p>
<p>But what about the upstream little rivers that feed into it? Same thing.</p>
<p>But what about the source that feeds into those little rivers? ....well that's rain water.  </p>
<p>Where water rights are a big deal, not letting water flow down stream is considered stealing from those people. And so rain water outs treated the same.   </p>
<p>Legally, the system is really old and a real mess.  Read &quot;The Water Knife&quot; for a dramaticized account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's 100% legal in 42 states with restricted legality in only 8 states due to water rights. For example you can only collect up to 150 gallons of rainwater using your personal roof in Colorado, and this was from a law that passed in January of this year. Before that, you couldn't have a rainwater system because the state of CO owns all of the states water rights. It all comes down to who claims ownership of the water in the state.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that collecting too much rain water can screw the people who are downstream.</p>
<p>There are farms and communities/cities that rely on water from rivers and lakes. If people upstream collect too much rain water, then less water runs into the rivers and lakes. Now the people who rely on those rivers and lakes have a water shortage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
