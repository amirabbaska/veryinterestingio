		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not my field of expertise (otolaryngology), though, in 2014 a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0194599814545325" target="_blank">comprehensive review and clinical guidelines</a> were published in <em>Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery</em>.</p>
<p>It includes, amongst many other notable portions on the pathology, the current understanding of the disease, the treatment options, and further avenues of exploration and clinical management of patients with the disease.</p>
<p>They classify Primary and Secondary tinitus as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primary tinnitus is used to describe tinnitus that is idiopathic and may or may not be associated with SNHL <em>[sensorineural hearing loss]</em>. Although there is currently no cure for primary tinnitus, a wide range of therapies has been used and studied in attempts to provide symptomatic relief. These therapies include education and counseling, auditory therapies that include hearing aids and specific forms of sound therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medications, dietary changes and supplements, acupuncture, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>
<p>Secondary tinnitus is tinnitus that is associated with a specific underlying cause (other than SNHL) or an identifiable organic condition. It is a symptom of a range of auditory and nonauditory system disorders that include simple cerumen impaction of the external auditory canal, middle ear diseases such as otosclerosis or Eustachian tube dysfunction, cochlear abnormalities such as Ménière’s disease, and auditory nerve pathology such as VS. Nonauditory system disorders that can cause tinnitus include vascular anomalies, myoclonus, and intracranial hypertension. Management of secondary tinnitus is targeted toward identification and treatment of the specific underlying condition and is not the focus of this guideline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper is rather technical in looking into clinician practice and epidemiology, but it does give a very thorough breakdown of tinnitus as a physical malady. Understanding the specific pathology of the patient allows for more effective treatment. Unfortunately, this has the effect of splitting tinnitus into many subgroups of categories, though it may be a good place for OP to start to understand why this is a more difficult question to answer than he might've anticipated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why don't we do this naturally? Well, tinnitus is often not a constant ringing, but can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633109/" target="_blank">intermittent or changing</a>.</p>
<p>I myself have tinnitus, and I've had it for as long as I can remember. I find the pitch changes a lot throughout the day, but I've always been able to filter it out; although, if I concentrate on it, it becomes almost deafening, especially when it's quiet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>I noticed this thread is becoming filled with speculative answers (even after being unlocked), so I am prematurely submitting this with only a few sources and will be adding more soon. Now updated.</strong></p>
<p>The best answer for this question is simply that the neuroscience of tinnitus is still poorly understood. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073522/" target="_blank">Here is a review from 2010</a> (no paywall) and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v16/n10/full/nrn4003.html" target="_blank">another from 2015</a> that focuses on human neuroimaging (paywall), but both of these reviews say that more research needs to be done. Part of the problem is that tinnitus is very heterogeneous. People can perceive very different types of sounds, and it can affect/distress people in very different ways. This makes tinnitus a difficult thing to study.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer, let's jump in.</p>
<p>The filtering mechanism you're referring to is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation" target="_blank">adaptation</a> and there are versions of it in every sensory system, including hearing. For example, in the presence of loud noise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivocochlear_system" target="_blank">the medial olivocochlear system</a> is a neural circuit that helps to shift the sensitivity of the sensory cells in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea" target="_blank">cochlea</a> to maintain a good dynamic range, i.e. it helps your ability to hear despite the presence of noise. However, there are different types of adaptation that occur at multiple levels in the auditory system, from the most peripheral parts in the cochlea to the most central parts in the cortex. My point here is that just because one type of adaptation exists (like your vision example) does not mean the brain is able to adapt perfectly to <em>any</em> input.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>
<p>In most cases, tinnitus is associated with some type of hearing loss, and usually, the perceived sounds occur near the affected frequency range. The most commonly proposed explanation for these cases is that damage in the cochlea leads to reduced input into the brainstem structures that first process the sound. Here, plastic changes occur in order to compensate for the reduced input. It's thought that these types of changes lead to abnormal activity that are eventually interpreted by higher-level areas as phantom sounds. </p>
<p>But as I said earlier, higher-level areas in the cortex have their own adaptation processes, so you may ask why can't those adaptive processes prevent tinnitus even if the sub-cortical adaptive processes are damaged. It turns out that many non-auditory areas do have abnormalities in people with tinnitus, e.g. parts of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system (this is from the second review I linked). These areas are involved with a wide variety of functions and <em>may</em> be involved in how distressing people find their tinnitus. </p>
<p>In other words, people who are not bothered as much by their tinnitus may have more effective filtering due to adaptive processes in these non-auditory parts of their brain. Conversely, these areas may not be as effective in people with more severe tinnitus. To quote the second review I linked: &quot; ... the sound percept itself could be the result of increased activity in the auditory pathways and permitted or even facilitated by interactions of auditory brain areas with non-auditory brain networks.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 [tl;dr]</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus is a complicated disorder that likely involves many parts of the brain and is still poorly understood. The brain's ability (or inability) to &quot;filter&quot; out tinnitus may be related to how distressing people find their tinnitus. People that are less distressed by their tinnitus may have more effective adaptation processes that involve the interaction of non-auditory and auditory parts of the brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tinnitus could be from a number of causes. Even simple things like aspirin sensitivity can cause it along with electrolyte imbalance, but trauma and acoustic insult to the hair cells in the inner ear are likely the most common causes. Anyway the auditory cortex is wired through the brain stem and not a cortical (cerebral) function. The brain stem does not answer to cortical 'filtering' or adaptation/desensitization. </p>
<p>A good example is nausea you never become used to being nauseous even if it was pervasive. That's because nausea is not a cortical function but rather a brain stem trigger. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tl;dr: The brain doesn’t filter out tinnitus because the brain creates tinnitus. If anything, the brain’s attempt to “filter out silence” (i.e. hear quiet things) might cause tinnitus.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As many have noted, tinnitus is often correlated with hearing loss. Whether it’s age-related or noise induced hearing loss, hair cells in the cochlea aren’t working as well as they once did, thus require louder sound to activate. This also means <strong>the acoustic world of a person with a given level of hearing loss is, on average, quieter than someone without hearing loss.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As u/vir_innominatus noted, the <strong>brain adapts to constant input</strong>. This is probably the most important part. Adaptation occurs for sensory input, but also a LACK of input. This is definitely the case for hearing, for example when people walk into sound attenuated/anechoic rooms they may begin to hear their pulse, their breathing, or experience tinnitus.</p>
</li>
<li>We don’t have a great mechanistic understanding of how tinnitus really works in the brain, but <strong>one hypothesis is that after hearing loss the brain adapts by boosting auditory sensitivity</strong>. With hearing loss, there’s less auditory input into the brain. The brain adapts to this low level of input by turning up the volume, sort of amplifying everything, making auditory neurons more sensitive. This is just another form of neural adaptation, and in general, it’s useful, because if the brain didn’t do this, the effects of even mild hearing loss could be worse. But with this comes the risk of introducing false positives, detecting signals when they aren’t there, i.e. tinnitus. (This is sometimes referred to as the “central gain control” hypothesis of tinnitus, or involving “homeostatic changes” in the central auditory system after hearing loss). This is briefly mentioned here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus#Subjective_tinnitus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus#Subjective_tinnitus</a> , citing <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/38/13452" target="_blank">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/38/13452</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also useful to know that in brains that hear fine and do not have tinnitus, <strong>many auditory neurons fire action potentials even in silence</strong> (this is caused by random movement of hair cell stereocilia). With normal hearing and in a normal acoustic environment, your brain filters out this activity because there are many other things around that are much louder (and cause auditory neurons to fire more action potentials). If the brain detects a dramatically lowered level of input due to hearing loss, its attempt to amplify everything might also amplify this spontaneous activity, which is then perceived as a phantom sound, creating tinnitus.</p>
<p><strong>Most of what I’m talking about is covered in a review by Noreña (2011)</strong> “An integrative model of tinnitus based on central gain controlling neural sensitivity.” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094182" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094182</a> (sorry probably paywalled beyond the abstract)</p>
<p>That being said, u/vir_innominatus emphasized expertly that tinnitus is very heterogeneous and difficult to study. What I’ve said above is mostly from easy to study scenarios, mostly in animal models. There’s just so much we don’t know yet.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, here’s an incomplete list of Google-able neuroscientists trying to figure out the details: Susan Shore, Thanos Tzounopoulos, Arnaud Noreña, J. Eggermont, David McAlpine, whose papers you can find on their webpages, PubMed, or Google Scholar.</p>
