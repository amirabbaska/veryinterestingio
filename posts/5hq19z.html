		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I see the answers below and not something I entirely agree with. There is something called apical dominance. The apical meristem of a plant lies in the buds at the end of the branch. This is where the growth of the branch comes from. This bud sends out auxin throughout the rest of that branch. Auxin inhibits the growth of the rest of the &quot;branch buds&quot; on the branch. While there might be leaves coming from the rest of the branch there is no branch splits or woody parts growing from them. If this bud that is releasing auxin is damaged or gets taken off auxin stops being sent out and all the other buds along the stem will begin to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You raise an interesting question! There are a myriad of factors involved in this process - the singular important factor being, &quot;competition for sunlight.&quot; As you know, trees rely on a process called photosynthesis. In many ways, a tree's biology is designed to optimize its leaves' surface contact with sunlight. In a given land, if trees are located sparsely, you'll notice that they aren't necessarily that tall, but seem to have lots of branches. If you head deeper into forests, you'll notice that the trees are much taller and seldom have branches. It's because branches serve no purpose in such environment; sunlight won't ever reach mid-to-bottom level of the trunk, so it's more effective for trees to grow taller than to branch off. Obviously, it differs based on the species of the tree. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you get a chance you should listen to this podcast. It won't answer your question specifically. But since you're asking a question like this you will definitely find this very very interesting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question seems to apply to my bush pruning situation where I lowered the height of the bush in front of my house and am trying to get it to fill in the bare spots. It seems to be filling in nicely and I have helped it along by bending branches and tying them in appropriate positions with plastic ties. In time the bare branches I bent over sprout buds where the sunlight is exposed to them and in time grew into new branches which is what I need to happen in order to fill in the bare spots because the bush is comprised of several bushes spread out with spaces in between. When they were taller the top filled in nicely but the bottom was thin.  So far the now shorter bush has done well in the last six months filling in both at the top and bottom, but I suspect it will take an entire year to completely fill in. I pruned the bush lower because a local park near by has the same bush and the city pruned them lower because they had the same look mine had and the end result was much improved. So I tried it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
