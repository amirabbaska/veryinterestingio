		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3G and 4G phones can handle more than one download stream for faster speed.</p>
<p>Although LTE is faster than 3G, network carriers are allocating more network bandwidth and capacity to LTE.</p>
<p>As LTE is allocated more bandwidth to service more 4G phones, that takes away 3G network capacity. So where you might have had two download streams on 3G five years ago, the network bandwidth for that extra download stream is now running on 4G LTE.</p>
<p>Here's an article covering the disappearing 2G and reduction of 3G: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/345123/fastest-mobile-networks-2016/4" target="_blank">https://www.pcmag.com/article/345123/fastest-mobile-networks-2016/4</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one has explained this like any 5 year old could understand:</p>
<p>Carriers (phone service providers like AT&amp;T, VZ, etc.) have certain amounts of radio frequencies (think highways for cars ) that they can put all their phone users (drivers) on. They paid the FCC (or whichever national governing body) a ton of $$ for the highways. Billions. Some are wider and can fit more cars at once at faster speeds. Some are narrower and can still go fast, but with lest cars. Some go really long distances but slower speeds. Some really short distances lighting fast. You get the idea. </p>
<p>The reason 3G sucks now is three fold. </p>
<p>1). Had all networks remained the same, phones today require more data (more cars) for the same perceived information (think 1080p streaming, sending 12+ MP pictures, higher screen resolutions). Previously, phones were lower quality and data was less intensive. So that in itself would lead to a slight slow-down (maybe 10-15%). </p>
<p>2). The introduction of LTE required a new way in which data is sent / received (think higher speed limits which require robot-like precision of lane-mergers) so the networks themselves had to add bulk on the backend to support LTE on top of 3G. This back-end complexity itself creates network congestion (again, another 5-10%). </p>
<p>And now the big one combined with the previous two  </p>
<p>3). Radio frequencies were reallocated (highways opened, and some shut down/moved). The carriers took old frequencies (10 lane super highways) that were dedicated to 3G and repurposed them for LTE, leaving 3G on the two lane country roads (metaphorically and physically, ironically). So when LTE super-highways are in gridlock and you have to bump down to 3G, it’s like a winding backroad that you’re stuck on. Yea you move...but at 40mph max and it’s a longer route. </p>
<p>TL;DR: 3G used to be the super-highways of carriers’ networks, but that connection type has been shoved off in favor of LTE and now it’s like driving a country road. Even if no one is on it, you’re slow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What /u/mmmmmmBacon12345 is saying is partially true, in theory. A large extent of it is that carriers have repurposed segments of their 3G spectrum to serve the 4G demand. 5G will be a little different, when it comes, because its frequencies are wildly different to support the insane amount of bandwidth it pushes. In the future, expect 5G to serve larger data needs, 4G to serve basic consumer needs [of course will probably be marketed under a different name, but same basic technology].

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most 3G towers were converted to LTE as most phones support the tech and everyone wants &quot;the fastest&quot; connection. The remaining 2G towers are converted to look like 3G service, but aren't so great.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Simultaneously, cell phones use the internet more and more. Every program that requires communication with a server (which is most everything) eats your bandwidth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Furthermore, wireless devices have become more common. As such, the towers have to handle more connections, handoffs, signal collisions, and frequency issues. In areas with dense population clusters, it is easier to put up more cell sites.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Finally, unless cell providers upgrade to true 4G (100Mbps throughput), they are perfectly fine will selling service and claiming that it is &quot;fastest in the nation&quot; or &quot;most reliable&quot; or &quot;largest coverage&quot;. Most cell providers share each other's towers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
