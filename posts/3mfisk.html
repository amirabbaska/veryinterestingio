		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with where the smell is coming from. Cigarette smoke is smoke. It's combustion particles, actual tiny bits of ash, semi burned tobacco, plant matter, etc, and because it's particulates it is like dust that settles over a room, getting in the fibers of curtains, between pages of books. On top of that a lot of it is tar and other substances which are aeresolized by the smoker, but which become a sticky substance when it cools on a surface, yellowing walls and allowing even more dust, ash, and smoke to stick to it. </p>
<p>Contrast this with parfume literally translated it means through smoke coincidentally as in incense. Parfume isn't made of particles of ash and soot, it's made of volatile oils and extracts like rose oil, bergamot oil, which smell great and have a strong odor, but they don't last very long precisely because they smell so good (strong). The more volatile the compound, the quicker it breaks down (and is released into the air) and the more scent is released in a short period of time. In perfuming this is called the head note and it's what you smell when you first spray a fragrance. The smells are intense but fade quickly. </p>
<p>Then you have heavier oils like patchouli, oak moss, etc which are more stable (less volatile), last longer, but because they are stable, they smell less intense. These are the heart notes, and what you smell an hour after putting on the parfume. </p>
<p>Lastly you have the really thick, resinous components, the real gunky stuff that lasts forever but is much more subtle in scent because it doesn't break down easily. These are your ambergris, amber, tonka bean, etc. These are called the base notes. </p>
<p>So because parfume gets it's scent from oils, esthers, volatile organic compounds, aldehydes, alcohols, etc, these things all have short life spans and strong smells in common. Eventually the oils break down into simpler and simpler components until there is little to no smell left. <strong>edit</strong> Light and heat break down many organic molecules. For instance photographs and print outs left in sunlight might fade because the light destroys the bonds that make up the color. The same thing happens to scents and other molecules. They break down into simpler components. How long this takes depends on the complexity, weight, and stability of the molecule. Generally speaking, the lighter and fragrant molecules are the first to go, and the heavier and resinous or waxy molecules last longer<strong>edit done</strong></p>
<p>You also have to realize that when you put parfume on your body, your body heat helps heat these oils and if you're hot, you get a stronger scent that doesn't last as long. This is why some fragrances are said to be summer ones, and some are winter. </p>
<p>Now back to the comparison with cigarette smoke; a popular mens cologne fragrance is actually tobacco coincidentally, yet if you put on tobacco and leather cologne like Dunhill for Men, it won't make your nose wrinkle days later like a cigar infused tshirt will. Because it's still just tobacco oil, not smoke and combustion particles. </p>
<p>Vaping is largely replacing smoking these days and an interesting thing about vaping is that it also doesn't have combustion particles. The polypropelene glycol, vegetable glycerine, and nicotine are all volatile and break down into smaller molecules and eventually air and water. And the flavorings in vape juice have a lot in common with the oils in fragrances, except they are selected for their flavor, not their odor. </p>
<p>In a nutshell vaping heavily can leave a residue on everything in a room just like smoking, but weeks later it will have broken down into air and water, leaving no lasting damage. Where as a cigarette smoked often enough will discolor walls, and make everything in a room stink. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the reddit gold kind stranger! </p>
<p>There seems to be some confusion over what I meant by volatility. We call them volatile organics and we might also describe how quickly the scent gets into the air as volatility.</p>
<p>The original question had to do with why does one scent linger in the air days or years later so I had to add that the lighter and more delicate molecules will break down faster over time, compared to the heavier more resinous ones like tars, waxes, resins, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh my something I can really talk about!!</p>
<p>There are a couple different explanations that touch on parts of he answer, but of course it's a combination.</p>
<p>The biggest reason some smells stick around is the volatility of the aroma chemical. It's why fine fragrances have &quot;top notes&quot; and &quot;base notes&quot; as others have mentioned. Some materials will evaporate extremely slowly; I work with materials that I can dip a blotter into and that small blotter will still smell a month later.</p>
<p>One thing to really keep in mind about smells is that all of them smell due to volatile chemicals. If a chemical Was not volatile in some way there would be no way to smell it. It's just the degree of volatility that determines how long they last in an area. </p>
<p>So why does cigarette smoke stick around forever? As others have pointed out the products of cigarette smoke produce tars, resins, dust, etc that evaporate very slowly. In addition to this smoking is usually a routine so the same area is getting consistently covered in smoke odor faster than the smoke odor is leaving the seats of your couch. This isn't unique to smoke though. Go to any restaurant and they tend to have a unique odor to them. Especially bakeries. The odor keeps building because the aromatic materials produced from baking cakes get layered on the walls. </p>
<p>TL;DR aromas evaporate at different rates. Some fast, some slow, and some extremely slow. If you keep adding smells to an area faster than it evaporates the odor builds and will stick around for a long long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There used to be an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in my town, and about two years ago it was gutted and replaced by a new retail store. Even after the walls were torn down, you could pass by and it reeked of the Abercrombie perfume that they pumped into that place. I mentioned it out loud to my wife and a construction worker overheard.. He said it was a nightmare and they couldn't get the smell out. </p>
<p>I guess this is to say, use enough of anything and the smell will stick around. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally and in the simplest way possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perfumes and other fragrances that don't linger contain small molecules that are very volatile and evaporate quickly. They have a very low boiling point and high vapor pressure. This is why these kinds of fragrances &quot;blow away&quot; quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>The fragrances that make up cigarette smoke contain small molecules are are slightly larger, are not as volatile, and evaporate more slowly. On top of that, the smoke contains particles which trap these molecules, giving off a &quot;bleed off&quot; effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall it comes down to the molecules that comprise the fragrances. Smaller molecules such as simple alkanes, simple aldehydes, and simple acids are found in perfumes, candle fragrances, foods, etc... Larger molecules such as fatty acids, long chain aldehydes, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are commonly found in lingering scents such as cigarette smoke or body odor.</p>
<p>For reference, I am an analytical chemist with a background in small molecule analysis using GC/MS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
