		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere everywhere (even outside the cloud) contains lots and lots and lots of water. And under a stable combination of temperature, pressure, and humidity, all that moisture is perfectly happy to exist in a completely gaseous state. But as differing air masses start to collide, the local atmospheric conditions can fall outside the range where water can exist in a completely gaseous state. That is known as the dew point.</p>
<p>A cloud is where two differing atmospheric conditions have met, and the resulting condensed water droplets simply do not have sufficient weight to overcome the updraft speed of the air around it. If the air masses mix slowly, the rate of condensation will occur slowly and over a longer period of time. The resulting clouds may simply &quot;evaporate&quot; as the local conditions stabilize, or the condensing water may slowly precipitate over the ground (soft rain), or the precipitation may never reach the ground at all. These gentler atmospheric changes tend to play out over longer periods of time because the air masses are moving more slowly so it takes longer for the differences to mix and settle down into a new steady state.</p>
<p>If two air masses have widely varying conditions (think warm moist air over the ocean meeting dryer hotter conditions over the land) and they meet more abruptly (higher wind speeds), this causes a more-violent disturbance; the moisture from the air will condense more quickly, the rain falls faster and harder, and the whole thing ends (relatively speaking) more quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely certain what you mean by &quot;soft rain&quot;... if what you mean is precipitation that is of low intensity and uniform over a large area, then it has to do with how the rainfall system is formed.</p>
<p>Rainfall can generally be classified into two types: convective precipitation and stratiform precipitation. Convective precipitation is the intense but localized rainfall with generally large rain drops, whereas stratiform precipitation is weak rainfall, often a &quot;misty&quot; kind of rain, but covering a huge area. Whether you get convective or stratiform precipitation depends on the conditions under which the precipitation is formed.</p>
<p>Convective precipitation is often associated with high degrees of thermodynamic instability. For example, a moist atmosphere with intense surface heating can lead to strong convection that builds up a thunderstorm cell, producing significant rainfall over a small area. Stratiform precipitation tends to come more from &quot;gentle&quot; dynamical factors, such as a large scale pressure system that pushes warm air over cool air, with the rising motion resulting in drizzle. (Interestingly, a large thunderstorm can have both convective and stratiform precipitation, with the convective part falling from the intense core and stratiform part from the trailing anvil where conditions are &quot;gentler&quot;.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot find much nontechnical information about the convective/stratiform distinction of rainfall on the Internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_types" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> gives a rambling description with just a bit of useful information. The American Meteorological Society's glossary provides a clearer but short definition of <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Stratiform_precipitation_area" target="_blank">stratiform rainfall</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding its the difference in weight distribution. A soft rain is droplets that are small and take the shape of a pancake due to the smaller volume &amp; weight being smushed by competing air resistance and gravity. A hard rain is when droplets are large and heavy enough to to give gravity the upper hand, thus pulling the mass into a more aerodynamic teardrop shape. So in short (TLDR) its the difference between throwing pancakes and baseballs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
