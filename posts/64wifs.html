		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how many Teraflops (trillion calculations per second) is estimated to be required for that level of realism, but consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>By the previous trend of computing power advancement, we should see GPUs in the 300+ Tflop range by 2027. A GTX 1080 is about 9 Tflops at stock clocks, and 10.5 Tflops with widely achievable overclocks. A Titan Xp is about 14 Tflops, with realistic overclock.</li>
<li>A GTX 580 was about 1.6 Tflops and produced <a href="http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ss/gamefiles/50a6afe1cca73.jpg" target="_blank">graphics like this at high frame rate</a></li>
<li>A GTX 1080 can produce graphics <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SGcbNFJzI6Q/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> or <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PEPICv9g-d0/VX9VwfhhPCI/AAAAAAAASFA/QCzWC42UVs8/s1600/ROTTR6.tif" target="_blank">like this</a> at high frame rate</li>
<li>Do note it's difficult to show a proper comparison between different games, and with compressed screenshots. You can see massive improvements, but there's great improvements in things like realistic faces and animations too.</li>
<li>So we can at least infer that since a ~5.5x increase in processing power from a GTX 580 to GTX 1080 made a massive improvement, a ~30x increase from a GTX 1080 to its equivalent card in 2027 should be extremely substantial.</li>
<li>Game performance has also been limited by inefficiencies in the DX11, and older, graphics APIs. Vulkan and DX12 remove a lot of those inefficiencies, so games could look better even on a current GTX 1080 just by building a game more efficiently.</li>
<li>On the other hand though, we likely need to run games at a minimum resolution of 8K (7680x4320) and framerate of 90 fps in order for our brains to be convinced it's 'real enough'. This is taken from a combination of the resolution the human eye sees in, and the research by many in the VR industry, chiefly Valve, finding that 90 fps is the critical point at which your mind feels 'presence' in VR.</li>
<li>Running something a 8K is 16x harder than running at 1080p (1920x1080), at the same graphics quality and framerate. Though there are potential software 'tricks' and efficiency solutions to bring that 16x down.</li>
<li>Note that if a card ~30x faster than a GTX 1080 is not sufficient, the progress in processing power is multiplicative, so 10 years later (in 2037 now) you'd have a card which was ~900x (30x30) times faster than a GTX 1080. Assuming computing power keeps following its long-term trend. If ~900x the power of a GTX 1080 was not sufficient for completely realistic graphics, I'd be gobsmacked.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Given it looks like a tall order, but we also make relentless progress with processing power, I make the prediction we could see fully realistic graphics at high framerate by 2027-ish. And I'd be 99.99% sure it will happen before 2037.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the more static scenes in recent releases are almost indistinguishable from reality. They do amount to what's practically an architectural render, but it does serve as a proof of concept for what current hardware can handle. </p>
<p>Uncharted 4 is a great example. With some clever lighting and texture mapping,  some of the interior environments look stunningly similar to real life. Strategic / realistic placement of objects in the level design and an attention to imperfections and micro detail also trick us into perceiving a more realistic scene: <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yZz05" target="_blank">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yZz05</a></p>
<p>Other tech demos exist, such as the Unreal Engine 4, Paris Apartment. This sterile environment focuses almost entirely on lighting, texture quality and frame rate to produce a realistic scene. All the shadows are 'baked': <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wHjIoyEeCdo" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wHjIoyEeCdo</a></p>
<p>Of course, the challenge is much greater when rendering a dynamic scene, especially when physics are involved...</p>
<p>EDIT: Do to the fact that this thread has blown up, I think that I'll expand a little bit. Anyone who's in the game industry can feel free to correct me -- this is just a personal interest of mine.</p>
<p>In terms of physics and realism, I see several things that were major leaps forward and contributed to the realism that we see today.</p>
<p>Nvidia PhysX in games such as Mirrors Edge introduced a new generation of rudimentary soft body dynamics and fluid physics: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFio7wMTQ2k" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFio7wMTQ2k</a></p>
<p>Crysis 1, the fan favorite, was impressive for a number of reasons. Firstly, the shear number of resources in the open world added a sense of realism. After all, in real life, we're surrounded by millions of particles, plants, trees, etc. Dynamic water caustics were another impressive feat that was added later in the series, however the water in Crysis 1 was still leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Volumetric lighting created the sun ray effects in the forests, and when you hold your gun in front of the sun. Environmental destruction both included the fun breakable palm trees, but also the completely collapsible huts, filled with physical assets. Texture mapping (parallax) gives the 3d effect that gravel, rocks and dirt have, instead of sharp polygons overlaid with stretched, 2d textures. Impressive texture quality, particle effects, shading and a number of 'fun' additions such as the water which remains on the screen after swimming, also contributed to the realism in Crysis 1. Here are just some of the effects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2RRkCaTgZM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2RRkCaTgZM</a></p>
<p>Driveclub gives us a perfect example of how small details (the organic / natural way the water moves on the window) and scene atmosphere (lighting differential between the car and the environment, among other things) can contribute to our sense of realism: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hViwrRGfuHU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hViwrRGfuHU</a></p>
<p>Advanced geometry, high texture resolution and subsurface scattering in Star Wars Battlefront: <a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/euclideon-explained/endor.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/euclideon-explained/endor.jpg</a> </p>

<p>...and Skyrim mods which avoid repeating the same grass textures over and over again:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to add that aside from GPU restrictions, there's the aspect of CREATING the assets used in game (models, environments, textures, dynamic and particle simulations, realistic animation movements etc). In general, the more detailed and realistic these become, to some degree, the more man-hours are required at an exponential rate. Despite being considered simply &quot;computer generated&quot; by most of the population, it requires an incredible amount of human input and creation and an ungodly amount of finessing and detail work.</p>
<p>Hence while I see it very possible to have the technology to render very realistic games before long, I believe the true limiting factor will be the ability to produce realistic content to PUT into those render engines.</p>
<p>Just my opinion. I'm a visual effects artist and professional 3d modeller.</p>
<p>edit: wow thank you to whoever gave me gold, my first ever!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people talking about tech requirements when the real issue isn't pure graphical capabilities but an issue of the uncanny valley. The uncanny valley is the idea that the closer you get to truly emulating humanity the more we notice the differences, not necessarily specifics of what is wrong but you can tell something is off and get a distinct creepy feeling from it.</p>
<p>The uncanny valley is primarily an issue of movement and animation not of actual graphical capabilities, so you could 3D model/paint a still scene that looks identical (and it could probably be argued that we already have) but when things move, they simply don't look quite right.</p>
<p>People have tried to fix this by using motion capture which has been very successful for full body movements but the face is where we do just about all of our human recognition. Games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2YitSqkvJo" target="_blank">LA Noire</a> and more recently <a href="https://youtu.be/kMaxrryH0es?t=223" target="_blank">trailers for Death Stranding</a> put a huge amount of work into facial motion capture but no matter what you do eventually people will see the differences because there is only so much motion capture you can physically do. Did you record someones face moving idly for 10 hours? well some dedicated gamers have played your game for 800 hours and have seen every single facial expression he made in that 10 hours and know exactly when it loops. Did you record someone running? well your fanbase has noticed that they start their stride in one of 18 ways every time. keeping with animation issues, are you going to motion capture grass? how many unique animations are you going to have for each patch of grass moving? how many before someone staring at your grass notices the loop?</p>
<p>since you've specified video games you have the problem of players doing whatever the hell they want and your most important goal is to stop everything from glitching out when that happens, and players will always try to do things that are not physically possible for a normal person (ever made a character repeatedly spin on their axis? people in real life can't do that)</p>
<p>So to answer your question, i'd honestly say they will never be good enough to truly never see the difference. I don't see there ever being a point where creating a true perfect visual copy of our world will be doable, much less economically viable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're pushing 80 years old, expect to see within your lifetime a level of graphics that meets at LEAST the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Indistinguishable from 4k video of a real scene, depicting pretty much whatever actors and scenery that the game calls for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable of simulating smoke, fire, water, and other fluid-based phenomena, once again to at least 4k resolution on a screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable of producing fully artificially generated sounds, incuding speech, in real time (I realize this is not really a &quot;graphics&quot; thing, but it's relevant to the whole experience).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 4k-resoluion virtual reality goggles, with wide peripheral field of view, allowing all of the above to be displayed for VR. Note that we have 1080p virtual reality goggles now, and the head-tracking issue is basically solved.</p>
</li>
<li>Some level of glove or whole-body-suit physical-presence controller technology, allowing the body to interact with the virtual world. This may or may not be capable of simulating physical sensations of touch or impact, for the user.</li>
