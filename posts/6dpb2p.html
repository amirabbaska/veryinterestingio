		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's to keep the weight legal when they are heavy.</p>
<p>But why not just keep them down all the time?  Well, in addition to saving wheel wear, (truck tires are expensive) they also save on tolls.  Many tolls are based on how many axles you have, and an additional axle shoots the toll up substantially.  If you can raise that axle, you now have significantly cheaper tolls.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are called drop axles. They are raised when not needed, so as to save on tire wear. When the truck is loaded, they can be dropped down to relieve weight from (usually) the front axle to avoid getting an overweight ticket. The weird ones are the ones that have 4 drop axles. They look like caterpillars to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I run Michigan with a six axle fuel trailer. The first and last axle are self steering. Self steering axles are required by law in Ontario . The second axle on the trailer we call a Michigan lift axle. We are required to have it down when loaded in the state of Michigan, but if we cross into Ontario we have to lift it because it's not required under their weight restrictions. The combination allows us to run in excess of 120,000 pounds of loaded weight. And as has been said, but we're not loaded we only have three axles on the ground and three of them are lifted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other reasons that tag axles/drop axles are raised: when they are down, not only are they wearing the tires, but they also make manoeuvring much more difficult; they drag in the corners, making it harder to do tight turns, driving down fuel economy, and raising sideways stress on the frame. </p>
<p>In some regions, they have been made illegal precisely because they reduce manoeuvrability; in my Canadian province of Manitoba, they were outlawed back in the '90s. You still see them on a few older farm trucks that have either been grandfathered in, or just haven't been caught yet due to lax rural enforcement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
