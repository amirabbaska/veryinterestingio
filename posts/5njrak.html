There is some speculation in the ALS community that his condition is actually mislabeled. In other words, he actually doesn't have ALS, but rather something different and undiagnosed. </p>
<p>I'm no expert on ALS, and again, this is only speculation. It is, however, an interesting perspective coming directly from the people who've directly experienced the disease. It seems to be discussed often among members of the ALS community.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experts aren't really sure, but what happens with ALS is that the neurons that control your movements begin to weaken, and thus you gradually lose the ability to control your muscles.  Typically someone with ALS succumbs to the disease when they lose the ability to breathe or swallow.<br />
In Hawking's case, he has retained the ability to breathe and drink... and with some very attentive care to make sure he doesn't get bedsores from his immobility, this is what has kept him alive.<br />
I'm sure that [retaining the ability to communicate] (<a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html" target="_blank">http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html</a>) helps his prognosis from a mental health standpoint, as he controls his speech computer by moving a muscle in his cheek.  To me that is more fascinating than his ability to fight the onset of his ALS.  If that muscle movement were to go... it would be a sad day for all of mankind, as his contributions to the world of physics are nothing short of remarkable.</p>
