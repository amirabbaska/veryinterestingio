		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matching is just putting things together without clashing colors or patterns. Now the harder part- what clashes and doesn't . Starting with colors, generally things on opposite sides of the color wheel-  (just search it) will go well together. Those next to each other on the color will as well. Those in some other position may not. You shouldn't put the same color on all the clothes because then it's just too much of one hue.  As for patterns, usually only either the top or the bottom can have them as an easy way to stay out of trouble.  </p>
<p>(There is a lot more like accessories which can add third color to make it more interesting but you are just trying to survive here not become a fashion designer)</p>
<p>Now for the easiest way: just use opposites.
Well if you start with the bottoms, let's assume no pattern just color. The easiest is black or white because nearly everything will match with it as a top. So black pants, white top. White pants, black top. If something has to have a pattern- choose only the top or bottom and the other is a plain color.</p>
<p>Oh and tell your gf - pick your own damn clothes out next time too</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>color theory (which colors go together well, you can research this online).</li>
<li>patterns (dont have different patterns together, for example, dont have plaid with stripes)</li>
<li>type of clothing (for example dont have alllll denim in one outfit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Im sure theres more points but i cant think of more at this moment </p>
<p>Edit- sometimes she will like to change up her outfit, if you picked out what she wore last week she will feel as though other people will think she is lazy and wears the same outfit like a cartoon character</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First the relationship advice:</p>
<p>There's no way she's going to agree to anything you pick so I'm not sure why she's even asking you except to make you wrong about something.</p>
<p>Next time she says that, point at your favorite panty/bra set and leave it at that. :)</p>
<p>Flashman's fashion advice is spot on.  Realize that aside of the rules he mentions, there are cultural elements too.  Suit and sneakers doesn't necessarily look stupid from a purely aesthetic standpoint but the formal/casual contrast is dissonant.</p>
<p>I often recommend &quot;Dress for Success&quot;.  Aside from a lot of good (if dated) fashion advice, the book explores why people judge clothing the way they do (in a nutshell, &quot;nice&quot; clothes are ones that make you look wealthy and like a good choice as a mate).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little late to the discussion, but check out <a href="https://i0.wp.com/blog.asmartbear.com/wp-content/uploads/art-factory-color-wheel.jpeg" target="_blank">this color wheel</a></p>
<p>The primary colors will &quot;match&quot; with the secondary or tertiary colors that touch it. </p>
<p>The colors across the wheel from each other will &quot;pop.&quot; Wearing yellow and purple (across) will make both colors stand out more. And yellow really doesn't need to stand out any more than it already does. But this is why redheads look so striking in green clothes. It makes their hair look super red. </p>
<p>Clothes that match are always a safe bet. Wearing clothes that pop can be great, or it can be jarring. I would probably stay away from popping yellow or red. They're already very loud colors. Buuut, a pair of bright red socks under blue slacks can deliver just a pinch of &quot;bold, and also daring.&quot;</p>
<p>Also... this is why you see <strong>SOO MANY</strong> movie posters saturated in orange and blue. They are across, so they pop really well, which draws your eye to the poster, without being obnoxiously loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think of matching clothes like the card game Set. Within each dimension, you want your items to be all the same or all different. Styles should be all the same or quite different. Colors should either be exactly the same or rather different. Go all the same and you'll look very matching, but rather uninteresting (just buy all black everything and you'll always look pretty good). Go all different and you'll look a bit crazy (generally don't use more than 2 strong colors). So find your spot in between. Generally, I try to go mostly the same, and diversify in one area, like a colorful shirt or jacket over commonplace pants and other items. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
