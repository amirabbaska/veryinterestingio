<p>Alright. Poop talk. Here we go.</p>
<p>Most animals are vegetarian. Lots of fiber. Often their poop forms fecal balls that gently cascade out of the animals anus like some kind of zen pebble garden fountain. Occasionally they get sick, have diarrhea, etc. That stuff stains their fur and irritates their butt. No fun. </p>
<p>Some of us are carnivores. Carnivore poop is many magnitudes grosser than vegetarian poop. That's why you can skitter across a field full of little goat raisinettes with little to no effect, but your cat can clear the room dropping a single turd. Carnivores can make up for some of the lack of roughage by eating the fur and sinew of its prey as well as ingestion of its own fur through grooming. This helps give the poops form as a protein rich diet tends to less like string cheese and more like go-gurt.  </p>
<p>We are omniverous, eating whatever tripe the food lobby puts in front of us. Some of us are better about eating roughage, vegetables, etc than others. But often we eat high protein, high carbohydrate diets which means that a lot of people are experiencing the Jackson Pollock shits.</p>
<p>The last element of the deuce equation is that we're bipedal with well developed gluteal muscles that encroach on the anal playing field. It's like trying to play field hockey in a back alley. You can do it, but you're gonna hit the walls a lot. Quadripeds have a different muscle orientation where their muscle mass is to the side rather than directly behind. We can bypass this anatomic hurdle by doing the deep squat. This brings the gluteals to the lateral and clears the airfield for the bombs to drop. But when you sit on the toilet like a nut on a Hershey bar, looking up cat videos on your phone, your butt cheeks are squeezed together and you can't help but to paint the walls. Furthermore, the commercial block is almost over so you're trying to eject that turd with magnum cannon force all the while reflexively clenching your puckerino, something akin to putting your thumb over the head of the hose and spraying your sister when she's trying to look cool sunbathing with her friends.</p>
<p>So if you're getting a flair in your <del>darier</del> derrière (thank you /u/Lee_Troyer), eat your veggies, cop a proper squat and relax the cracks. It'll save you the trouble of having to give yourself a tongue bath.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow. This got a response for something casually typed out while I was feeding my daughter dairy products. Thank you all for your kind words and for those of you who gelded me, why would you do that? I needed those. But seriously, thank you.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Word to the wise - if you know as much about shit as I do, you're either a proctologist or a veterinarian and I don't do people. So yes, I know the difference between gilding and gelding. Just a little veterinarian humor. Typically my time spent on reddit is making jokes to myself deemed too subtle to be funny (case in point). Guess I get it right every once in a while though.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: For those who are emphatically pointing out, sometimes with troubling enthusiasm, that many mammals prolapse their anus, I will just say that there are few cases where legitimate prolapse is not a disease state. Some critters have an increased laxity in the connective tissue stabilizing their rectums but at most I would say that this allows for protrusion, not true prolapse. If somebody has a source on physiologic prolapse, I'd be more than interested to give it a look. As for us, if you're constipated, eat a poor diet, don't drink enough water AND are in a hurry to get off the throne, then you too can experience the joys of rectal prolapse. But you might also pull an Elvis so I wouldn't recommend it.</p>
<p>As for cows, yes, they have the tendencies to undercook their pies leaving them shloppy half-baked piles. As an aside, baked the rest of the way in the sun, they can act as a worthwhile stand in for a frisbee if you're in a pinch. The upper digestive tract of a cow holds A LOT of water - upwards of 50 gallons or so. The moisture is both a robust ecosystem for the little buggies that break down the fibrous plant material they eat as well as a mechanical means of softening and breaking apart plant material. The result is that while they have other parts of their forestomach that specialize in retaining that water, a lot of it gets mixed with the end product and it keeps their cow bombs on the soft-serve side of the equation. That doesn't even take into account the fact that the housing conditions of cattle are akin to a daycare and that diarrhea from intestinal pathogens is a frequent occurrence. </p>
<p>FINAL EDIT: What started with me feeding my kid before my first cup of coffee is ending with me feeding my kid. I'm signing off for the night, but sincerely thanks to all of you. I've gotten a lot of seemingly heartfelt compliments today, something I can really use right now, and it's been a profound joy knowing that I was able to give the bulk of you a chuckle or 2 while you were finishing up your number 2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s at least partly because humans should be squatting to defecate rather than sitting. It makes less mess, and it’s good for the pelvic floor! Most humans also aren’t eating a healthy diet with a good balance of fiber. Healthy feces also makes less mess. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
