		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well if you have a really large military, thats a pretty big deterrent for anyone to go to war against you. You have a huge military, ready to go and kick some ass.</p>
<p>If you have a large military and someone else doesn't if you choose to go to war, you can smash them. You're ready to go, you can get in tons and tons of sucker punches, if not a knockout, before the other side can even get into the game.</p>
<p>So two things: Having a large military is as much about NOT going to war as it is about the potential to win one if it ever does happen, both outcomes are good.</p>
<p>to further add on, since at least the late 1800s &quot;mobilization&quot; was one of the most important aspect of a military.  That is the first country to be able to get their military together, ready, and in the action, has a decisive advantage.  Spending large amounts of money and having a large ready to go military provides that. This was a huge lesson of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" target="_blank">Franco-Prussian War</a>, and WWI, and after how effective and mandatory military planners saw it in those conflicts, the thought of not being very very ready is just wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because otherwise if and when you do go to war, it would take months to mobilize troops. Even with a draft, you need to provide basic train and equipment to your troops. If you don't have it already, it has to be done, which takes time. Additionally, if you don't maintain dedicated manufacturing facilities for war equipment, you have to spend time creating them and/or converting civilian factories to that purpose. It took many months after the declaration of war in WWI and WWII for the US to be fully ready for combat. Where as for the Korean war, the US was able to respond much more quickly to the North's invasion.</p>
<p>On top of that, billions today isn't even that much relative to the size of global economies. Granted the US spends more per GDP than most Western countries, but it's nominal spending only seems wildly inflated because its economy is so much larger than other countries who dedicated more of their economy to military spending.</p>
<p>Additionally, have a strong military deters aggressors from engaging in war with you and your allies in the first place. The Cold War was filled with proxy wars in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, instead of in North America and Europe because NATO and the USSR maintained large militaries and nuclear stock piles to deter such conflicts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's sort of like asking why houses and buildings that aren't being broken into have locks on the doors, or even alarm systems and security guards.</p>
<p>Crimea used to be part of Ukraine as recently as 2014, and now it's not.  They couldn't defend their territory, and now it's not their territory anymore.  </p>
<p>Edit: someone wants &quot;nuance.&quot;  Here: Ukraine gave up nukes hosted in their terrority in exchange for secure borders.  You see how that worked out for them.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A country can't just &quot;buy&quot; a military, it's something that takes decades to build.  Experienced soldiers are not easy to come by, commanders even less so.  A good battlefield commander might take 2 decades of experience before they are competent so it's not like you can just hire one off the street. </p>
<p>Military tech is unique.  Procurement is often complex and maintenance requires special training.  The equipment is often cutting edge and needs to be developed so can't just be purchased as is.  It's the kind of stuff that needs to be developed and built specifically for your country. </p>
<p>So you can't just decide one day that you want to buy some fighter jets.  Sometimes you might be able to buy them from a friendly country that has already done the development, but if everyone follows the &quot;spend only during times of war&quot; methods then that option won't exist. </p>
<p>In addition, most modern militaries are not only used in war but also have significant peacetime responsibilities.  The main responsibility of the western militaries is maintaining international commerce abilities, particularly shipping.  In today's modern word of globalization, why do you think we don't have a HUGE piracy problem.  Sure there are pockets of problems but it's not like container ships are getting jacked left and right. It's because the Navy's of the world shut that shit down and fast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
