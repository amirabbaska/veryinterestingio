		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're generally not poisonous to all animals.  The animals they &quot;want&quot; to eat them can eat them safely.  For example, while it's not technically a poison, the chemicals in chile peppers that make them burn only affect mammals.  Birds can safely eat them and birds tend to fly &amp; travel longer distances, allowing the plant to spread further.</p>
<p>In other cases, the plant might not <em>always</em> be poisonous.  They might only be poisonous (or taste horrible) before they're ripe.  This prevents them from being eaten before the seeds are ready to germinate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some fruits that are poisonous to us are not to local wildlife. Some birds and animals have ways to cope with the toxicity of different fruits which allows them to still be spread. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants &quot;want&quot; to entice the best carrier/distributor for their fruit. An animal that is able to eat the fruit but can't digest the seeds. Which sometimes gets a bit too specific, as with avocado where now humans do the job of extinct giant sloths. </p>
<p>Not all fruit <em>need</em> to be eaten. Some only become able to sprout after cycling through an animal, others aren't that picky and only use animals for transport. Tomato seeds sprout great when the fruit rotted around them. Strawberries mostly procreate with runners, the berries aren't all that important once a plant took hold but if ants spread seeds a bit further, it's faster than growing runners that far. </p>
<p>Blackthorn fruit are gross until the first frost. They don't have much flesh to offer but because the plant is timed to ripen when there's barely anything else to eat, it gets away with low-effort fruit that still get reliably transported.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how humans love to eat grapes but grapes are really poisonous to dogs? Well all fruits are like that, tasty to some species but poisonous to others.</p>
<p>It’s because a plant wants to make its fruit really appealing to whatever species will spread the seeds but doesn’t want other species to eat it, so it makes it off putting to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth is a place full of things that do not concern us. </p>
<p>Evolution and the biology of animals and plants are not all going to be oriented and centered around us and our species. We are not the pinnacle of evolution, we are merely another step in a never ending chain. </p>
<p>The world will continually do and produce strange, unusual, wonderful, terrible, beautiful and disgusting things because it always has and always will. It does not do things in malevolent or benevolent ways for or against us because it does not even see us as important. It is only us who think we are important. </p>
<p>So the world will always be full of things that are great and fantastic for us but also things that are dangerous and poisonous because they are all there for some other purpose that does not concern us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
