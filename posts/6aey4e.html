		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;bait car&quot; is indistinguishable from a regular car as far as any passer-by can determine. So it doesn't entice or deter any more or less than any other car. It just happens to be being watched and may have a trap. This is &quot;fair game&quot; in every sense.</p>
<p>If the cop handed someone some keys and said go get that car for me, strongly implying that the car belonged to them and that they were authorizing its retrieval, then &quot;sprung the trap&quot; then they've done more than set out bait... they've shoved someone into the trap under pretense of permission.</p>
<p>Same as well if the car had a sign on its roof that said &quot;Free Car&quot; or &quot;Ride-share Experiment, drive me&quot;.</p>
<p>Same as well if the cop shoved the person into the car from off-camera and then locked the doors.</p>
<p>Crime is about motive.</p>
<p>If the bait doesn't induce, if it doesn't provide motive beyond innocent circumstance, then it's fine.</p>
<p>Something that spurs motive or acts as coercion or inducement is unfair for inserting motive that wasn't there before.</p>
<p>Similarly if you steal a car because it's your only means of escaping a pursuing axe-murderer then it stops being a real theft because the motive wasn't to deprive someone of their property, it was an exigent attempt to escape immanent threat.</p>
<p>Now if you steal my car and lock me out and drive off while we are <em>both</em> fleeing the axe murderer then things get complicated. Did you know I was there? Did you have reason to believe I'd already been axed? Did you throw me under the bus as bait? Did I say &quot;go on without me!&quot; or did someone else say that and you thought it was me? Were you &quot;no longer in your right mind&quot; because of fear or blood loss (maybe you got lightly axed earlier)? Did you have reason to believe that I'm the axe murderer or that I was working in league with him?</p>
<p>Which is why we have trials where facts and circumstances and motives and such must be weighed.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the much more egregious problem of plea bargaining, which replaces the measure of facts, circumstances, and motives with a game of chicken between an individual and the entire weight of government prosecution.</p>
<p>But that's a completely different and more important question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The police are not allowed to &quot;bait&quot; people into committing crimes they would not otherwise perform, such as through coercion. They <em>can</em> set traps for people who are trying to commit crimes of their own accord.</p>
<p>For example a plainclothes police officer standing on the corner apparently selling drugs isn't going to make anyone purchase drugs if they weren't going to buy them from a legitimate criminal. A bait car sitting on the side of the road isn't any more likely to be stolen by someone who doesn't normally steal cars.</p>
<p>The key point here is that the police are not making people commit those crimes when otherwise they wouldn't have, they are just influencing them to commit the crime where the police can catch them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw an episode of cops where they did a bait car setup with a bicycle.  Apparently there were a lot of bikes being stolen in the area.  The thing that threw me off was, instead of using a typical bike (under the$1000 minimum for felony theft), they used some crazy custom bike that costs thousands of dollars.  So instead of these guys getting Petty theft charges, they all got hauled off to jail for Grand larceny with felony charges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>bait cars</strong></p>
<p>You've pointed out how poorly worded the phrase &quot;bait car&quot; is. The police identify areas with high car theft rates and the types of cars the thieves target. Then they place cars based on this profile, and wait until a thief breaks into it. They are indistinguishable from just a regular car in the neighborhood. </p>
<p>It's really more of a &quot;trap car&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entrapment means that they offered a crime to someone, which is inadmissible in a court of law. It is unfair because someone might not have committed a crime if it were not for the offer. If a cop walks up to someone and say, &quot;would you like to buy drugs&quot;, the person may not be a criminal, not looking for drugs, and might be intimidated by the offer and pay the money to not get harrassed by what he believes is a drug dealer. Same like if a cop comes up to someone and says, &quot;Lets go steal a car&quot;, the other person will be going along with the crime that was offered to them.</p>
<p>Bait on the other hand catches people who are looking to commit a crime. A female police officer dresses up like a hot chick and stands on the corner with known prostitutes. She is not offering sex for money, just dressed like everyone else and standing around.   When a person approaches her and offers money for sex, that person is actively seeking a prostitute, not being coerced into it. </p>
<p>A car parked on the side of the road is just that, a car on the side of the road. Whether police put it there, or the average citizen, it is still ultimately just a car sitting there. If someone comes by and tries to steal it, then the intent is on the person stealing the car.</p>
<p>If a cop dresses up like a stoner and hangs out, he is not offering anybody drugs, he is not enticing anyone, he is just dressed a certain way in a certain place. When someone tries to buy weed off him, they are committing a crime by trying to purchase drugs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
