Its curvature, which does exist as we do live on a sphere (as you pointed out) isn’t significant enough to matter in any manner of practical application.</p>
<p>So technically it isn’t but it isn’t significant until you are on a pretty massive scale</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Level relative to the surface of a sphere works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start at the center of the sphere.</li>
<li>Draw a ray from the center of the sphere to a point on the surface of the water.</li>
<li>Measure the distance.</li>
<li>Repeat for all points on the surface of the water.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the distance is the same each time, it's level.</p>
<p>Water <a href="http://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/news_detail/public/tsunami%20750x500.jpg?itok=KdbOJEV-" target="_blank">isn't always level</a>. Even ignoring waves, the depth of an ocean at a particular place varies due to the tides -- the moon and sun pull at the water, and that's a strong enough force to change the depth by a nontrivial degree.</p>
<p>A useful concept here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_repose" target="_blank">angle of repose</a>. The idea is: if you pour a pile of this thing, how steep are the sides of this pile? For gravel, it's like 45°. For snow, it's more like 38°. And wet, sloppy clay is only 15°.</p>
<p>Liquid water's angle of repose is 0°.</p>
<p>That doesn't tell you why, though.</p>
<p>The biggest aspect of the angle of repose is how easily particles move past each other. Boulders don't easily move past each other, so you can assemble them into a wall. Dry sand bits can move past each other a lot better, so they have a much shallower angle of repose. And water molecules can move past each other very easily, so they have a 0° angle of repose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing level with flat.  &quot;Level&quot; in this context means that all points on the surface have the same gravitational potential.  It does not mean that the surface is flat.  However the difference is so slight at human scales near the Earth's surface that we don't usually distinguish.  If you're making something really big (like a runway), you definitely have to decide between flat or level.</p>
<p>Water self levels because nature prefers the lowest energy state.  If you release a drop of water in the air, it will fall to the ground.  If you hold up a string with just the tip touching the ground, it will fall and pool on the ground.  A mass of water has no intrinsic shape (one definition of fluid is that any mass of fluid takes the shape of its container) so the top surface will &quot;fall&quot; into the lowest energy state where no part of the surface is higher than any other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the first part of your question: the weight of the water increases the pressure at the bottom.  Water flows from high pressure to low, so it will flow away from areas where the water is thicker, until the level is even everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is almost never level but not for the reasons you seem to be thinking.  Also a lot of people in this thread seem to have some problems with the difference between flat and level.<br />
A drywall is flat but it is not level, it usually approximates vertical at right angles to level.<br />
A good pool table is (relatively) both flat and level.<br />
Mean sea level is level but is by no means flat.<br />
Mean sea level is a mathematical construct that is the average position of the sea if you remove the effects of things like wind and waves.<br />
It is a surface that represents the position of the sea surface due to the effects of gravitational potential.<br />
If you have a good sized lake with similar type of terrain and rocks around and no wind or anything to disturb the water the surface will approximate a portion of a sphere.  This lake is level but curved, only slightly curved but curved none the less.
Imagine a similar lake with a large mountain at one end and a flat sandy plain at the other.  The mountain will add a very small extra gravitational pull in its direction and lift the water slightly at one end because the gravity effect will diminish over distance.  This lake will be level but curved not only by the general gravity of the earth  but by the more specific gravity of the nearby mountain.<br />
The lakes are considered to be level because at any point on their surface the water surface is a right angles to the force of gravity at that point.<br />
Generally an ocean, sea or lake is not level due to effects of wind, waves, water density etc etc but if you take a lot of measurements of the surface over a long period of time and compute an average surface it will be level.  It will also be bumpy not flat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
