		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeds generally require three things to &quot;decide&quot; to germinate: warmth, oxygen, and water. </p>
<p>Water affects seeds by causing them to swell enormously and break through their coating, allowing the seed to begin to grow. At the same time, the water activates hydrolytic enzymes (chemicals which cause water to react with other chemicals, producing hydroxides and hydrides), and these enzymes break down stored food and other nutrients in the seed into useful things which the plant can use to grow - an example being the breakdown of stored starch into sugar (glucose) molecules, which can be used by the germinating seed to respire aerobically and produce energy for all sorts of things, as well as the production of cellulose for cell walls.</p>
<p>Oxygen is required for the seed to germinate because it is used in many processes, but most importantly, aerobic respiration which provides energy to the plant (as mentioned above). The seed simply cannot germinate without oxygen.</p>
<p>Temperature affects many chemical reactions in the plant, and usually lower temperature means slower/no reaction, which again means that the seed cannot grow and germinate. A sudden rise in temperature allows reactions to occur, which in turn allows the seed to germinate.</p>
<p>How do the seeds hibernate? Well, a seed is robust, and requires a very tiny amount of energy to remain living. Similar to how a chicken egg can remain dormant and rely on minuscule nutrition for 10 days while the mother chicken decides whether or not to sit on it, the living part of a seed (called the embryo - <a href="https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zhp4q6f/small" target="_blank">here's a diagram</a>) can also consume tiny quantities of food and remain living for a long time, waiting for the right conditions to begin growing. The embryo has evolved to survive on a small amount of nutrients in a number of ways. A huge proportion of the energy intake of a human is spent on heating the body; plants do not heat themselves, and so don't need to spend energy on this. This is also the main reason that a snake can eat a deer and not eat again for weeks or months. The embryo doesn't grow or repair itself either, another large expense of energy for most life. It is incredibly efficient.</p>
<p>In the case of the Siberian seeds which were germinated after 32,000 years, the freezing, oxygen-starved and dry conditions in which the seeds were kept would have slowed down the processes of the embryo significantly, allowing for more longevity, as the embryo would consume its stores at a much slower rate. In carefully controlled lab conditions, with the right care, the seeds are able to germinate - although they probably wouldn't have been able to do so if they had just been planted in some field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The mature seeds had been damagedâ€”perhaps by the squirrel itself, to prevent them from germinating in the burrow. But some of the immature seeds retained viable plant material.</p>
<p>The team extracted that tissue from the frozen seeds, placed it in vials, and successfully germinated the plants, according to a new study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think they sprouted like normal seeds. It sounds like they used tissue culture to do it. I know in the other <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/051122-old-plant-seed-food/" target="_blank">2,000 year old seeds that previously held the record</a> they had to treat the seeds so they could absorb water, provide nutrients for it and it took months to germinate a seed. Still pretty amazing though.</p>
<p>edit: They have also revived <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reviving-ancient-bacteria/" target="_blank">250 million year old bacteria</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
