		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won’t go into the question of additives – each brand of gasoline has its own formulation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gasoline_additives" target="_blank">mix of additives</a> – these will obviously make the product at the pump different from one brand to the next, but it is a bit of a trite and trivial answer.</p>
<p>There are, however, some variations induced by the refining process. Some are deliberate. Gasoline is not a pure substance, but a mix of hydrocarbon chains of different lengths, say C4 to C12. For instance, regular will have less of the longer-chained hydrocarbons in the mix than super, so that’s a difference right there. This is what is meant by the octane rating - which indicates what proportion of your gasoline is made up of the eight-carbon molecule octane. Different batches will also have slight variations in the relative ratios of each specific molecule. Not huge, but measurable.</p>
<p>Then, there are stable isotope signatures. These are cool. Hydrocarbon deposits form with a certain initial ratio of carbon isotopes (C^12 to C^13 ); these will vary with local temperature conditions when the initial source organisms were alive and a few other processes during diagenesis and maturation - long story shorth: these signatures are different for deposits from different time periods (see, for instance: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375674277900802" target="_blank">Fuex, A. N. (1977). The use of stable carbon isotopes in hydrocarbon exploration. Journal of Geochemical Exploration, 7, 155-188.</a>). These signatures are not affected much by the refining process, so, provided you do not mix material from different deposits during cracking, you should be able to distinguish gasoline produced from deposits with a different initial isotopic signature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since this is /r/askscience you've gotten the chemical answers to your question but I'll add something about the market too. </p>
<p>Gasoline is what's known as a fungible commodity, like non-organic whole milk. When one supplier has too much, it sells it as a generic product to another buyer. For example, if Exxon cooks too much gasoline then they will sell the &quot;leftovers&quot; to a different company. You might ask why they would give their competitors a supply, but the process of making gasoline is expensive, long, and complicated, and disposal so difficult, that they really only need to make pennies on the dollar to justify the sale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a refinery!</p>
<p>Gasoline is most definately a blend.  There are generally environmental regulations it must meet (like vapour pressure, etc.).  In order to meet that criteria, they use a mixture of different products.</p>
<p>I was never in the blending department, but my understanding is that gasoline is not an exact recipe.  Its more like a goal to reach the standards set for octane and various environmental requirements.  </p>
<p>That means if they have an abundance of a product, they'll use as much of it as they can.  In order to meet their product specification goals, they'll blend other products to get the results they want.</p>
<p>In oil refineries, when they separate out different factions of oil (distilling oil), they talk about oil by the carbon chain length.  I think gasoline is C-5 to C-8, which means 5 to 8 carbon atoms (every carbon atom is either attached to another carbon atom or hydrogen atom, so they omit the hydrogen part in the atom description).</p>
<p>So that means the base of gasoline is most likely hydrocarbon chains that have 5 to 8 carbon atoms, and are blended with various other ingredients to meet specifications.</p>
<p>It is true that each major brand has their own additives.  the additives are an incredibly minor part of the formula.  I've heard as little as 1 gallon of additive in a 5000 gallon tank.</p>
<p>What the blending means is that batch by batch, even with the same manufacturer, gasoline quality can vary.  As far as cars go, you'd probably never notice.  I know I personally have noticed on a my motorcycle the difference when I fill up in different places.</p>
<p>To further explain that gasoline is a blend, they do octane tests on gasoline batches before it can be sold for distribution.  If you notice on the pump at the gas station, it usually tells you how the octane was formulated.  I think it says method vs test or something.  They use a program to determine the spec after blending the desired ingredients.  Then they have to test for octane in a machine that measures it.  If gasoline was always they same, they wouldn't need to test it every batch.</p>
<p>Also, its not abnormal or an entire tank of gasoline (50,000 gallons or whatever) to fail to meet specification.  That means that tank either has be be diluted with good gasoline or they have to re-run the entire tank through the process again and start over.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm addition to the above, refiners vary formulas seasonally to address the need for higher volatility in the winter to aid cold starting. Conversely, in the summer a less volatile formula is used to reduce evaporative losses.  The octane rating in both cases is the same, but the constituents in the fuel are quite different</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many regulations on how gasoline is formulated. They are based, for the most part, on how it behaves in an engine (like octane rating) and how it behaves in the environment (like limiting benzene concentration). If you are interested in this stuff, which is pretty much inside baseball, see the US EPA regs here <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gasoline-standards/federal-gasoline-regulations" target="_blank">https://www.epa.gov/gasoline-standards/federal-gasoline-regulations</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
