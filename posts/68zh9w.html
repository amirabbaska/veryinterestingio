<p>Might be a dumb question, but it's bugging me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An excellent question in my opinion, or at least one I've wondered about on my own before. </p>
<p>There are a few ways to look at this, and it is often far more illuminating to see a problem from multiple sides so I will briefly talk through two lines of thinking.</p>
<p>The first is to consider the balance of energy; the motivation for your question is that the water molecules must have gained energy in order to move upwards. It is certainly true that the gravitational potential of the water+paper once the water has soaked upwards is higher than before, so this energy has come from somewhere.</p>
<p>The truth is that the total energy of the system clearly includes more than just the gravitational potential energy, it also includes the surface energy which is the energy inherent to the interface, the bonds, between two substances.  The easiest way to imagine surface energy is to consider a droplet, it is obvious that the bonds between water and water is stronger than water and air because otherwise water would not clump into a droplet, it would want to spread out, to maximize it's surface area in order to decrease the total energy of the state. This means that water-air has a high surface energy. This is not the case for the water-paper interface which is very low energy since the water molecules can have strong intermolecular forces with the molecules of the paper.</p>
<p>As such, our water wants to increase the amount of contact it has with the paper as it will be at lower energy but doing so increases it's gravitational energy so you reach a new equilibrium where the water will soak up the paper just far enough such that the increase in gravitational energy of the system is equal in magnitude to the decrease in the total surface energy.</p>
<p>Another way of exploring this is to consider the force of adhesion; if you have ever looked at a glass of water then you will notice that the fluid at the very edge clings to the side slightly, lifting the surface at the edges in opposition to the surface tension which wants to minimize the surface area. This is because the molecules of the glass have stronger bonds with the water than other molecules of water so they pull the edge of the liquid up slightly. This is another manifestation of the lower surface energy of the water-glass interface compared to the water-air interface.</p>
<p>If you had a narrow glass tube then you could imagine that around all sides the water is being pulled up. If we imagine a column of water being lifted, the extra gravitational potential will be proportional to the radius of the tube squared (pi * r^2 * h) and the adhesive force will proportional to the radius of the tube (2 * pi * r) then there will very clearly come a cross over point where, as you reduce r, the adhesive force overcomes the gravitational force.</p>
<p>This is the origin of the upwards force in a capillary tube and your paper, which essentially is entirely constructed of small channels, or tubes which water can flow through, also has a capillary force in it. Allowing it to suck up the water.</p>
<p>Hope that was interesting or at least answered your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is Surface Energy.  While you are increasing the gravitational potential energy of the system by raising the mass of water, you are lowering the surface energy of the napkin and water system.</p>
<p>Honestly, I believe surface energy is one of those topics that doesn't get enough coverage at the High School and undergraduate level, or maybe it was just my education was lacking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called capillary action.
Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel will cause an upward force on the liquid at the edges and result in a meniscus which turns upward. The surface tension acts to hold the surface intact. Capillary action occurs when the adhesion to the walls is stronger than the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy for the water to go into the napkin is similar to the energy that dissolves sugar in a glass of water, the favorable between-molecule (aka intramolecular) interactions between the individual water molecules and the napkin molecules - which as long strands of carbohydrate cellulose. The energy for the water to go into the napkin also has to do with entropy - the statistical likelihood of distribution of matter as well as energy. Water has an uneven charge distribution because the oxygen atom has more of a pull on the electrons than the hydrogen atoms. This makes it have a net negative end and a net positive end - an electric dipole. Cellulose is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen true to its name. It also has many dipoles. The oxygen-hydrogen motif lends to a relatively strongly interacting dipole called hydrogen bonding because of the magnitude of the electrical charge distribution difference.</p>
<p>Though water does indeed interact energetically favorably with itself due to these dipoles, it can also hydrogen bond with the cellulose fibers of a napkin which also contain oxygen-hydrogen patterns which are called &quot;-hydroxl&quot; groups. It is such that water-water interactions can be similar to the interaction between the water and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. </p>
<p>But if it's similar in interaction and presumably about equal in intramolecular energy profiles then why does the water spread up the napkin? Our universe follows the law of increasing entropy. If you put a drop of dye in a glass of water, our intuition says that the drop of dye will spread through the glass with time. Things and energy tend to spread out. Like I mentioned before, this is terms entropy and it has an associated energy as well. </p>
<p>So let's do the reverse - getting water out of the napkin. You squash the napkin with your hand and the water boops out into a pool. Clearly you've put energy into the water-napkin system. Your hand energy broke up the water-hydroxyl intramolecular energy and got the water to go back to interacting with itself. If you leave the squashed napkin in the pool of booped water then the napkin probably won't reabsorb like it did unless it's a premium brand paper towel. What's different? </p>
<p>Well a new dry napkin doesn't have hydroxyl groups of the napkin interacting with each other, it's more fluffy so the hydroxyl groups interact with the air. When it's wet and squished however, the situation is changed - the hydroxyl groups of the napkin are probably interacting with other hydroxyl groups of the napkin with something resembling hydrogen bonding but probably not exactly like it as the oxygens and hydrogens won't be able to line up just right. So there's a reduction in bond energy here - the water isn't coming in and making new hydrogen bonding interactions anymore, it's coming in and breaking up hydrogen bonding style interactions to replace them with hydrogen bonding interactions - not as favorable. The smooshed together fibers also have less room for the water, so the water can't spread around as easily in an entropically favorable way. When the smooshed napkin dries it still has its fibers interacting with each other and so it can become kind of hard in texture. </p>
<p>Summary: The energy comes from water molecules interacting with the hydroxyl groups of the napkin which were previously interacting only with air, and from entropy - the universal law where things spread out (or assume the most probable microstates).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right so all we need to do now is create a giant napkin hang it up in a massive tub of water which has 2 giant rollers either side of it attached to a hydrolics and pulleys or whatever and as the napkin soaks up water gets heavy it pulls the rollers up they release roll all the water out and then falls down to drive a turbine which then after gets soaked back into the napkin to start again... i just solved the energy crisis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
