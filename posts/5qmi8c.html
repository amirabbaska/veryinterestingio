		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, that third of your life is spent sleeping, which you would very quickly die without. I'd say that means lying down is <em>definitely</em> healthier than <em>not</em> doing it.</p>
<p>As for sitting down, it's unhealthy because it's not a natural position to be in for extended periods. We're supposed to be moving around a lot. You know how blood circulates around your body? Well, your heart is great at pushing it <em>down</em>, but not pulling it back <em>up</em>. Walking helps your blood circulate - we've evolved so that the muscles we use for walking help push the blood back up our bodies. </p>
<p>When you're lying down, gravity isn't that big of a problem. </p>
<p>That's just <em>one</em> reason. We're also not supposed to have a sedentary lifestyle. We're supposed to get a decent amount of sleep (as discussed earlier, lack of it <em>will</em> be detrimental to the point of lethality) but other than that we're built to be active and we've not evolved out of that. So sitting around all day means we're conserving way too much energy that our body doesn't have anything to do with, so it stores it was fat, which makes our body <em>less</em> efficient and means we need even <em>more</em> exercise. </p>
<p>Again - we've evolved to sleep for ~8 hours, and then be active most of the rest. Not doing either of those is not healthy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what was added by others sitting is bad for the muscles in your hips. Your hip flexors get shortened and tigtened because your body now thinks that sitting is your natural position and will actuslly begin to remove sarcomeres from the muscle fibers. Your hip extenders (ie. Glutes)  become stretched out and lengthened as well causing them to become weaker. Now you have created a muscle imbalance in some of the primary muscles involved in your gait cycle. </p>
<p>The forces on the vertrbral discs in your spine also change as you lay stand and sit. Laying down puts no pressure on your spine, standing puts 100% more pressure on the spine , sitting increases this force to 150%. Sitting down and bending over is even worse clocking in at 200% of the normal force on your spine. </p>
<p>There are also some numbers dealing with calories burnt while sleeping standing and sitting , i couldnt tell you the exact numbers off the top of my head but sitting burns the least per hour. </p>

When you sleep the pressure is spread about your whole body. Certain sleeping positions can be painful though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>sitting your compunding your spine and discs and putting preasue on it.  My dad basically had a job that required him to sit in a chair all day 5 days a week and at age 60 he had to have back surgery just from sitting all day( he played no sports or had no accidents that would have contributed) Laying down your body is in a more natural position and your not putting such a strain on the spine or discs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping laying down is good. Sleeping sitting down is not as good. Not sleeping is fatal. Basically it improves circulation and speeds up your body's natural functions. Not sure how it works exactly but it does. It's why when you're sick you recover a little quicker if you stand or recline most of the time. Think that's why standing desks are becoming a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
