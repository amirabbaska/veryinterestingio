		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's going to have their own reason, that somewhat reflects their opinions of society, so that needs to be considered, but my two cents:</p>
<p>Values and costs related to raising children.  It wasn't until fairly recently that a person would study and train for 20 years before they could start working, and education beyond that would largely effect how much you would make.  That means that in order for a child to begin making money, they need to be a full-grown independent adult, with substantial financial investment by their parents.  </p>
<p>This wasn't the case in the past.  100 years ago, a relatively young child, with relatively non-existent education could be economically productive, especially in less developed, more agricultural areas.  That means that a child could spend something like 10 years working before they were ready to go out on their own, which was an economic benefit to their families, lessening workload, <em>and</em> providing a sort of retirement plan.  They were an investment.</p>
<p>In those situations, it wasn't just economically feasible to be a stay-at-home mom, it was good business, a woman could find herself doing much better in most situations with a horde of children doing chores in a farm or working in factories, this incentivized getting <em>and staying</em> married.  </p>
<p>Today, your eight year old son, for most situations, isn't tending to the livestock.  They're going to school, costing money, and will likely leave the moment they become economically self-sufficient (in their mid-20s).  That means that raising kids is something you do for fun or self-fulfillment, and marriage goes right along with it.  If you don't want to spend all of your time raising six kids, you don't need a spouse to either make money or manage the household.</p>
<p>If you don't <em>need</em> a spouse, then the only thing keeping you together is feelings and emotion, which no matter how sentimental a person is, just doesn't have the same pull as &quot;My plan for when I get old is to live in this same house with these kids taking care of me, and if we get divorced, I'll have nothing.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind is that, until the mid-1970s, no-fault divorces were not legal in the US.  The only way to get out of a bad marriage was for one spouse to do something seriously wrong, like committing infidelity or (seriously) physically abusing the other.</p>
<p>That's why <a href="https://www.papermasters.com/images/divorce-rate.jpg" target="_blank">the US divorce rate</a> rapidly went up through the 1970s, peaking in 1980 and has been going down steadily since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People rushed into marriage early on because that's how it had been done in the past, and because of the social pressures against pre-marital sex, etc. So if people wanted to engage in that, then they rushed into marriages. And marriages in the past weren't more successful, it's just that people were trapped in them -- both genders because of societal pressures, and women because they had limited means to support themselves. That's why, when divorce did become more accepted in the 70's, there were a ton of divorces... people who may have wanted out of marriages for a decade or more finally felt they could leave a bad marriage. The rate has actually fallen over time after those initial divorces happened, and also as people have waited longer to marry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
