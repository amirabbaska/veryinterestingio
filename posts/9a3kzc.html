		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few known instances of this, mostly in animals but a handful of examples from humans.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4698198/" target="_blank">a paper</a> on the topic in animals. Most famously, a canine STD and facial tumors in Tasmanian Devils are transmissible cancers.  Syrian golden hamsters also have multiple independent origins of mosquito-borne cancers in lab settings. And a transmissible &quot;leukemia&quot; is known from softshell clams.</p>
<p>In some cases (the Tasmanian devils and especially the hamsters) we know populations are highly inbred and genetically similar, making it easier for cancers to survive when transplanted. Canine and tasmanian cancers also have adaptations for evading the immune system, which have been documented.</p>
<p>In humans, the only known examples are related to medical procedures. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undifferentiated_pleomorphic_sarcoma#Transmissible_infection" target="_blank">a case</a> of a cancer being transmitted to a surgeon who injured his hand while operating, and cancers are sometimes  transmitted along with organs being donated.  Back in the 50's-60's a doctor <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/143/3606/551" target="_blank">injected live HeLa cells</a> into patients, transmitting cancer to some (side note: what the hell!). </p>
<p>Some cancers are also caused by transmissible viruses, but that's not really the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>So yes, cancer cells can be transmitted. <em>Usually</em> the host immune system wipes them out, but if the host and donor are genetically similar or the cancer cells have the right mutations, they can make the jump. Surgical transplantation isn't always necessary. These things are pretty rare though.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, these cancers (especially the longer-lived ones like the canine tumor) can in some ways be considered single-celled, parasitic species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumors the lack of genetic diversity is compounded by the degradation of the cadherein protein that keeps the cells sticking together which facilitated the spread. </p>
<p>Also no one has mentioned HPV yet? Same kind that the virus causes the cancer and is transmissible like canine HIV. But DFT has the actual cells break of and be incorporated in the new devils tumors because they’re so inbred their immune system doesn’t know</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible with certain cancers, specifically those caused by viruses. </p>
<p>Some cancers can also result in teratomas, which are growths with a number of different types of tissue within them, such as teeth, hair, skin, pieces of muscle etc. The reason this happens is because the cell can pass normal restrictions to keep them defined due to mutations in genes keeping cells differentiated. They regain pluripotency and these cells would most like be able to cause tumour formation in someone else if the cells were injected. A lot of experiments showed this in Yamanaka's experiments to identify the 4 factors that can induce pluripotency in a differentiated cell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
