		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a wide range of variation in the number and frequency of offspring. This has been studied under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory" target="_blank">R- or K-strategists</a>. Essentially, it comes down to a trade off between quantity and quality. Humans have very much gone down the 'quality' path - we spend a lot of time and energy raising each child. As such, we are an extreme K-selected species.</p>
<p>As a result of this, each child has a very good chance of surviving to adulthood and having offspring of their own. The opposite end of the spectrum is to have many offspring, but each receiving very little care. For example, most fish lay clutches of hundreds of eggs, and then leave them the hatch and fend for themselves. The mortality rate is very high - many eggs and young fish are eaten, and others will starve do death or die of disease. As such, despite the huge numbers of eggs produced, very few go on to reach adulthood. This is a typical R-selected strategy.</p>
<p>Of course, these are two extremes on a spectrum, most animals fall somewhere in the middle. Species breeding patterns will evolve toward one end or the other according to the specific ecological conditions prevailing. Furthermore, there is even evidence that <em>individuals</em> of some species can alter the number and quality of offspring <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/210/4474/1148" target="_blank">according to the local conditions</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human newborns are very vulnerable and remain this way for an extended period of time. We're not able to walk, communicate very well or defend ourselves at all.  Only having one child at a time allows for a greater chance of successful development since the parent can focus solely on the newborn's extensive needs and complex upbringing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies based on a number of things such as gestation, length of time the young stays with their mother, how active of a parent they are, and overall survival rate of the species. For example, frogs lay tons of eggs. That said, it's easy for those eggs to be eaten. Her tadpoles are also easy prey, so she has to lay lots of eggs to ensure that some survive. Mom doesn't really do much after the eggs are laid in most species, so she's free to mate again pretty shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Dolphins and elephants are typically closer to us. They invest several years raising their offspring. Their social structures improve the safety of the young and therefore give them better chances of survival. Like us, they only breed every few years because of the tremendous amount of work they put into raising their young. They just don't have the time or resources for more.</p>
<p>Even going back in human history, you can see similar trends. Back in centuries past, women tended to have more children because few of them survived to adulthood. Now that our survival rates have improved, our children live longer, they take more time and resources to raise, therefore we need fewer of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horses, hippos, goats, sheep,  and cows all tend to only have 1 or 2 offspring, not litters. These animals are neither intelligently nor gentically close to humans. This trait is certainly not unique to humans or even to intelligent animals.</p>
<p>Whether an animal is able to have a litter of offspring depends on multiple factors including 1) the shape of the uterus and 2) predation. Animals with uteruses that have horns (like dogs) are able to have litters because the offspring are lined up along each of the horns. In humans the uterus has only one cavity  and so humans are unable to have litters. </p>
<p>As other answer have mentioned, having multiple offspring is advantageous to prey animals because the genes will still be passed on. This may explain why primates (including humans) and large herbivores are tend to only have one offspring  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory is that of r/K species. r-species are ones who invest little effort into raising offspring, expect very high mortality rates, and thus produce prodigious progeny. An example could be a fish spawning thousands of eggs in the &quot;hopes&quot; a few will live. K-species are those that invest significant resources into their offspring, have relatively low mortality, and thus better spend their time raising one or a few offspring. Whales and humans would fall into this category.
