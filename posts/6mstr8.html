If in a partial transplant there will always be foreign donor cells than does the ratio of donor to host stay the same?</p>

It can be possible to wean off of antirejection drugs as your body gets used to the new organ, but if your whole liver is replaced by a donor liver, you do not have any of your own liver cells to replicate and replace the donor cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there is a transplant, wether partial or full, it is always the donor's cells, no matter for how long you have had it. Even in a bone marrow transplant (one that is not autologous - not a self transplant) will result in the production of donor blood cell. This is the reason that an organ transplant also includes a lifetime of immunosuppresant drugs, resulting in an increased risk of infection for the patient.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are three types of tissues (depending on replication potential):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Liable tissues -  new cells are continuously being produced from basal cells - e.g. the skin, mucosa (inner lining) of the intestines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stable tissues - which only undergo replication when there is significant stress to the organ - e.g. tge liver, kidneys... the liver is particularly special, if you cut a lobe of the liver or let's say half of it, it will mostly hypertrophy (the cells will increase in size), and even hyperplasia (increase number of cells) of hepatocytes (liver cells) [the missing lobe will never grow back, only the residual liver tissue grows] The new tissue will take up the same space as the full size liver, restoring most of the function.<br />

</li>
<li>Permanent tissues - these never undergo cell replication (at least not after embryological development) - e.g. the brain and heart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important not is that organs which have a higher replication potential and replicate more often, have an increased chance to accumulate mutations and cause tumours!</p>
<p>Edit: added hyperplasia and cleared up some stuff, also provided a link :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has received a heart transplant, I can tell you, I will always be on immunoseppresent drugs and anti-rejection drugs for this reason. Its been 10 years and yes I take less than when I started but if I were to stop now, my body would reject my heart just as much as it would have 10 years ago</p>
<p>Edit:  I just wanna say thank you so much for all the lovely words and interesting questions. Honestly I get so used to the generic questions that normally come with this topic, so it's always nice to actually have to think hard about my answers. Thank you for making my morning cool. I love talking about my transplant with people who are actually interested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. And actually in some cases, it might lead to very interesting scenarios. I had leukemia when I was younger and went through a bone marrow trasnplant from my brother. Since your original bone marrow is destroyed before this procedure (by chemo in my case), it was fully replaced by bone marrow with my brother's DNA. Bone marrow produces the blood that courses through your body, which means that my blood has my brother's DNA and the rest of my body (for example a cheek swab or my skin cells) have my own DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
