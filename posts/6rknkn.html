		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the diet is unhealthy, but you stress that they are not gaining weight, then it would imply it is unhealthy in that they are receiving insufficient/excessive nutrition <em>of some form</em>. The effects of this would depend then on what nutrition they are lacking in, or receiving an excess of. Improper amounts of nutrients can have a variety of impacts, all the way up to death. All without making you weigh any more than you do now. But the specifics would depend on the diet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It decreases performance and general well-being. Vitamin and mineral deficiences lead to things like exhaustion, headaches, weakened immune system, lower sex drive etcetra. There are a myriad of minor problems that arise when you don't eat properly. You still function, just not as well. The biggest noticeable improvement from an increased diet would be the feeling of being more energetic and alert throughout the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever heard about those people who lose weight by going on junk food diets? That's because most important factor by far in gaining/losing weight is calories in vs calories out. Everyone is supposed to have a certain amount of calories a day, the average being 2000. It can vary a lot depending on the size/age/gender of the person. When a skinny person eats and unhealthy diet and doesn't gain any weight from it, it means they are eating a small amount of food and low quality food. This would prevent them from gaining any muscle. They could actually lose muscle due to not having enough protein. They would lack energy overall, too. The most dangerous and notable effect would be malnutrition. Eating and unhealthy diet won't give you all the nutrients you need for your body to replenish itself, especially if you aren't eating enough food in the first place. Depending on how severe the diet is, your body could be affected in multiple terrible ways, such as feeling like your always sick or even a weakened immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a common misconception that the major downside of unhealthy diet is gaining weight.  Apart from all that is mentioned here on the comments, the major downside is that it affects your <strong>cardiac health</strong>.   The truth is, a person with any body type can have high cholesterol. <em>People who donâ€™t get overweight easily are often less aware of how much saturated and trans fat they eat.</em> Nobody can eat anything they want and stay heart-healthy.  The bad cholesterol can lead to buildup and eventually block your arteries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who deals with this, all of the answers I've seen so far pretty much nail it by mentioning malnutrition and /u/4noop gets to the heart of it (pun possibly intended) with cardiac health. High blood pressure and heart issue run in my family so even though I can eat a pound of bacon and not gain any weight I still shouldn't. When I do start eating more junk food and fast food I get hungry sooner and super moody after a few days. I also get exhausted which takes me longer than the average person to recover from because my body struggles to catch up. </p>
<p>A large majority of my diet is protein and junk food doesn't provide nearly enough of this to keep me going on a day-to-day basis. One of the trickiest parts of this whole ordeal is that I'm not supposed to eat things that use more calories to digest that I get from them (raw vegetables, grapefruit, etc.) so eating healthy can be really tricky and also time consuming to a degree. I'm physically small, which means my stomach (despite that I seriously tried to stretch it out over a few months by having a beer every day) is small so I eat many meals over the course of an entire day. Unless I have them all planned out ahead of time at least one of them is going to be lacking in the nutrient department. Stuff like Ensure has been a live saver in some situations. Hopefully this is a helpful answer to your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
