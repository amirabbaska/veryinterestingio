		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All chemical reactions are based on interactions between the electrons of atoms.  To understand rust and tarnish, you need to understand how metals react.  Rust and tarnish are generally made when a metal reacts with other compounds containing oxygen or sulfur in the surrounding environment (air/water/ground) and water. </p>
<p>Other commenters have talked about how stable gold is, but the chemical reason behind this stability is due to gold's &quot;valence&quot; electrons; the outermost electrons in a gold atom.  These electrons are the ones that are able to react.  These electrons are found in regions around the atom called orbitals which can only take a certain amount of electrons before they fill up.  What we see in gold (and other group 11 elements) is that the orbitals which contain the reactive electrons are actually at full capacity.  Atoms like it a lot when these orbitals are filled and it ends up taking too much energy to add or remove an electron from a gold atom for a reaction to happen with oxygen or sulfur.  This makes gold really resistant to oxidation (rusting/tarnishing).  </p>
<p>Iron, on the other hand, is very reactive with water/oxygen and forms rust (Iron Oxide) pretty quickly.  It gets oxidized by oxygen really quickly because that reaction allows Iron's orbitals to be filled in a more stable way.  It then forms the oxide after reacting with water giving us the red rust we see everywhere.</p>
<p>Side note, there's actually a difference between tarnish and rust.  Tarnish is a layer on top of the metal that insulates it and protects the deeper layers of the metal like the green tarnish on copper (statue of liberty) while rust generally flakes off and cannot protect the metal below (steel and iron rust).  This is why iron things left out will eventually rust completely through while the statue of liberty is still standing.</p>
<p>There are also quantum reasons for the increased stability of gold which explains why we see tarnish on silver but not gold, but that's a little beyond an ELI5. </p>
<p>tl;dr: gold doesn't tarnish because it's happy where it is and it would take too much energy for it to rust or tarnish.</p>
<p>P.S. looking up wikipedia's pages on rust, tarnish, oxidation states and electron filling of transition metals will explain everything a lot better than I can :)</p>
<p>Edit^2: Iron oxide not aluminum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the process of 'tarnishing', or corrosion, is a redox reaction between the metal and oxygen and water, an incredibly stable and unreactive element such as gold will not be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As /u/nickbrisola pointed out, I should also say that gold is a 'passivating' metal. These types of metal react with oxygen to form an impervious oxide layer that prevents from any water or oxygen to be in contact with the metal, hence preventing corrosion. </p>
<p>Other examples of such metals include Aluminium and Chromium. The opposite of these metals are known as 'active' metals and include Iron and Magnesium - which can be easily corroded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Tarnish&quot; is the surface of the metal reacting with various things it comes in contact with, producing the discolouration. Kind of like how orange rust forms on iron (Iron III Oxide)  or the bright green patina that forms on copper (copper carbonate).</p>
<p>Gold is extremely stable. It does not readily react with chemicals found in the environment normally. </p>
<p>So because there is nothing that can react with the surface of the gold, the surface stays exactly how it was at manufacture and does not develop a tarnish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold does not tarnish easily nor does it form a passivation layer like Aluminum, and while most tarnish is an oxidation reaction, silver and Gold tend to react more with sulphur than oxygen. Proof: when polishing silver, the tarnish being removed is black silver sulphide, whereas silver oxide is white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really simple answer....&quot;tarnish&quot;...is a form of corrosion. Corrosion is when a material usually metal wants to break down to its original state when in the prescence of an electrolyte (water, dirt,) Think of an old metal car left outside for years. Corrosion will star at the weak point where the metal is not protected by paint(scratches ding etc) and spread to beneath the surface like an infection. Most metals corrode..iron,steel,brass, over time if not protected (painted or seald from the environment). There are metal that can resist this process..pure aluminum, and gold for example. Your soda cans are aluminum. In fact aluminum is often mixed with other metals to help stregthen its resistance to corrosion.  Gold is far superior than aluminum at resisting corrosion but aluminum is far cheaper an lighter. Fun fact: most planes have a thin layer of pure aluminum on the entire outside to protect the metal underneath from corrosion.
