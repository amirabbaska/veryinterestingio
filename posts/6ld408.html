		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently took a course on wireless networking, and we discussed the physics of radio frequencies to understand the way radio waves propagate.  My professor gave this same demonstration of how placing the key fob under your chin increased the distance it could reach your vehicle.</p>
<p>His explanation was that the signal the key, or antenna, generates radiates omnidirectionally, or in a sphere centered around the key.  By placing it under your chin, you alter the way the radio antenna behaves, changing it from omnidirectional to a directional antenna, so that the waves bounce off our body and merge with the waves going away from our body in one direction, effectively funneling them further away than they could reach just going out in all directions.  The shape of the waves goes from a sphere to more of an oblong shape facing one way.  We aren't adding any power to the strength of the signal, just altering the direction the signal travels in.  He had some neat diagrams to aid in the explanation that I wish I had saved, but that is how I understand it to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't know why it's so fickle, but if other remotes are as fickle as mine then I would suggest what's going on here is confirmation bias.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
