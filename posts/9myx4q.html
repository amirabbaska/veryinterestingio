<p>But we know the water is contaminated, and possibly leaking off-site. Using contaminated water makes the potential leaking water more dangerous. (Even if it's a tiny change) It's also a bad image for Tepco. &quot;Trpco skipping proper disposal of waste water by pouring it out onsite.&quot;</p>
<p>Safe and unsafe levels are defined by amount/volume. For anything. Rat poop in your food. Chemical waste. Rad waste. To make water safe for dumping, you filter it, dilute it, then dump it in the ocean far from land, which does more dilution. How much work before dumping is usually based off of legal standards for country of origin, which may or may not have a scientific backing.</p>
<p>All forms of liquid waste have this problem, but nuclear is worse. Chemical waste can be cleaned chemically and mechanically. Rad waste can need a centrifuge to ensure you pick up all the isotopes. Heavy water is still water, chemically speaking. So a chemical rreaction won't remove it. Ditto for any other isotope of a normally safe element. Some like cesium or lead are easy. They're bad, whether active or not.</p>
<p>Rad waste is also politically more sensitive. Everyone always thinks of fuel pins and control rods. But a ton of waste is low level stuff that's legally classified as waste because of where it was used. Like paper towels or brooms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From my understanding, the water is being recirced from the lower levels of the plant and is being reused for cooling. The liquid waste is being processed to levels that under normal scenarios would be directly releasable to the environment. Most isotopes can be reduced to below detectable levels. Tritium, of course is the one that would remain as it can't be removed without extraordinary equipment and costs. </p>
<p>However, due to the sensitivity of the situation, release of the water, regardless of how well treated has become difficult to be released. If you measure a liquid long enough, you can eventually find some dose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That water could totally be reused. It could (and probably should) also just be dumped into the ocean. The transuranics and fission fragments (i.e. the nasty stuff) are already getting filtered before storage. The stored water is lightly (and I mean really lightly) radioactive due to the presence of tritium. Tritium is probably the least dangerous and conversely, hardest to contain, radioactive material in the world. It has a super low biological half-life (the time something stays in your body) and a very low energy decay. It also likes to changes places with any hydrogen isotope it finds (thus the containment).However, releasing any radioactive material is politically charged, especially when it comes to tritium. From a pure safety stand point, I wouldn’t be bothered if I was to drink or bath in that water. My cancer risk would not change in any detectable way. Once you dump it, or let it leak or whatever, the ocean will dilute it so much that it will essentially be gone. In addition, the ocean is full of naturally occurring radioactive material that will completely overwhelm the presence of a little extra tritium. </p>
<p>You also might wonder about extracting it. Some other posters have addressed that extracting tritium is SUPER hard from normal water. We can separate heavy water with centrifuges or preferential chemistry (the heavy isotope reacts a little tiny bit slower) but that also relies on “large” amounts being present for viability. In this case there is not much tritium there (per liter) so it will be very tricky and expensive to separate. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t remember the exact situation of the reactor, but the stoppage of coolant circulation was due to the failure of the primary pump/turbine cooling system from backflow of multiphase fluid instead of pure steam (combining any non-gas with turbines is a bad idea). This primary pump failure is what lead to the backup RCIC turbine/pump system being used, and that’s what I’m involved with in some of my research. The interesting thing is that the RCIC system was rated to run for like 8 hours tops in an emergency but ended up holding out for close to 3 days. That’s why we’re researching this system, to possibly reevaluate the rating on the max operation time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe that is the reason why they can’t circulate that water currently, and installation of a new pump system is a little out of the question. Add that to the fact that there are areas where leakage is a big factor, and it becomes an issue of contamination control management. You can't just circulate this water if it's going to be leaking externally for a whole host of other reasons.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is a little vague, it’s not really my area of expertise. I just know the basic background because of what I’m working in.</p>
<p>Edit: Here are some sources for brief overviews if you're interested in a background of the system. I will dig up some papers that might be relevant to the subject as well.</p>
