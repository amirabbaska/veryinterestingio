		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is honestly one of the most uninformed threads I have seen. There are only 2 laws that grant Congress immunity that the average person does not have, and they both are related to Congress doing their job. Congressman cannot be detained for minor crimes while on their way to cast a vote, and Congressman cannot be sued for things they say or votes they cast while in a session of Congress.</p>
<p>Both of these protections are very minor and yet very necessary. </p>
<p>But let me emphasize that you often <em>hear</em> news stories that say Congress is exempt from a law, but those news stories are <em>intentionally misleading.</em> Here are a few recent examples.</p>
<p><strong>Congress is exempt from insider trading</strong>. This gets circulating around every year or so and it is 100% false. Congress never has, and never will be, exempt from insider trading laws. When you read these news stories you will find out that Congress is allowed to buy and sell stock with the early knowledge of how their laws will affect companies. But this is <strong>not insider trading</strong>. It sounds like insider trading to someone that does not know the laws, but legally speaking it is not. Congress has to follow all the same insider trading laws as you and I, and it has always been that way.</p>
<p><strong>Congress is exempt from the Affordable Car Act/from the ACA replacement.</strong> This is also 100% false. The ACA set up health care exchanges where people could go if they did not have employer sponsored health insurance (among other things). Congress has employer sponsored health insurance as they are a government employees. Thus they will not use the exchanges, and somehow this got to people reporting that they were &quot;exempt&quot; from it. They are not exempt. </p>
<p>Just as if Congress passed a law that regulated Alaska crab fishing, you would not say they are exempt from the law because none of them are currently crab fisherman. They just passed a law that does not directly affect them. They do it all the time, that is their job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The straightforward answer is that Congress makes the laws, so if it passes a law that says Congress is exempt, and there's no law blocking such an exemption, then Congress is exempt.  </p>
<p>So, why would Congress make itself exempt from anything?  In some cases, the rules deal with things Congress doesn't want to do to itself, such as giving some protections to their own workers.  In other cases, it's just for more innocent, logistical purposes.  For example, as part of the recent Republican efforts to pass a new healthcare law, Congress exempted itself to avoid a conflict related to which committee can alter congressional health plans.  That being said, another bill was written to un-exempt Congress.  (<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/congress-exempt-gop-health-bill/" target="_blank">Here's a longer explanation.</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a standard all across the world for members of parliament to have some protection rights. For example, they can't be detained for some smaller crime until parliament waives their immunity. They also can't be prosecuted for the things they say while performing the duty of an MP. </p>
<p>Why? Because, unlike in the US, it has been relatively common for dictators to arise from the executive branch of govt in which case the parliament is either obedient from the start or the dictator removes problematic MPs because police found &quot;evidence&quot; that they're criminals so that they can be removed and replaced.</p>
<p>So they have immunity rights, which is still not a guarantee against this sort of thing but is still better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These laws are put in place with good intentions. For example, the Congress and most state legislatures have a law that says representatives can't be arrested on their way or from the capitol. That's a very important law that can keep a corrupt local sheriff from detaining a state legislator just long enough that they miss the vote on the 2017 Hold Corrupt Sheriffs Accountable Act. But like any other law, this one can be abused, or made subject to a bogus defense claim. It's easy to find examples of legislators disputing a DUI or reckless driving charge by claiming they were on their way to a vote.</p>
<p>Some of these &quot;exempt themselves from laws&quot; things are a matter of interpretation. For example, in my home state, legislators are allowed to carry a concealed weapon. That might sound like a special privilege until you realize there's little difference between their CCW privileges and yours. Congressman Smith still can't carry a gun into a bar or on an airplane. And like the above no-arrests example, this law is designed with sensible intentions: think back to the civil rights movement, when a legislator could legitimately fear for their safety for voting against segregation. So really it is just another law intended to protect government officials.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that the laws that apply to office holders <em>while in office</em>. Despite any voter complacency, the people do have some say in the matter, and it's not a freebies-for-life sort of deal. Once you're out, you're out. And since it's an elected office, so you could at least theoretically attain the office yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
