		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have different types of acne, so it’s really difficult to just talk about one cause and propose one treatment to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Very broadly, you have three types of acne: comedonal acne, inflammatory acne, and drug-induced acne.  I’ll just focus on the first two, because that’s what most people are concerned about.  </p>
<p>The root of most acne lies in the hair follicle.  Your skin produces oils called sebum to lubricate your hair and skin.  These pores can become clogged and produce comedones (which are your “blackheads” or “whiteheads” depending on whether the comedone surface has been oxidized by the air).  If you want to treat comedonal acne, you need to use a topical retinoid (which is a derivative of Vitamin A) and this will interfere with sebum production.</p>
<p>Now in other cases, these plugged pores can become a site where bacteria take up residence, and this leads to pustules, papules, cysts.  This is inflammatory acne.  At that point, you need to add an antibiotic or two along with a retinoid to attack both problems.  So you really need a doctor to classify what type of acne you have before you can figure out what treatments you need.</p>
<p>Most people have acne in their teenage years because they have higher levels of steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen or testosterone) which promote sebum production and the development of comedones.  As their hormone levels stabilize through puberty, sebum production will level off.  I’ll leave it to the dermatologists to tell you the best ways care for your skin.  But aside from medications, you want to keep your skin clean and moisturized at a level where you’re not allowing sebum to build up, but your skin is also not too dry and cracked that your skin bacteria can invade and cause inflammatory acne.  Finding the balance can be difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it can be caused or made worse by a lot of things.
Washing your face with the wrong soap can dry your skin out and cause it, but another soap can make your skin oily and cause it.
Washing too often can be an issue, but so can no washing.
Your diet can cause your skin to produce more oil, and exercising while often a way to clear your skin can also cause it.
A lot of what causes acne is thought to be genetic, but there's also strong arguments that it's environmental.
So without being able to pin down one exact cause you can only treat it, not prevent it outright- think of it like the common cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what kind of acne you’re talking about. Cystic acne is caused by oil and/or dead skin plugging your hair follicles. This creates acne deep in the skin where topical products cannot really reach it &amp; do not help much. </p>
<p>Isotretinoin (AKA accutane) treats all (?) forms of acne. It’s a pill, typically taken twice daily for a set number of months. The dosage is calculated by a dermatologist. Most people see permanent results. Head over to r/accutane to see some before &amp; afters. </p>
<p>Edit : so many replies. TL;DR - isotretinoin can be great. It can also cause unwanted, possibly long lasting side effects. Speak with your derm about concerns if you’re considering it. A dr will be able to recommend what’s best on a case by case basis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD here: Acne is the most common skin desease, can be presented as inflammatory or non-inflammatory(only black heads) and be mild, moderate and severe.
There are 3 factores that contribute the most to its genesis and perpetuity.
1) skin descamation: the rate the layers of skin are &quot;loosening&quot;.
2) oil production: amount of oil produced by the skin.
3) bacterial flora: which kind of bacteria and the proportion of them living normally in the skin.</p>
<p>Most of the factors are influenced enviormentally,  there is no proven monogene transmission but there is a familial association with number 1 and 2, oil production is mediated by a lot of factors (skin washing, humidity, sensibility to androgens) and is usually the way its treated. Dietary influence of &quot;oilyness&quot; is marginal and non statistically significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
