I understand the disease travels along the nerves to the CNS, and ultimately affects the brain. The specifics on how it attaches to the host cell are all written in medical terms and complicated language. Is there anyone who can explain how the rabies virus interacts with a human cell, in simple terms?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rabies virus (via typical transmission) is injected into muscle from the saliva of an injected bite. I assume you had that much already.</p>
<p>These muscle cells can be considered the staging area for the invasion by the virus. The concentration of the virus in the saliva is meant to be strong; that's the reason why the virus has an adaptive quality that makes the clinically infected hydrophobic (adverse to drinking water), so that there isn't a dilution effect to the virus spread during the shedding phase when the epithelial cells are actively making and distributing the viral packets. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to be successful, the virus needs a certain concentration as well as the appropriate positioning within the body to be able to travel up the peripheral nervous system, it's infection super highway to the brain. They do this by infecting muscle cells and it is believed that they infect them at the acetylcholine receptors which can be thought of as the muscle's firing pin where it's activated by the peripheral nervous system. </p>
<p>From there the virus replicates within the muscle cells and the buds into the scant fluid between the cells, particularly at the junction between the muscle cell and the nearest axon terminal (nerve ending). These viral particles coat themselves in clathrin, a protein that's used to transport information and nutrients between cells. These clathrin coated viral particles are taken up by the axon endings and then collectively travel up the scaffolding of the cell called the microtubular structure. They'll use method of travel to go all the from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system, although the exact mechanism through which they hop from nerve cell to nerve cell isn't certain. </p>
<p>The virus will travel to the brain, but it's primary goal is to infect the hippocampal region of the brain, in order to activate the furious aspect of the disease, and the cranial nerves to infect the salivary gland epithelial cells to be able to spread the disease through the saliva. Occasionally, the virus accidentally infects the cerebellum and activates the &quot;dumb&quot; version of the disease which results in a lower chance of the disease spreading itself. </p>
<p>Not sure if that's the kind of detail you're looking for or if you're looking for something else. Hope it helps. Good luck on your paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
