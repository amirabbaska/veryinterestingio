I usually try to listen in a bit because I'm interested, but they always move too fast for me, even though they might be talking at &quot;regular speed&quot;. But, if I'm listening to a conversation in English, they have to be talking exceptionally fast for me to regard it as such. Why is that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not because they are taking faster, usually. Sometimes they are, my high school Spanish teacher told me that Puerto Ricans speak very fast relative to the rest of the Spanish speaking world. But the true reason lies in the fact that you are not accustomed to recognizing natural breaks in the spoken language. Words will blend together or seem to chop up as you're unable to determine where one word ends and another begins. And that's where the speed confusion comes into play. </p>
<p>A couple examples: the Italian phrase &quot;In bocca al lupo&quot; may sound like &quot;Inbo cal upo&quot; to a non-speaker. Likewise the Swahili word &quot;Tunachohitaji&quot; may sound like &quot;Tuna cho hit aji&quot; so while they've only said one word, it sounds like multiple words fired off in rapid succession. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a couple things at work.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When listening, we often don't fully hear every word but, using context, we can make good assumptions about what the word we didn't hear was. Like if someone says &quot;I went to the grocery store and bought eggs&quot; and you didn't hear 'grocery', but maybe only heard a word that ended in y, you can make a good guess that the word was grocery, because what other store do you go to buy eggs right? Sometimes you guess wrong, and that can lead to confusion, you thought someone said something different than what they actually said. But <em>usually</em> your guess is correct. But with a foreign language, this doesn't work, you have no idea what <em>any</em> of the words are, so you don't even know when a word begins or ends, and you have no context available to tease out meaning. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinda related. In conversation, using context, you can often predict the next words people are about to say before they say them. We speak in pretty repetitive ways in everyday conversation, and we use common phrases that you can finish in your head before they fully say the whole thing. You know what words to expect, so you know what to listen for. Someone says &quot;The devil went down--&quot; and you immediately think &quot;--to Georgia&quot; before they've even said it, because we can usually think faster than we can talk. For example, have you noticed you can read a page in a book much faster than you could recite the page out loud? Thinking is faster than speaking. But with a foreign language, you have no idea what to expect. You don't know any of the words, every new sound coming at you is basically a surprise, you can't recognize any of the patterns and common phrases that you're so familiar with in your native tongue.</p>
</li>
<li>Some languages really do speak faster than others. I don't know which ones, and you might feel like foreign-language speakers are speaking faster than you would when really they're not. But some languages really are spoken faster or slower than other languages. Most languages have really subtle rhythms to them, like people have said much of English is spoken in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter" target="_blank">iambic pentameter</a>. </li>

I'm at work right now, so I don't have the time to thank everyone individually that gave an answer. But, thank you to all that have answered my inquiry. I have gained valuable insight as well as more appreciation for this sub. Thank you so much. I will now apply this knowledge in my life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are true, however, they are missing the main factor.  Information density.</p>
<p>English is a very information dense language.  That means that to express a complete thought, you have to use fewer words/syllables.  Spanish on the other hand (the language I think sounds the fastest in general) is only about 70% as dense as English.</p>
<p>The speed of speech is not dictated by the number of syllables, but instead how quickly we think.</p>
<p>Therefore if it takes more syllables to express the same thought, we will just naturally pack more syllables into the same time frame.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at an audio spectrum of someone talking, the pauses between words and sentences don't exist to nearly the degree that you think they do. Talking is a fairly continuous sound, but your brain has learned how to break it up into words and insert much longer feeling pauses than actually exists.  When you don't really know how to segment the language, because you're just learning it, your brain has a much harder time splitting up the sounds into word boundaries, so you get a much more blurred together feel to the sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
