		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the contract with Disney for his work on Aladdin, Robin Williams obtained to include a clause giving him power to veto the use of his voice work in other production. It seems his goal then was to avoid being associated with lower quality spin-offs that might have come after the first film.   </p>
<p>In his will, Robin Williams stated that his work shall not be used for 25 years after his death. The purpose of this is to decrease the value of his estate in terms of projected income after his death in order to ease the estate tax burden on his family.   </p>
<p>Disney is still bound by the original Aladdin contract, needing approval from the Williams' estate before using his work. Disney is not directly bound by the will, but Williams' estate is, thus transferring the conditions of the will onto Disney. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This prevents Disney from using any of his outtake material (the stuff that didn't make it into the movies) for the duration of the will's legal binding, which is 25 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
