		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Understanding the different stages of a cold might shed some light on the process and answer your question:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 1-2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: This is the incubation stage (the time between catching an infection and symptoms appearing) there are no symptoms to tell you that you have contracted a cold virus.</p>
<p><strong>What's happening to your body?</strong></p>
<p>A strong sneeze can travel the length of a bus or tube carriage and you may have picked up your cold or flu inhaling infected droplets from someone else’s sneeze in this kind of environment.
The virus contained in those droplets has got past your body's first line of defence – the hairs and mucus in the nose, which traps them – or you have introduced them by touching your nose or eyes after being in contact with someone with a cold or flu.The virus is taking over your cells and using them to reproduce by the million.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 2-3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: : The first signs appear on day 2 and include tickle or soreness in the nose and/or throat and sometimes the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>What's happening to your body?</strong></p>
<p>Cells in the nose and throat release chemicals to defend you against the virus. These chemicals irritate the cells and cause itchiness and soreness and make you sneeze. By now a large number of cells have been killed off by the virus and the nose produces a watery mucus to wash them out. Killing off the virus takes a lot out of you, and you will feel tired and unwell.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 3-5</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: </p>
<p>The discharge from the nose may change from clear and watery to thicker and yellowish in colour. Your nose starts to feel very stuffy and blocked up, and you might get pain in the forehead and around and behind the eyes.</p>
<p>If the infection is a really nasty one adults may still have a slight fever.</p>
<p><strong>What's happening to your body?</strong></p>
<p>Catarrh is a mixture of mucus and white blood cells produced to fight off infections. It drips from the nasal passage into the throat causing a phlegmy, chesty cough as the body tries to get rid of the catarrh. The tissues in the windpipe also get congested, so that air passes through less easily and you could become wheezy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 5-14+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: </p>
<p>They usually start to subside but can last two weeks, sometimes a bit longer. Understanding this time frame, coupled with knowing what warning signs to look out for should stop unnecessary visits to your GP.</p>
<p><strong>What's happening to your body?</strong></p>
<p>The virus has been defeated. It is now just a matter of time until things get back to normal.  but it may be a couple of weeks until the symptoms have subsided. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The progression works kinda like this. You inhale the virus, it gets lodged in your nose let's say. It starts attacking and lysing cells, because that how it be. The body responds with inflammation and an increase in mucus production, which contains the active immune components. Your post nasal drip brings it down to your throat, which the virus then attacks and wreaks havoc. As luck would have it, a couple times when you breathe in you accidentally pull some of this post nasal drip / throat mucus into your lungs and voila, now you have an infection there. Since you usually swallow your post nasal drip, this can give you the vomiting and nausea component when your stomach fails to breakdown the viruses, which causes it to freak out and push the panic button, making you throw up. The change in symptoms from a stuffy nose to a runny nose is your body trying to fix it, and this leakage is what makes it mobile.</p>
<p>It can't attack systemically because it's not mobile enough. It's like living in a big city, if you don't have a means for transport you'll never leave the neighbourhood. For it to do that it would have to be in the blood stream, which is why when you get an attenuated vaccine you can get sick all at once. This isn't dangerous though because cold viruses target only the respiratory tract with a little bit of the digestive tract thrown in for free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comment talks a lot about this, but I wanted to clarify something I think is important. Give credit to  /u/APPRECIATINGME and /u/TheYearOfThe_Rat for their great points as well. </p>
<p>The term &quot;cold&quot; itself is the bigger problem. Advertising has turned a common phrase into a large misconception about respiratory and sinus related issues. There are several factors which cause cold-like symptoms, but the three main ones are infection, environmental, and dehydration. The infection is not curable through OTC medication, however those medicines are meant to treat the symptoms while your immune system deals with the rest of it. Environmental issues, such as changes in humidity levels, are the second biggest factor. Changes of seasons and rapid swings in humidity levels are a common cause for more mucous to be produced by the body, which allows for an increased chance of infection. In those humidity changes, it's important to stay hydrated as that will allow for easier mucous production and better allow your immune system to function properly.</p>
<p>As far as the actual question you asked, the symptoms of a cold are usually wrong about where they come from because of the first part. A lot of symptoms of a cold aren't from a specific virus, but more about the state your body is in. In that weakened state, you're more prone to infection which allows for the later symptoms. Another big part of the order of those is as you get infected your previous symptoms will be causing new ones on their own, such sore throat due to irritation from constant sinus drainage into your throat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
