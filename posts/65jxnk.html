It makes me feel at ease seeing it and it will often influence my decision making if the color blue is involved (like if i see a blue car even if i wouldn't like the car itself if it was white or any other color, I'll like the car because it's blue if its blue). I see blue before other colors when i look at things and i also quite dislike the colors red and green. Is there any psychological science/reasoning i guess behind finding certain colors attractive over others and even having decisions and/or emotions influenced by them?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to your own experiences (and corresponding emotional associations) with something, such as a color, the way a society attributes meaning to it also impacts our personal presences. In other words, people respond to, and in turn communicate, social cues when they declare their preferences for a color. </p>
<p>In the US, for instance, more people say blue is their favorite color (<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.livescience.com/34105-favorite-colors.html" target="_blank">one, of many, sources</a>). So, sometimes (maybe or maybe not in your case!) that subtly affects a person's individual preferences, e.g., to also like blue and convey a message of social belonging.</p>
<p>P.S., You may enjoy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-History-Color-Michel-Pastoureau/dp/0691090505" target="_blank">Blue: The History of a Color</a>, which describes the history of the color blue. It's a lot more involved than you'd expect! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The notion that our favorite colors are based solely on experiences is fairly naive. Looking <a href="http://www.livescience.com/34105-favorite-colors.html" target="_blank">here</a>, you can see that blue and green are by far the most popular. I bet this has to do with our instincts for food and water. There is nothing better than the feeling when you see an open field or ocean. You don't get the same feeling when you see a big brown/orange field w/ no grass or the yellow desert. I think it is just due to human nature wanting to live in green/blue areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
