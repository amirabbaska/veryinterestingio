		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains are more sensitive to changes in sound AMPLITUDE than pitch. &quot;White noise&quot; is basically sound which has all the same loudness, but lots of different and changing tones. We automatically filter out these noises because they generally represent a constant stimulus and therefore not an important change in our environment.</p>
<p>When someone is talking, the volume of their voice changes often, and there are spaces of silence in between. Someone speaking in a monotone is boring, because their voice does not change much in volume, although you can still understand the words they are saying. </p>
<p>With raindrops or ocean waves, there are small (or at least slow) changes in volume. With dripping water and snoring, there are bigger changes in volume. It goes from loud to silent and back again. For this reason, you can often help yourself fall asleep by &quot;drowning out&quot; these stimuli with white noise. Even though it's louder and has more types of sound, it fills in the little gaps of quietness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rain is a constant sound. You don’t hear the individual raindrops pinging from the roof, you hear all 9 billion or so of them at once. It’s like white noise - constant and soothing. </p>
<p>Snoring is an irregular pattern of snorting/snuffling/growling/gurgling. Unpleasant and grating on the nerves. Same thing with a leaky faucet - it’s a repetitive sound that grates on the nerves because our brains are wired to focus on repetitive sounds. It’s distracting and we can’t focus on anything else. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s the amygdala- the part of your brain that basically controls your alarm. So if a balloon gets popped behind your head, your amygdala reacts to it. There’s a disorder called misophonia that’s the hatred of sound. People with misophonia have an issue with their amygdala which make it react to sounds like sniffing, breathing, eating, certain letters of the alphabet and more. Basically, think about how infuriating pen clicking is or snoring is and then imagine that it’s like that for many normal sounds. That’s basically misophonia for you except it’s non-stop and constant, which is why it’s an issue. Your amygdala tries to determine what sounds could be dangerous and sets off your “alarm,” which is basically like a jump scare in a way.</p>
<p>TLDR; your amygdala messes with you and sets off your alarm for random sounds like snoring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
