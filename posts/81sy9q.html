		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if that's appropriate flair, but anyways. Usually potato chips are slightly saddle shaped, meaning they curve in opposite directions along the length and width of them (hyperbolic). Why don't they curve more like a sphere, in the same direction both ways (elliptic)? Why curve at all? I know it takes work to change the curvature of something, my understanding is that's why you can fold pizza to stop it from drooping. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Homemade potato chips are generally flat or wavy - they don't have a pronounced hyperbolic shape. Even commercial potato chips other than Pringles don't seem to have that shape generally - look at Lays. </p>
<p>And Pringles are not potato chips in any real sense - they're less than 50% potato, and are made from a sheet of dough deliberately molded into the shape. So I'm not sure that in general potato chips <em>are</em> hyperbolic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooh, I know this one.  At least in the case of Pringles, they are purposely shaped this way to act as an anti-airfoil on a high speed conveyor system during production.  The shape keeps them from flying all over the place when moving through the factory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could it be that this is a sociology/psychology question, and not a chemistry one? Perhaps it has to do with mouth-feel. Hyperbolic chips like Ruffles and Pringles have a shape which can curve over the tongue when placed in the mouth with a particular orientation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the spirit of your question is “why are chips, which are cut flat, end up with what looks like hyperbolic surfaces (like leafy greens can tend to grow)?”</p>
<p>I’m not a mathematician, but I think I understand the general ideas here and I can only point toward possible clues:
1) The deep frying process creates an even heat over the entire surface of the chip, but because of the geometry of that surface, the edges of the chip will heat up quicker than the center.
2) The starches in the potato have unique properties at different temperature ranges.</p>
<p>Given that, I think there may be uneven shrinking of the surface. Because the edges have more surface area, they probably get crispy first, but shrinkage is kept to a minimum by the still raw potato toward the center. As the inner portions heat and shrink more evenly, they might then pull on the outer edges, creating a hyperbolic surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
