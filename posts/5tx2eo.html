		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I was looking at what would happen as an object accelerated at a constant rate - say, 300 km/s^2.  From what it would appear from my math, the object would experience increasing levels of time dilation (from the perspective a stationary observer).  </p>
<p>A system of (relatively) stationary observers would watch the clock on this accelerating object, and would record slower and slower increments of time.  It looks like this would create an asymptote, or a point in time that the moving object will never reach.  So two questions:</p>
<p>1) Is my math correct here?  Will this object accelerating at 300 km/s ^2 approach a time that it will never actually reach in my frame? </p>
<p>2) If so, I'm having trouble interpreting the results.  In order for the stationary frame to not be &quot;special&quot;, the moving object needs to be able to potentially reach any time within its future... but doesn't this mean there is no corresponding X,Y,Z coordinate that this object will exist in when the clock passes the time I've calculated as the limit?  Wouldn't this mean that this moving object cannot exist in my universe at that time?  Either way, where the heck is it at that time?  </p>
<p>It seems like this would create a contradiction....    </p></div></div>
