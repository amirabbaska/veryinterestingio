He never spouts the usual hoax stuff about shadows and waving flags, but rather he is convinced we didn't possess powerful enough computing technology in 1969 to a) land on the moon,  b) launch back off of the moon and re-dock with the lunar orbiter, or c) land safely back on Earth.  One of his favorite arguments is, &quot;Have you been to Florida to see those pieces of junk? No way we got anywhere <em>near</em> the moon with that.&quot;</p>
<p>Problem is, I can't find a lot of specific de-bunking arguments discussing the computational power of the machines involved. How can I, in polite enough terms that I won't lose my job, and citing specifics, explain to him he's wrong?</p></div></div>

<p>Sadly though, for any conspiracy minded person who denies the reality of the moon landings, no amount of information will convince them to give up their deeply held beliefs. So you can pass this information along, but it will most likely be denied as fake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think you're both misunderstanding what computers are actually used for. Computers aren't magical devices that just make things like landing on the moon easy. Space travel isn't a matter of ordering a computer &quot;take me to the moon.&quot; The calculations required to compute a trajectory are really computationally very simple, and it's always been (and always will be) a matter of having intelligent humans know when and why to apply something.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/B3X48s9.jpg" target="_blank">This image of NASA engineers popped up recently.</a> The equations behind them are all from orbital mechanics, the basics of which were well understood for a long time. And relevant to your question, they are all trivial to calculate even with the computational power available in 1969 - you really don't need much more than a pocket calculator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you been to Florida to see those pieces of junk?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have, and they are goddam beautiful pieces of art. The fabrication of the rocket engines is simply astonishing.</p>
<p>Computers haven't exactly been the game-changing technology in large scale engineering projects that the unfamiliar might think they are. Large projects (like say the JSF) are more expensive than they ever were in the past, despite all of our computational resources. Look at other engineering tech of the era - the SR71 was designed in the early 60s using cigarettes and slide rules and is still the fastest air-breathing manned craft ever made.</p>
<p>edit: good lord people, 2 golds? I feel like I didn't even really answer the question!</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/programmer-s-toolbox/4008319/2/Calculating-trajectories-for-Apollo-program" target="_blank">a good read on actual details of how the trajectories were calculated, for those with a little background in orbital mechanics.</a> choice quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite their low performance, on paper, we got a lot of work out of those old machines. For those used to waiting 15 seconds for a Windows spreadsheet to even load, it's difficult to imagine how much work a 1-MHz computer can do when it's running full tilt in machine language, not encumbered by bloated software, interpreted languages, and a GUI interface. I'm old enough to remember, and look back on those days wistfully.</p>

<p>And you kerbal fanatics need to realize it's not as realistic as you think ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well for one thing a large rocket was certainly launched, and NASA published the trajectories so people could independently track the craft, which the Russians did. And just from that alone we can know that something went to the moon and therefore clearly the calculations had been done. </p>
<p>The part that makes the moon landing obviously true in my mind is just the fact that the big expensive bit is the rocket itself, if you can launch that much mass and reach the moon the only thing stopping you from sending people is the size of their balls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not too long before the famous Apollo missions, NASA were still doing calculations by hand.  They calculated the trajectory of John Glenn's flight by hand.  They only started using computers to do calculation in 1962, and continued to employ teams to double-check the computer's calculations.  It is my belief that they double-checked most or all of the computer's calculations by hand.</p>
<p>One such person in charge of this was Katherine Johnson, a mathematician and physicist.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson</a></p>
<p>She calculated the trajectory for the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1962, when NASA used computers for the first time to calculate John Glenn's orbit around Earth, officials called on her to verify the computer's numbers. Ms. Johnson later worked directly with real computers. Her ability and reputation for accuracy helped to establish confidence in the new technology. She calculated the trajectory for the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon. Later in her career, she worked on the Space Shuttle program, the Earth Resources Satellite, and on plans for a mission to Mars.</p>
