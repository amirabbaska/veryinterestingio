		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual opera singer here.</p>
<p>The same reason why anyone gains weight when they are in a high-stress job that requires a lot of travel. It's a stressful job with intense hours during production periods, and it gets really easy to neglect exercise and just eat crappy foods, especially because you usually celebrate after performances with your friends/colleagues/family. You often don't get a lot of sleep, and that can also mess with your overall health.</p>
<p>As far as actual singing goes, there's actually no evidence that being overweight makes your voice bigger, lets you sing louder/over an orchestra, or anything like that at all. If anything, vocal scientists are finding that being in better physical shape actually IMPROVES vocal stamina and quality, just as being in shape improves performance in any physical activity.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, being fat has some &quot;advantages&quot; when learning to sing classically. Some of the most common phrases to singers is that they need &quot;to be grounded,&quot; &quot;sing from their diaphragm&quot;, &quot;have low-breath,&quot; etc. When you're carrying around a lot of extra belly weight, you have a constant tugging-down feeling. You have extra weight physically pulling the breath mechanism downwards. It can help in learning to sing.</p>
<p>Also, until recently, it didn't matter if you were fat and unhealthy. If you had a god-like voice, you could look however you want and still perform and get good work. Opera used to be (and, IMO, SHOULD still be) about the voice and music over anything else.</p>
<p>Now that there is a big push for opera singers to LOOK like the roles they play (nobody wants to see a 300 lb Juliet anymore), many professional singers have taken to losing weight in unhealthy, crash diets. They lose weight so quickly, they are unable to feel the changes that happen in their body and take time to make proper adjustments. They no longer feel &quot;grounded&quot; because they don't have the weight actually &quot;grounding&quot; them. So their technique suffers, their voice gets &quot;lighter&quot;, they have an existential crisis, say they can only sing when at a certain weight, and eat themselves into oblivion again.</p>
<p>Those who lose weight responsibly and healthily rarely, if ever, have any problems singing.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR It's a big, mental game. Some singers think they can only sing at a certain weight and size, and actively try to stay large.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, no one really knows for sure why, but there are a few theories. Opera singing requires extensive use of the diaphragm. Some theories suggest that the singers' bodies undergo changes over time due to this (such as expanded ribs). Another theory suggests that a larger mass (mouth, lungs, chest, really everything) helps project the voice over the orchestration. This seems to be backed up by the singers who insist that when their weight fluctuates, their voices suffer. For singers, in general, it's a propagated cautionary tale that weight loss surgery ruins the voice. Additionally, opera houses currently think that slimmer singers will heighten the interest in opera (here's looking at you, Patricia Petibon). However, the opera houses often insist that it is very difficult to find slim people who have powerful voices.
But on a totally different note, a lot of studies show that a larger body mass doesn't necessarily mean that the voice resonates better. So, a lot of people now say that stomach fat must help pull on the diaphragm and thus helps support the voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just a fun story to add to the discussion. I can't offer any scientific evidence. Only an anecdote told to my by my opera singer professor back in group voice. </p>
<p>She said that different bodies sometimes just produce different qualities of sound. She talked of a very large opera singer who had a large voice with &quot;girth&quot; to it. She said her voice had this immense warmth and depth to it that utterly entranced audiences. But due to health issues she absolutely had to lose weight. When she dropped a significant amount of weight, her voice's timbre seemed to have changed from deep and warm to somewhat brighter.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a hormonal change that caused this. Being healthier might have balanced out her hormones and maybe taken some pressure off her throat and various core muscles and organs. She was by no means any less talented, nor was her voice any less beautiful and graceful. However it had shifted in its previous qualities.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that finding an ideal weight for oneself is most important. Breath control and health don't just spring from nowhere. You must be healthy to sing well and for long periods of time, and must practice all the time. And health is probably definitely most important nowadays.</p>
<p>Perhaps being an abundant opera singer was a sign of decadence and wealth and maturity? Who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>At 30 years old, your only at the very beginning of your career. A succesfull pop singer can be 17 and thin as a stringbean. Not in opera. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the primary reason but just an interesting thought, what if it has to do with the opera culture that makes you gain weight? After parties, hours spent signing(not excersizing the body), etc. Maybe being in the opera makes you fat, not being fat makes you good at the opera</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
