<p>But some effort is put into blocking access such as posters of banned people being at the ticket booth or gate, and they use facial recognition programs with surveillance systems in some parks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't necessarily able to catch every person who was supposedly banned. However if a banned person causes trouble in the future then when they come to the attention of the park and are recognized as having been previously banned they can be charged with criminal trespassing. This is often enough to discourage their return.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being banned means you got caught making trouble.  There is a pretty good chance you will get caught again if you make the same sort of trouble, and this time you will be charged with criminal trespass.</p>
<p>What if you sneak in and don't make trouble?  That's pretty much all those establishments want, so it isn't going to that big of a deal to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They generally don't. They just tell you that you are banned to discourage you from coming back. You think you're banned, so you're less likely to go back. There is no reliable method of actually stopping you from coming back.</p>
<p>If they <em>really</em> don't want you to come back, they could put your picture up somewhere, but that's not reliable and is rarely used.</p>
<p>There is an argument to be made that getting banned makes any future entry trespassing. However, this would be negated for any venue that required you to purchase a ticket because the act of selling you a ticket would be giving you permission to enter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
