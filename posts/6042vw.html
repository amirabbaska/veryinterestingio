		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: this is a move by Erdogan to consolidate power. </p>
<p>There are 18 proposed changes, including one to remove the Prime Ministerial office, and another to increase the number of MPs.  Ultimately it gives Erdogan more power.  </p>
<p>Questions have been raised about separation of church and state, democratic freedoms and judicial processes. </p>
<p>It appears that the conservative government supporters want the bill to pass. There are claims of intimidation and suppression of those against the changes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Erdogan is reversing Turkey's secular culture left over from the 1900s, when the predecessor to Turkey, the Ottoman Empire was dissolved. Due to increasing influence by religious fundamentalist minorities, he feels empowered to systematically dismantle first the military, then the courts, then the remaining legal obstacles that would stop his religious backers from maintaining power.</p>
<p>Since he has largely succeeded in these acts, he has now managed to reach the most basic layer of the civilian legal system in Turkey - its constitution. To legitimize his actions and ensure that there cannot be a legal counter-revolution against him and his religious fundamentalist backers, he is rewriting chunks of the constitution to effectively outlaw his opposition or actions they would wish to take to under mine him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different amendments being voted on by the general public. some good, some complicated and some downright terrible. The good and complicated ones are however only there for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The whole thing boils down to a power grab by Turkey's current president Tayyip Erdogan, in essence he is trying to make the role of president significantly more powerful by taking power away from other branches of government and giving it to the President(himself). </p>
<p>These changes are purportedly in response to last years failed coup. They are generally supported by the ruling AKP party and opposed by everyone else. The AKP says they are needed to fight terrorism and future coup attempts.</p>
<p>Now a little history. Turkey has a long history of coups, but a little different to what you may expect. Coups in Turkey are generally carried out by the military when the government tries to subvert democracy and in general becomes too tyrannical. So these coups are generally carried out to preserve democracy and secularism. This is odd to say the least if you know anything about coups.</p>
<p>TL;DR Over the past few years Erdogan and the AKP have become increasingly authoritarian. There was a failed coup attempt in 2016, this has been used as further justification to crack down on civil liberties, free speech and the press. There is a constitutional referendum planned with the general aim of giving the president more power in 2017.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
