		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nose is actually a pretty awesome organ that helps make sure that the air you breathe is prepared as good as possible for your lungs.</p>
<p>That includes amongst other things filtering particles out of the air (This pesky nose-hair is actually good for things!), making sure the air  gets warmed up when it is cold and moisturizing the air if it is dry. Clean, moist and warm air is making sure that it's easy on the lungs and your breathing is efficient. Additionally breathing through your nose makes sure your air intake is regulated and you aren't prone to hyperventilating.</p>
<p>So that explains why breathing in through your nose while doing sports, meditation and... basically in every situation is the best way to breathe in, but why is breathing out through your mouth then advised in sports?</p>
<p>It's mostly about the speed of your oxygen intake. Or, to be more precise, about increasing the breathing frequency. As I just wrote the flow through your nose is rather limited. That works in both directions, if you breathe in as hard as you can and breathe out as hard as you can first through your nose then through your mouth you will see that you can breathe a lot faster through your mouth. So if you breathe out of your mouth you will save a little time which means that your intake frequency of oxygen will, overall, be higher.</p>
<p>TL:DR: Breathing in through your nose is easier on your lungs and more efficient, breathing out through your mouth has little drawbacks and is faster. Together it's the most efficient you can breathe if you need higher levels of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICU nurse, here. Your question is very good. It has multiple levels for an answer.</p>
<p>Your sinuses in your nose are filters for air including temp, debris, bacteria, etc. They prep air best for your lungs, medically.  It is also slower at pulling in air. Aesthetically, this swirling action also creates a cooler, refreshing feel to the air you're breathing. It calms you and creates a sense of well being. </p>
<p>Exhaling from your mouth dumps air very quickly and uncerimoniously. It is very efficient, creating an emptying action for stale air in the lungs that tends to stick around if you're breathing in too much or too often. You'll note that if you're using this method to breathe in, that cannot be achieved. Also, breathing in through the mouth is associated with a stressed breathing. </p>
<p>Basically, you have an optimal breath ratio that is served best by slow inhale rapid exhale. And breathing in with your mouth is something that you generally only do in times of great stress. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason, biologically and neurologically is because breathing in quickly through the nose, and out slowly through the mouth (which can regulate the speed of the exhale with the lips and tongue), stimulates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve" target="_blank">Vagus Nerve</a>, which regulates breathing and the digestive system, as well as hear rate and other things. When you breathe out slowly, the Vagus Nerve is stimulated to release endorphines and serotonin, which relax the body and slow the heart rate. This works during meditation, exercise, and helps with the symptoms of anxiety in the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breathing in is primarily for oxygen intake, while exhaling is to get rid of carbon dioxide and other minor toxins. The bloodstream can only intake so much oxygen depending on pH levels of blood. Some misconceptions occur when people try to breathe in and out for the same beats. Nose breathing inherently should have longer intakes than breaths out.</p>
<p>Imagine a fridge full of boxed meals, you can't get rid of the boxes till you've completed the respective meals. Mouth breathing is like trying to stock the fridge for five meals daily while only eating three. Eventually, you run out of room to put the new meals, and then some unneeded problems occur. Nasal breathing is buying groceries for the week and eating them through the week. Correction can and should be made when needed, and adjusted. Though the mouth breathing could work, it's not as efficient, and can cause some unhealthy habits/problems.</p>
<p>Some other benefits of breathing through the nose include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filtration of air through nasal passage immune responses</li>
<li>Acclimation of the air when in various climates</li>
<li>Reduced rate of dehydration</li>
