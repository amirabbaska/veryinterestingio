		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games are expensive to make, taking lots of time and money. Good games take more time and money. In the mobile gaming world, I make more money when more people download my game, and I lose money in making the game. Stealing intellectual property from other people and well-recognized brands kills an entire flock of birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Now I can get lots of people to download my game because of the brand recognition. I don't have to waste my time and/or money developing assets on my own. I don't need to spend lots of time hoping for my brand to get big. I can just sit back while the money rolls in.</p>
<p>On the other side of the house, we have the people who made these brands or assets. They can come after me if they want to stop me from using their work for my benefit, but it costs money to do this. If they are a huge operation and I'm one person, it's probably going to cost them more money to take me down than for them to just ignore me.</p>
<p>I'm also not the only one stealing from them. They have tons of little leeches like me doing the same thing. It isn't worth their time to go after all of us, so they focus on the biggest and most egregious ones until it stops being worthwhile.</p>
<p>If they do come after me, so what? I take that one app down and put up another one ripping off someone else and carry on my merry way. Rinse and repeat if necessary. If they manage to take my entire company down, I'll just open another business and do the same thing again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, there isn't much regulation in mobile apps, especially on the Google Play store. Even more so when the apps originate in countries with loose intellectual property laws (like China)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without having an example, I can only really speculate, but it usually comes down to two things:</p>
<p>1) The mobile game is too small for the copyright holder to notice/care about going after.</p>
<p>2) The mobile game is already licensing the copyright material.</p>
<p>EDIT: /u/Rpgwaiter deserves credit for this, but the point of countries with loose/non-existant IP laws (with China being an infamous example) is another big point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well kinda depends which games. There are actually assembly kits for games now that will run off similar templates and wouldn't be copywriting each other since were developed with the same game kit. So many of the 'city/town' builders come from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
