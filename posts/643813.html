		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Urine comes from the bladder, basically a hollow ball with a thin layer of muscle in the walls. That muscle smoothly contracting, plus or minus gravity, makes urine exit through the urethra in a single stream.
<a href="https://www.memrise.com/s3_proxy/?f=uploads/mems/3080451000150429114144.jpeg" target="_blank">https://www.memrise.com/s3_proxy/?f=uploads/mems/3080451000150429114144.jpeg</a></p>
<p>Ejaculation, on the other hand, involves forceful rhythmic contractions. The vas deferens, the tube that carries semen, is wrapped with a ridiculous amount of smooth muscle. Cross-section:(<a href="https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1299736/286495313/stock-photo-cross-section-of-the-vas-deferens-tissue-in-the-microscopic-view-286495313.jpg" target="_blank">https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1299736/286495313/stock-photo-cross-section-of-the-vas-deferens-tissue-in-the-microscopic-view-286495313.jpg</a>) </p>
<p>This is further assisted by the bulbospongiosus muscle at the base of the penis, and the pubococcygeus muscle in the pelvis. </p>
<p>EDIT: It's been a few years since I've had to use this knowledge. The bulbospongiosus and pubococcygeus drive all the forceful emission; the vas deferens slowly propels sperm to its waiting place in advance of ejaculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that it's been found that each of the spurts of semen has a slightly different chemical makeup. The earlier ones are more acidic, the later ones more alkaline, and the middle ones closer to PH neutral. </p>
<p>It's been hypothesized that this pattern helps the earlier semen to kill any semen left over in the vagina from a previous sexual partner, whereas the later ones serve as protection from a potential later partner's acidic sperm. The middle ones are the most viable.</p>
<p>This has been cited as evidence that humans evolved to have multiple sexual partners at the same time. </p>
<p>I got this all from the wonderful book Sex At Dawn, which I highly recommend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since other users have commented on the mechanism, I'll comment on the &quot;advantage&quot; part.  Evolutionarily speaking, we can't say for certain whether or not ejaculating in bursts rather than a stream confers any advantages over any other given mechanism- we can only be sure that it wasn't a big enough <em>disadvantage</em> to our ancestors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A human ejaculation typically consists of anywhere from three to nine spurts. Researches who somehow managed to capture “split ejaculates” for analysis found that the first spurts contain chemicals that protect against various kinds of chemical attack (they protect the sperm from the chemicals in the later spurts of men’s ejaculate). These final spurts contain a spermicidal substance that slows the advance of any latecomers. In other words, competing sperm from other men seems to be anticipated in the chemistry of men’s semen, both in the early spurts (protective) and in the later spurts (attacking).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one's addressing the evolutionary heritage of the human male penis (the human female penis will not be discussed here). </p>
<p>People always conflate the function of evolution with some motive. There is no thought process. If there were, then we'd all be walking around with great, hulking eleven inch dongs. Luckily for me, many other men do not.</p>
<p>Evolution simply says that the passage of genes is bound to the rules of statistics. Over some number of generations (n), a different number of loads will be delivered (n^l ). Of those, a different number of successful loads will be delivered (n^L ), which will lead to successful initiation of cell division within the female. </p>
<p>All traits that lead to an increase in n^L will accumulate, while those that lead to an increase in n^l may or may not. One trait that leads to an increased n^L could be a grisly, vascularized, girthy eleven inch dong. Another may be more fully developed set of cum shooting muscles. Another is very most certainly a dominating, mushroomed glans (which serves to physically scoop the cum from the last dudes load out, thus rendering his cum shooting strength irrelevant).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
