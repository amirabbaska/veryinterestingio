		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. When replicated, they have two chromatids (and four branches) just like every other chromosome in your cells. Because two of the branches are very short, they can lie next to each other, creating the appearance of a Y under a microscope. However this is a coincidence! The name &quot;Y&quot; was chosen because it follows X, which was originally thought to be the sex-determining chromosome.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Y chromosome was identified as a sex-determining chromosome by Nettie Stevens at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 during a study of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor. Edmund Beecher Wilson independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by Hermann Henking. She realized that the previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome &quot;Y&quot; simply to follow on from Henking's &quot;X&quot; alphabetically.</p>
<p>The idea that the Y chromosome was named after its similarity in appearance to the letter &quot;Y&quot; is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well-defined shape during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during mitosis, has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.</p>
