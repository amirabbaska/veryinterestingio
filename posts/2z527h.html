		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> During full moons it would be about 8x brighter.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> The <em>albedo</em> of a body determines how much light it reflects. For the moon, that number is about 0.1, meaning that it reflects about 10% of the light. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=c-v7OSaxGSsC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=albedo+aluminium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XUXTa7N79d&amp;sig=ms8D3mnC-ey6PjbtM7fPIfshSiQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AcMFVZbyF_eCsQS0yIGwAQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=albedo%20aluminium&amp;f=false" target="_blank">This book</a> has a nice table of albedos for various building materials, including &quot;bright aluminum foil,&quot; which it lists an albedo of 0.8, or 80%. </p>
<p>Therefore, the moon now reflects 8x more light. Depending on the moon phase, we'll receive variable amounts of light on the earth. For reference, I want to show your some numbers for the luminous flux (or lux) or various light sources. Although this sounds like what a mad scientist might call his death ray, I assure you this just means how much light we get on a given area. </p>
<p>Anyway: </p>
<pre><code>Cloudly, moonless night: 0.0001 lux
Full moon: 0.27–1.0 lux
Twilight: 3.4 lux
Full moon (with aluminum foil): 2.2-8.0 lux
Dim Office Building Hallway: 80 lux
Sunrise/Sunset: 400 lux
Direct sunlight: 32000–100000 lux</code></pre>
<p>So you'll easily be able to see at night provided there is moonlight. Since the full moon is now considerably brighter than twilight, I'd suspect the sky would take on more of a navy blue color and that we'd have fewer stars visible in the night sky. The Milky Way is already quite hard to see when there is moonlight, and with a foiled-moon it will be a sight reserved for the few moonless nights each month. </p>
<p>Even the light from a crescent moon covered in aluminum foil is brighter than a full moon without one. Fun fact: you can actually see the dark part of the crescent moon even without aluminum wrapping. Even though the dark part is not receiving direct sunlight, it's being illuminated by sunlight reflected from the earth (in much the same way the earths get a little bit of light from the moon). This is called <a href="http://www.mattastro.com/gallery/earthshine_07may08.jpg" target="_blank">earth shine</a>, and would be easily resolvable at night, and it might even be possible to see it during the day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that the surface of the moon right now is a combination of a retroreflector (like a stop sign), a rough Lambertian-like surface (like chalk) and a rather crappy mirror. If you took away the retroreflection and Lambertian parts, the shape that the moon makes during its phases would change dramatically because it would only reflect light at a very specific angle relative to the light source (rather than diffusing the light in all directions and reflecting a large portion back towards the light source, as it does now).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/VeryLittle's answer is probably the most numerically accurate you're going to get, but I'd like to clarify a few things.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the moon itself <em>is</em> highly reflective. The issue is that it reflects light in many different directions, and not directly back to us. This is because regolith is a rough, heterogeneous material that ultimately causes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection" target="_blank">diffuse reflection</a>. In this sense, energy is still being conserved - it's just that only a portion of it is reflecting <em>back towards us</em>.</p>
<p>Highly reflective in the sense that you mean typically means that the material generates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection" target="_blank">specular reflection</a> - that is, that instead of scattering light in all different directions, the distribution of light is much closer to the ideal angle of reflection.</p>
<p>For the moon this means that, yes, when you actually can see the reflection it could be thought of as approximately 8x brighter (assuming that the surface albedo of 0.8 is including the specular reflection as well - this is a common simplification of lighting models used in that area). The problem is that as you move away from ideal the angle of reflection the light will attenuate quickly. The math gets <a href="http://www.heldermann-verlag.de/jgg/jgg01_05/jgg0312.pdf" target="_blank">a bit crazy</a>, but we call the phenomenon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_highlight" target="_blank">specular highlights</a> because they only appear on the surface where the angle of incidence, surface normal, and scattering of light coincide such that light is reflecting back to you.</p>
<p>A great visualization of this can be found at <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdfGWf" target="_blank">this shadertoy</a> - you can click and drag the light around to get a good idea of how the position of the light in relation to the camera affects how much is reflected back to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is about where my ability to answer breaks down: to model it correctly (while conserving energy) requires the use of multiple reflectance models and an understanding of the material properties of the surface of the moon that I simply don't have. In practical terms, objects tend to have a mix of both specular and diffuse reflections, and even these wind up being approximation of effects such as sub-surface scattering that may further change how it would appear.</p>
<p>THAT SAID. Someone did a visualization of what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8I25H3bnNw" target="_blank">the moon would look like if it was a giant disco ball</a> that I believe is probably a pretty decent approximation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My back of the envelope maths says to try this experimentally would only take 115 years. Ignoring the pesky transport problem.</p>
<p>Aluminium is 2,720 kg/m^3. Lets make that easier to read one metric tonne is 0.36764705882 m^3. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> household aluminium foil is 0.016 mm (0.00016 m) thick, so let us divide by that to see how many square meters of foil we can make with a metric tonne. That comes out as 2297.79411762 m^2 per metric tonne. <a href="http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/" target="_blank">world-aluminium.org</a> states we produced 53057000 metric tonnes of aluminium in 2014. So that would cover 121914062499 m^2. <a href="http://www.space.com/18135-how-big-is-the-moon.html" target="_blank">space.com</a> says the moon has a surface area of 38 million square kilometers. 3.8*10^7 km^2 / 121914062499 m^2 = 114.835047657. So lets say a nice 115. Only a little longer than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment" target="_blank">pitch drop experiment</a>.</p>
