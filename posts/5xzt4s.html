		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you need to be careful with phrases like &quot;a small amount&quot;. </p>
<p>Mars is around 225 million km away at <del>closest approach</del> average distance.  Lets say you have a 1W flashlight and aim it at Mars, the intensity very far away from this flashlight will drop off as the distance squared (also a little extra from absorption and scattering in the atmosphere).  Without doing any exact calculations, if we assume scattering is negligible we can say the intensity that hits Mars will be larger than</p>
<p>I &gt; 1W / (2 pi * (225 million km)^2) ~ 3 × 10^-24 W /m^2</p>
<p>Mars has a surface area of 144.8 million km², so the power hitting Mars will be around</p>
<p>I * A/4 ~ 2.3 × 10^-10 W</p>
<p>This isn't a lot of power, but a single photon at optical wavelengths has an energy of around 3 × 10^-19 J, so this is still billions of photons a second hitting Mars.  </p>
<p>Edit: Lots of people are pointing out the beam divergence and scattering I ignored. Scattering I still don't think is very significant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">about a fraction 10^−5 of the light will be scattered for every meter of travel</a>, most of earths atmosphere is within 20 km of the surface so the intensity is reduced by a factor of around</p>
<p>I/I_0 = exp(-20000*10^-5) ~ 0.8</p>
<p>which is a 20% loss and thus not significant.  If you aimed the beam through more atmosphere or if you had a blue flashlight this gets worse, but never significant.</p>
<p>The beam divergence depends heavily on how wide a flashlight you have to start with, if you had something which is quite compact the divergence is worse than something with a large output.  Most of the power is actually in a spherical segment which is, say, 30 degrees in size, where as my calculation assumed this was closer to 90 degrees.  To compensate the intensity on Mars would be bigger by a factor of  (90/30)^2 = 9 ~ 10.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider this:  The <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/pressrelease2.html" target="_blank">Voyager spacecraft</a>, out there on the very edge of the heliosphere, is broadcasting with a 20W transmitter (a third of a regular light bulb's output).  The amount of signal that reaches Earth (and is still recoverable!) is about 1/80,000,000,000^th the amount of power supplied by a digital watch battery!</p>
<p>So, yeah, Mars is practically right next door.   Your photons will get there.</p>
<p>Edit: Precision of language.  Also, adjusted figures based on the fact that the report is almost 20 years old.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a clear night and a perfect aim, over time, yes, some of the photons your flashlight sends will be on the perfect vector and will impact its surface. The longer you hold it on target, and the more accurate your flashlight is, the greater the number of individual photons will collide with it.</p>
<p>But that VERY VERY small amount of the light that will be scattered widely over its surface and you wouldn't really be able to measure it.</p>
<p>If you reverse the situation and look at what light Mars is sending us, when we see it in the night sky it's a fairly small dot, not too bright. That light is reflected sunlight coming from the <em>entire surface</em> of the planet - about 21,300 square kilometers or 8200 square miles if you look at Mars as a flat plate.</p>
<p>Compare that to a somewhat brighter almost-point-source from someone standing on its surface and aiming a flashlight (maybe 10 square inches or 44 square centimeters) in your direction. It might be brighter but it's 3 <em>trillion</em> times smaller in area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Standing on Mars facing the point of origination, would you be able at all to see the light? Is there a way to see a beam of light from earth?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
