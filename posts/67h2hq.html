		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we do know is that current hunter-gatherers who haven't been influenced much by outsiders tend to live in highly egalitarian societies, mostly regardless of geographic location and ancestry. Resources are shared, work is playful and collaborative, and any attempt to increase authority or status is immediately fought with ridicule. It seems reasonable to think this is close to what our ancestors' social groups would have looked like. </p>
<p>By contrast, chimpanzees, our closest primate relatives, have a strict &quot;alpha-male&quot; organization.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primitive humans, or the genus <em>Homo</em>, first appear in the fossil record approximately 2-2.2 million years ago. Their brain size was still small, though, similar to relative apes. What distinguished these early humans is the evolution of the first metatarsal, the first metacarpal, the gluteus maximus muscle, oblique muscles, pectoralis major muscle, and the ball-and-socket joint in the shoulder. These adaptations allowed for elite throwing, subsequently making primitive humans power scavengers. Evidence of such throwing is drawn from the discovery of rock or manuport clusters made by <em>Homo naledi</em> circa 1-2 million years ago.</p>
<p>In accordance with the social coercion theory, primitive humans evolved elite throwing abilities first, which prompted successful cooperative group hunting of larger prey; consequently, communication and larger brain size were a result. Thusly, early humans banded together, and if one human was a liar (cheating or stealing) or did not contribute to the group, he/she/it would be outcast by the rest of the group. In turn, that human was significantly more likely to die, as well as fail to reproduce.</p>
<p>To answer your question, no, primitive human groups did not have leaders. These primitive human groups followed prey, and cooperative hunting was the primary goal of the group. Essentially, it was “monkey see, monkey do.” It wasn’t until the appearance of <em>Homo sapiens</em> with significantly increased cranial volume that social structure and hierarchy started to take shape, which didn’t occur until about 500,000-700,000 years ago when humans and Neanderthals diverged from the common ancestor <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>.</p>
<p>Speculation and debate of Neanderthal behavior is inconclusive and not much is concrete or certain about their social behavior. From the fossil record, however, their bones do provide insight. Evolving separately from humans over a few hundred thousand years, Neanderthals developed marginally larger brains than humans but the shape of the brain divergently evolved. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that Neanderthals inhabited Eurasia, while modern humans (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) thrived throughout Africa. Compared to humans, Neanderthals lived in smaller groups, generally less than 10 individuals. Neanderthals were, however, capable of communication, evident in the similar evolution of the hyoid bone and the larynx, but it is predicted that Neanderthal speech was less developed human verbal communication.</p>
<p>Human groups did not have leaders until finally the development of coercive weapons such as the bow, atlatl, body armor, spears, and swords. As such, the leader of a group was typically the best or most fit warrior. Men became warriors in order to protect their women and their facility to reproduce. This caused a dichotomy in social structure, dividing men and women. Of the men, the best warrior usually lived longer and as a result had more life experience. Mosaics of Alexander the Great and marble statues of Caesar depict these two leaders as elite warriors brandishing coercive weapons in order to appeal to the self-interest of himself and his fellow warriors. Brutal, public force was used to keep the rest of the group in line.  From the historical record, Ancient Rome had the coliseum and Ancient Meso-Americans like the Incas and Aztecs had graphic public beheadings and executions.
I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main source of data for the Neolithical time, which is the closest data we have on that as far as I know, is  Murdock's (1967) Ethnographic Atlas. It offers lots of data about societies just before the first point of contact with Europeans, several of them still at Neolithical stage. You can see there that even the simplest societies had two hierarchical levels at least. This means that they did not only have one chief, but some kind of overchief above the chiefs. However, there were several societies without any hierarchy beyond the local community, meaning no states or similar.
Concerning the question about the origin of political organization, in the field of economic history there has been recently a lot of discussion around an article using Murdock's Atlas and concluding that it was the geographical potential of growing crops what caused the emergence of more complex societies. Here you can read an understandable summary of the original paper:
