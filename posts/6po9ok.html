		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really fall asleep so much as we fade asleep, and scientifically speaking, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where wakefulness ends and sleep begins. The process of sleep starts before you're in bed, even. As you get towards the end of the day or your usual sleep time, your body temperature starts to drop, hormone levels change to get your body ready for sleep, you start to feel a bit drowsy. When you get into bed, your brain starts to take in less and less external information and your brain activity slows, shifting from active and awake beta and gamma waves to slower alpha wave to even slower theta waves. Heart rate and breathing rate slows but your muscles are still somewhat active. This is considered the first stage of sleep, NREM 1. What's interesting is that if you woke someone up in NREM 1 sleep, they may not recognize that they were asleep. In the next stage, NREM 2, you would see theta brain waves with sleep spindles and K-complexes. Your muscle activity drop and you are nearing the point where you are unaware of the outside world. This is the point where someone would be considered fully asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So what we're learning now is that there really isn't one particular off switch that occurs. Many conditions must be met before we successfully drift off. Levels of melatonin, adenosine and cortisol appear to all have major influence, and are controlled by both our circadian rhythm and external sensory info.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sleep-wake cycle is complex, and is regulated by multiple neurological circuits and neurochemicals. Serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine, noradrenaline, and hypocretin maintain the waking state. The onset of sleep is controlled by the sleep drive, which steadily increases while you are awake, as well as circadian rhythm fluctuations. As for actually falling asleep, sleep-promoting neurons in the anterior hypothalamus release the neurotransmitter GABA and inhibit the wake-promoting regions in the hypothalamus and brainstem, generating slow wave sleep (SWS). During REM sleep, regions in the brainstem typically inhibited while awake or SWS become active. The now active cholinergic neurons in the brainstem activate the thalamus which in turn increases the firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex; dreams result. Finally, sleep-promoting substances that accumulate in the brain while awake gradually increase the sleep drive by stimulating sleep-promoting neurons (Murillo-Rodriguez, Et al., 2009). How these sleep-promoting substances are accumulated and destroyed is also complex, involving feedback loops of transcription factors and other proteins, endogenous chemicals and signaling cascades that act at the genetic and cellular level. This transcriptional regulation pathway is thought to be responsible for circadian rhythm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy to think we're unconscious when we're asleep. We could be living a completely different life and not even know it then we wake up. The idea goes way deep. The dreams we have then wake up. What if it's another world we live in. There is a lot to sleep and dreams that's very interesting. I'm surprised more people don't question it more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
