		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three reasons: first, the prosecutor has to decide whether or not to charge a crime. Many prosecutors are reluctant to charge crimes against cops because they need cops on their side to prove a case. You get a cop who is pissed off at you? Suddenly he “can’t remember” the drug case you’re prosecuting, or isn’t available to testify, and you lose your case. There is immense pressure to play nice, and that means looking the other way. </p>
<p>Second, officers are often immune from being punished for their actions. That’s because the question isn’t “what would a reasonable person do under X circumstances,” it’s “what would a reasonable OFFICER do?” This is how they are not convicted of homicide under circumstances that arguably show straight-up execution; they are held to a different standard than civilians. </p>
<p>Third, and related: nearly every crime requires an intent element. To show evidence tampering, you’d have to prove a criminal intent - something that is difficult to do if you’re not able to prove the underlying wrong. </p>
<p>This is my first time replying to ELI5, so I hope I did okay :) </p>

<p>Police have to have the ability to turn the cams off while on break...going to the bathroom or when theres simply no need. Not to mention the logistics. The city cant record 11 hours ( length of a typical officer shift) straight of video for ever officer, thats crazy expensive to retain in a lot of states if not flat out impossible. You would need a google level server for a mid city city especially since some states require retention for decades, a lifetime or forever. They way most dash cams and body cams work, is they are always technically on, but when activated they record 15 minutes or prior to being activated and continue to record.</p>
<p>Edit: turning off a cam during an incident may be a violation of policy and thus subject an officer to discipline but might not be destructive of evidence because its failure to produce evidence rather than destruction since didnt exist then was destroyed. Plus you first have to prove a crime occurred first. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does a &quot;public defender&quot; not answer the Q asked but rather speculates on intent?</p>
<p>To tamper with evidence requires the evidence <em>exist</em>. If no video is taken, there is no evidence to tamper. </p>
<p>Second, those cameras aren't on all the time for many very justifiable reasons. Anything they record can and should be public record. <strong>Unedited</strong>. Think about that next time you use the bathroom or console a CPS case. Since they go on and off, you cannot dictate when they go on. It can be a policy but not a law as that requires clairvoyance. </p>
<p>I speculate the &quot;public defender&quot; didn't discuss these as the tactic he would use is to exploit them to get his client off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why can't <em>you</em> be arrested for not taking a picture of every single thing you do?</p>
<p>Remember: the law is the same for police officers as everyone else in this regard.</p>
<p>The answer is that failure to create evidence is not the same thing as destroying evidence.</p>
<p>Body cameras <em>have</em> to be possible to turn off for a variety of privacy reasons, including but not limited to going into bathrooms and similar places. And remember: they're not the only people <em>in</em> those bathrooms, either, and everything from body cams is potentially in the public record.</p>
<p>On top of that, storing vast amounts of video (8+ hours/day) is simply unwieldy; if you have 50 cops, that's 4000 hours of video per day. Beyond the sheer amount of data storage that would require, it would also be impossible to manage; you'd be constantly losing data in the sheer volume of crap, and it would be impossible to ever review in a timely fashion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
