		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are citing good numberss but missing the important info that makes those numbers matter. </p>
<p>The peak plasma concentration of THC, meaning the most your blood can physically hold at once, is 100-200ng/ml. This is when your blood is saturated and can not absorb any more THC (Think about trying to dissolve salt. Eventually you can't dissolve any more because the solution is saturated.). This is also way below what we think a lethal dose would be for a human.</p>
<p>This means there is a limit to how high you can get. Now you can still keep smoking pot, but you'd be wasting it, and to be honest most people never get anywhere close because why would you want to. But so when people say &quot;You'd need to smoke the equivalent of Xkg an hour&quot; the important thing they are missing is that that is chemically impossible. Your body can not absorb THC fast enough to kill you. <strong>THAT</strong> is why it's impossible to overdose. </p>
<p>If you did something to damage your kidneys or whatever so that you couldn't filter it out, and your tissues kept absorbing it because you literally were smoking tonnes per hour for weeks, then it's possible it could accumulate to a dangerous level, but really that would be the kidney failure and realistically you'd die of anoxia first. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bluntly put, the median lethal dose (LD50) of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) is so high and the methods of intake so dilute that you would have to do absolutely impossible feats to have it occur.  While there are a couple of different and conflicting sources, one estimate placed it at 40,000 times as much as the dose needed to get high.  This is contrasted with alcohol, where five to ten times the amounted needed to get you drunk can kill you.  To extrapolate, With pot brownies you'd die of sugar poisoning long before the THC got you.  With smoking, you'd have to smoke something like 1,500 pounds of weed in a period of 15 minutes.</p>
<p>To actually manage a THC overdose you'd have to spend a lot of effort to first purify a sizable quantity of THC and then ingest it rapidly.  This would never happen accidentally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Virtually everyone in this thread is confusing &quot;overdose&quot; with &quot;lethal overdose&quot;. </p>
<p>You absolutely can overdose on THC/marijuana. If you have too much, you're gonna experience negative symptoms that outweigh positive effects. Typically this is called &quot;greening out&quot;, and it simply means you've smoked too much grass.</p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term drug overdose (or simply overdose or OD) describes the ingestion or application of a drug or other substance<strong> in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you green out, you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Temporary feelings of paranoia/fear/anxiety</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Rapid heart rate</li>
<li>Trembling/feeling very cold</li>
<li>Disorientation</li>
<li>Hangover</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Overdose&quot; does not necessarily cause death. In the case of drugs such as heroin, overdose is often deadly, but sometimes it is not. There's a prevalent attitude in weed culture that insists that &quot;weed overdose is not possible&quot;, and that smoking massive quantities is somehow a way to show how cool you are, when this is clearly not a good practice for your health. Of course, when you have a high tolerance to THC, the amount you'd need to overdose is much larger than if it were your first time smoking.</p>
<p>TLDR: The process of smoking more and getting a better high does not continue ad infinitum. There's a point where you'll stop enjoying it, and that's an overdose, or &quot;too large a dose&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no CB receptors in parts of the brain controlling respiration: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032740/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032740/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because cannabinoid receptors, unlike opioid receptors, are not located in the brainstem areas controlling respiration, lethal overdoses from Cannabis and cannabinoids do not occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also read that excessive Cannabinoids down-regulate CB receptor activity, a sort of natural overdose protection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someone uses a great deal of cannabis daily, it will actually down regulate the receptor. In other words the body tries to prevent excesses of activity and it will do that by inactivating the receptor if there’s too much activity.</p>
