		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What most people think of as cutting off their circulation is actually compression of the nerves which innervate that area (typically a limb). The blood supply is generally not compromised at all, it takes quite a while (hours) for ischaemia to present with neurological signs (tingling etc).</p>
<p>The compression of the nerves causes abnormal discharging of the the sensory neurones which is in turn perceived as tingling (parasthesia) or other abnormal sensations. This is usually reversible but if the nerve is compressed for a long time it can persist or become permanent.  You can look up Saturday Night Syndrome if you are interested.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and a missed “signs”</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments, my apologies if I don’t reply to them all.</p>
<p>I perhaps should have been slightly clearer in my language as some have rightly pointed out that direct compression of nerves leads to changes in the microvascular supply to that region of the nerve and this is implicated in the development of symptoms. I more meant my above comment to convey the fact that it is the compression of the nerve itself (and subsequent microvascular and other sequalae) not the arteries supplying a limb which leads to the parasthesia many people experience. </p>
<p>This is worth a quick read if you are interested but is by no means exhaustive: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12371026/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12371026/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, when a nerve is crushed, suppressed, destroyed it stops eliciting action potentials correctly. Action potentials are signals that cells of the nervous system create to send messages to other cells, tissues, organs, etc. in the body. Everything you feel, temp, pain, pressure is interpreted by your brain. When the action potentials that carry the temp, pain, pressure are interrupted by a suppressed or damaged nerve then the brain interprets it as you describe, a tingly sensation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
