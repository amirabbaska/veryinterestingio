		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, paint absorbs light, so you shine a white light on red paint and it'll absorb everything out of the white but the red. You mix a lot of paint and it'll absorb almost everything out of the white, now there's a lot of different type of paint so you most likely won't get a black end result, but a brownish one. </p>
<p>When you add all the colors of the rainbow, that's light itself, not an absorption, and white light is just what you get when you add all the colors that your eye can see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Subtractive vs additive light. Paint absorbs all light but the color they emit (red paint absorbs all light but red), light emits only the color (red light emits red light). When you mix two lights, you mix the wavelengths, when you mix paints you are combining what colors they absorb, mixing more colors means they absorb more colors, leading the color they emit to turn very brown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bonus answer: What do you mean by &quot;greater wavelengths&quot;? Red has the longest wavelength, blue is much shorter, violet is the shortest. Purple has no wavelength. It is a mixture of colors. Most colors you see are a mixture even if they have a dominant wavelength. Only lasers have a single color. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To get white light, you shine red, green and blue light at the same time, each at their maximum intensity. Greys arise when equal amounts of each colour is shone, but at a lesser intensity than the white. </p>
<p>Browns, tans and khakis arise when all three primary colours are emitted, but in different amounts. For instance, your average brown will need some blue light, a bit more green light, and a majority of red light shining to create it. Note that the (small amount of) blue mixed with an equal amount of green and red would create a dark grey, and the rest of the green mixed with red would create an orange. So you can think of brown light as being created by adding grey and orange.</p>
<p>If we imagine each paint as absorbing all wavelengths but one (obviously not true, but the principle remains the same), adding lots of paints would result in most wavelengths being absorbed, but a few - one from each paint - would be reflected. These wavelengths come from all over the spectrum. If they were all of the same intensity, and evenly spaced through the colour spectrum, we'd see it as grey. However it's much more likely that certain colours would appear more prominently than others, meaning that it would appear brown rather than grey.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: White is all colours at their maximum intensity. Brown is all colours, but at a low intensity, and with more red than green or blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
