		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several main classes of anti depressants.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) - Prozac, Zoloft etc </li>
<li>SNRIs (Serotonin Norepinepherine Reuptake Inhibitors) - Pristiq etc</li>
<li>NDRI (Norepinepherine Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor) - Wellbutrin</li>
<li>Tricyclics and tetracyclics - Pamelor, Vivactil etc</li>
<li>MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors).</li>
</ul>
<p>They can all potentially affect sexual function.  But SSRIs are consistently the worst.</p>
<p>The mechanism affecting sexual function is the same as what makes the drug work on depression.  By increasing the serotonin (the calm happy hormone), dopamine can be reduced in the brain.  It's dopamine which leads to arousal.</p>
<p>NDRI meds (Wellbutrin's pretty much it) taken in combination with SSRIs can assist with the issue.</p>
<p>MAOIs are generally the best at having no negative affect to libido.  However these medications have fallen out of favour due to tyramine intolerance.  Basically, any aged protein (think salami, cheeses etc) has the potential to cause a hypertensive crisis - to the point it can be life threatening. </p>
<p>I take Parnate (MAOI) and have for many years.  I'm lucky and don't have an adverse reaction to tyramine.</p>
<p>That said, MAOIs remain the most effective antidepressents and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) medications on the market.  A bit like taking a sledgehammer to a nut.</p>
<p>NOTE - THIS IS A LAY DISCUSSION FROM EXPERIENCE I AM NEITHER  DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major function of antidepressants is to inhibit the reuptake of neurotransmitters. Consequently, some of those neurotransmitters happen to act on the sympathetic nervous system, which is the fight/flight section of your unconscious self, versus the parasympathetic which is rest...digest...repair...reproduce. </p>
<p>When you have a lot of norepinephrine, the major sympathetic hormone, it can sort of leave you on edge, which puts you in a specific state of mind where you're not &quot;comfortable&quot; with reproductive activities for the most part, unless your sexual mood happens to be one where its positively influenced by a fight/flight response, such as exhibitionism, rough sex, etc. </p>
<p>Your libido depends a lot on your individual sexual preferences, some people prefer sex to be tame, others like it to be rough. Anecdotally, SNRI's happen to make me prefer it rough the majority of the time, otherwise I don't really like it at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prozac comes from a class of drugs called SSRI. It stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. Sounds fancy, I know. Serotonin is a chemical that can be found in your body and is pretty important to your life and health as it regulates many things including your mood, sleep, digestion, memory, and sexual arousal.</p>
<p>When Serotonin is released in the body, it can restrict blood vessels. This is important because of the way the penis becomes erect. The penis during erection needs blood flow. If you have more serotonin in your body as a SSRI would do, it would be harder (don’t mind the pun) for your penis to become erect because it is not able to get as much blood flow. This causes the erection problem. </p>
<p>This is part of the problem. Serotonin also keeps you calm by interacting with your brain. It does this largely due to the chemical properties it has. Some people might experience less excitement during sex or other things due to the calming effects of serotonin which would cause problems for one’s libido.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. To be honest, it’s a pretty common problem.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten a lot of answers, but I thought I would add my understanding as someone who has taken these drugs. Serotonin isn't a happy feel good drug. It's a cap to mood swings. For instance, after orgasm, serotonin floods the brain and keeps you from achieving another orgasm immediately. It's what puts you to sleep after sex. I don't know why people refer to it as the happy neurotransmitter. I believe it's actually a mood stabilizer. Most transmitters work in opposition. So, take GABA which is basically a transmitter that acts like alcohol that chills you out and dumbs down your alertness. This is counteracted by acetycholine which is basically the same as coffee. It provides alertness. Your body fights to keep these in balance. When you abuse alcohol, your body tries to keep up by over producing alertness chemicals like acetycholine. When you go cold turkey, your hands shake because you've ripped away the previous levels of a chill out drug, but your brain is still producing coffee at previous levels. Well, if you take serotonin reuptakes inhibitors, you are actually providing something that keeps these swings from happening. If you are a person with anxiety, serotonin keeps you from being too anxious. If you are a person with depression, it keeps you from being too low. It basically acts as a cap to these fluctuations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
