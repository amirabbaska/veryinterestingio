		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hacking, fundamentally, is to force a system to operate outside of its intended parameters. Even if the term is most widely used for breaking into someone else's computer system, using the term in non-malicious and benign situations is perfectly valid.</p>
<p>When talking about computer security, using the term &quot;hacking&quot; as described above, can be seen as forcing a system that's intended to be secure to behave outside of intended parameters as well. That would mean it's no longer a secure system. The system has been compromised. </p>
<p>To &quot;hack&quot; a computer system involves (among other things) writing code that specifically targets vulnerabilities in the system's software or hardware. By exposing a system to a situation it isn't capable of handling, you can cause the system to partially break down and start doing things it shouldn't be doing. </p>
<p>&quot;All&quot; software is designed to handle a lot of unintended situations. A program that adds together two numbers and stores the result in a space that can only hold 3 digits might have code that makes it double-check that the result isn't 4 or more digits before it tries to write it, for example. If it gets a result that ends up bigger than 3 digits, it'll stop before doing something illegal.</p>
<p>When a hacker tries to attack a system, they try to find the errors that a program <em>doesn't</em> know how to handle properly, and then cause it to perform an action that causes this error. Then they attempt to cause this error to change things in the system that allow for even greater changes, hopefully a change that would allow them to gain full control of the system.</p>
<p>When a &quot;patch&quot; comes out for a program, this may be the creator of the program changing the problem that the hacker found. After the patch is applied, the hacker now needs to look for a different weakness in the program, which the creator of the program again will have to fix with a new patch. As you can see, this is basically an arms race. More and more sophisticated attacks being launched at more and more robust software.</p>
<p>As for what's used, sometimes, it's analyzing traffic coming in and out of a system, looking for patterns or anomalities. Other times, it can be going through a program's source code, attemting to find portions of code that would be vulnerable. The &quot;hacks&quot; themselves are often performed with an array of viruses, malware, etc. that is sent to a system. These are written with text editors that are optimized for coding or with software engineering tools similar or the same as what &quot;nice&quot; coders use.</p>
<p>Then there is also social engineering, which is isn't as much hacking a computer system, as it is to trick the users of it. If you can fool a user into giving you their password, you don't need to attack their system directly with malware or viruses. This is what often is the case when someone on social media says they've &quot;been hacked&quot;. Usually, they've been lead to believe they were using the real website of a service when they entered their login information, while they in reality were not. Once they've done this, criminals can often figure out the username and passwords for other sites this person uses, because a <em>lot</em> of users reuse passwords across sites and apps.</p>
<p>Social engineering is often used in conjunction with more technical attacks. If you can trick an employee into giving you their login info, you can use this to plant malware that wouldn't have been able to penetrate a company's network from the outside. However, if the malware was planted <em>inside</em> the company's network instead, by a compromised employee's account, it could work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>DefCon is a hacker convention (most of them work for security firms and are trying to improve security, and to do so, have to find the vulnerabilities).</p>
<p>This specific talk, the speaker is trying to find a way to highjack the control of a hobbiest drone from his annoying neighbor-kid who keeps bothering him with his drone. It includes stealing control of the drone from the person holding the remote, interfering with it's control systems, GPS, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You would be surprised how much of hacking looks like this.</p>
<p>Then they can also trick user to run program with malware on his computer. I.e. Click here to install this awesome emoji pack.</p>
<p>And then there is brute force attacking. Loads of servers try one character combination after another trying to login to a system until one of them works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have a system that manages user accounts, one feature of this system is changing user passwords..</p>
<p>As a user, I simply say &quot;My name is xxxx and I want to change my password to xxxxx&quot;, the system will then perform this action for you.</p>
<p>Now, a hacker would see this is a window to exploit the system, and could try &quot;My name is yyyyy (a different user) and I want to change my password to xxxxx&quot;, if the system doesn't validate the request from the user and notice that the user is actually changing someone else's password then there is a problem with said system.</p>
<p>A hacker is someone proficient at finding these exploits, hacking is actually using exploits to make a system do things that it was not originally intended to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical walk through of hacking a system:</p>
<p>1) Research</p>
<p>Before a hacker hits a system. They research the crap out of it. Every detail they can uncover about the system, they will. Programs like NMAP are used to identify the system and possible Internet programs they are running. It can tell you what versions of what server services (server programs) are running like Apache v2 on port 80, as well as Operating System details, etc. This information is used to identify a vulnerability and how the exploit code should work.</p>
<p>2) Build an Exploit</p>
<p>For the most part, companies don't update their software, or at least all of it. So after Step 1, the hacker has probably found some vulnerable software running. Maybe they have a script that takes the output of NMAP and compares the results with a local database of exploits that is built from online sources. Voila, there is a match. The target system is running an old version of Apache that has a remote code execution flaw. Doesn't even require much of an exploit since it's vulnerable by simply manipulating the headers of a HTTP request. A practical solution is to have the exploit setup a backdoor for remote management (ssh tunnel, vnc, whatever). The skilled hacker may take advantage of the kernel (operating system's engine) to hide the backdoor somewhere so it doesn't show up in &quot;system processes&quot; or any &quot;task manager&quot; (like in Windows).</p>
<p>3) Send/Run Exploit</p>
<p>Send the exploit. Initiate the attack. Sit back and watch it work. Most typical hacks occur in milli-seconds, after latency is resolved. Complex hacks can take minutes, but for the most part, a hacker will do what they can to minimize the time in and out of a target system.</p>
<p>If you are interested in playing with some tools, check out NMAP, Wireshark, Reaver, maybe even Cain and Abel. If you are interested in learning how to exploit systems like a pro, I recommend studying low level programming like Assembly. If you master low level mechanics of computing, you will have keen insight on how to manipulate other systems. Cheers!</p>
