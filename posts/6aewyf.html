I'm also not sure about the rights situation, Youtube might stake a claim in the news station's video if they upload it there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When using embedded Youtube videos they are not able to easily control ads (it is possible to layer in a video prior to the video but then Youtube may also serve an ad prior to the video).</p>
<p>Also, by controlling the video player/ads shown, they can change the length of the adspace. This is huge because they can charge different rates for videos on the Homepage versus one on a deeper page as well as different prices for longer ads vs shorter ads.</p>
<p>Finally, as another person already said, Youtube is not the best to be able to track analytics. So by using other video players they are usually able to better gauge the demographics of viewers (further enabling them to sell more specific advertising space to partners).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you seen what's happening with YouTube and demonetization?  That wouldn't affect what you're talking about, but it's a good example of why you shouldn't always just use someone else's platform if you can provide your own.  Their video players might not be as good, but it means they don't have to rely on YouTube at all.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Control of ad inventory, and being able to sell ads directly. It is all ad value. YouTube not only splits the revenue of all the ads sold, the CPM is less. A dedicated gaming website might be able to sell directly to a game publishing company and guarantee the viewing audience will be people interested in buying games. YouTube is also pretty well ad-blocked and that makes each view less valuable, while proprietary websites are always trying different creative ways to get around that, or baking in ads. </p>
<p>It might seem like a small difference, but 10k views on that shitty player might be more valuable than 100k YouTube views, and revenue drives almost all decisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money. The news stations can choose how many and what ads to play before, during or after the clip, and don't have to share the revenue with YouTube. They also don't have to deal with the Youtube TOS which may forbid even the slightest nudity, which is usually no big deal in most European countries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
