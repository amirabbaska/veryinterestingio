		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most animal models of cancer use mice without an immune system, and they just inject some cancer cells from a flask into the mouse. </p>
<p>Different cancer cells sometimes spread to different parts of the body (e.g. Lung cancer cells spreading to the lungs) and some just form a tumour at the site of injection.</p>
<p>Other animal models can use a chemical that causes cancer to induce tumours.</p>
<p>Source- PhD student in a cancer research lab </p>
<p>Edit- because the mice don't have an immune system, they don't try to get rid of the cancer, because those cells will be foreign to the mouse, the same as bacterial cells that our immune system can attack</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tumor cells are grown in a dish and injected into the rodent. Different types of tumors grow in different injection sites (and grow better in certain places or in specific strains of animals etc). For example, breast cancer cells can grow into a tumor in several places but tend to grow well in the mammary fat pad of female rodents. You can also model metastases by injecting your tumor cells intravenously- they will hit the lungs on their way around, and will settle/grow there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One method is implanting tissue directly from a patient. </p>
<p>Once a patient signs a consent form, a portion of the tumor is brought to the research lab. Immune-compromised mice/rats are knocked out using anesthetic, an incision is made, and a small piece of the tumor is implanted in the animal just under the skin. When it grows to a large enough size, the tumor is extracted, spilt into many pieces, and implanted in many more mice (or frozen for later use, or collected for analysis, etc.). This is repeated to maintain stocks of mice with the desired tumor type, some of which are then used for studies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides injection of cells, there are genetic models. For breast cancer, there are a couple different extremely well known lines of mice that are extremely predisposed to tumors.
For liver cancer, there is a chemical you can inject into baby mice that predisposes them to tumors later in life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did some research on melanoma using mice this summer, I can help answer this! </p>
<p>My specific project was actually perfecting the method of giving mice cancer to use them as models for cancer treatments. </p>
<p>Basically, we order cancer cells from a company that has made a consistent, pure cell line. We feed the cells a nutrient-rich cell food and let them multiply on a plate, then inject the cells right into the mouse and let them do their cancer thing. For our purposes, we injected the mice in the ear since it has a nice supply of blood and the mice couldn't mess with the growing tumors too much (they tend to scratch/gnaw at them because tumors smell weird to mice).  </p>
<p>You can also use a &quot;seed&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; mouse, where you do the same process as above, let the tumor get freakin' huge, euthanize the mouse, cut out the tumor, then mash it into a tumor smoothie and inject THAT into another mouse. This supposedly works better as the cells are adapted to living mice already, but don't quote me on that. </p>
<p>Since our project was about measuring immune responses, our mice had fully functioning immune systems. This means that half the time the mice actually resisted the cancer, which was a bummer for our study but good for the mice I guess lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
