		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading a lot of things that make me chuckle, so I'm going to set a few things straight.</p>
<p><strong>Retail banking generates massive profit</strong></p>
<p>Banks do like personal customers, personal loans, general insurance, life insurance and home loans generate a good amount of profit. Small businesses are barely worth running a branch for and although the corporate banking clients need a place to send their staff for deposits and change in shopping centers... your branch generates close to 0 profit off of this. </p>
<p><strong>Closing a branch takes a while</strong></p>
<p>People have already mentioned this, but even now, closing and balancing a branch can take a lot of time. A lot of the time you have too much or too little money and this is bad, so you stay back for hours trying to find out what happened.</p>
<p><strong>New ways to do banking means its not always necessary</strong></p>
<p>Phone and internet banking can do pretty much everything the branch can do. You can get money out at ATMs and you can organize bank cheques over the phone. Most of the people that come into branches these days are literally unaware they didn't have to, or too stubborn to learn how to do whatever they wanted themselves.</p>
<p><strong>For a lot of branches, you would just end up getting lonely</strong></p>
<p>Some times you just wouldn't get enough people in the branch to warrant keeping it open. Bankers are costly, even bank tellers earn a pretty good deal more than other entry level positions. You need to have multiple people on to run a branch because of security reasons and different roles needing different levels of training... it would just be a stupid business decision when you pay that much to serve 3 customers.</p>
<p>Just going to repeat it though because it makes me laugh that people don't think banks care about personal banking... Loans and insurance make banks a lot of money. Sure one corporate deal for a few million is great money, but there are plenty more people than there are corporations and people want loans and need to insure their goods... this stuff adds up. Its a market that would be silly to ignore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in banking operations management for 4 years collectively. It is a retail banking decision to cater to business accounts. Most businesses operate during those peak hours and the target banking consumer are the businesses owners who have the freedom to leave WHILE their businesses are in operation. (I wish that was a joke but it's true)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual target customers of banks are not individuals, but businesses. Businesses have far more cash to deal with than you do, and it typically isn't worth their time to stay open for your transactions during the weekdays. The banks are open when businesses are open and making deposits, which only makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be a teller at a bank, I'd say that about 80 percent of our customers were business owners. The rest were just old people who still actually went to the bank. I'd say that since most people nowadays use direct deposit and that atm's are open 24/7, there isn't really any need for them to stay open later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something not mentioned yet: the classic 'bankers hours' are to a certain extent a holdover from the not-so-long-ago days when most of their record keeping and such was done manually on paper. Updating ledgers at the end up the day to ensure all the balances are correct takes a fair bit of time, and is necessary to prevent Mrs. Johnson from coming in and withdrawing the last $100 in her account two days in a row. And think of the record keeping required for banks with multiple branches... Everyone's ledger needs to be up to date and agree with everyone else's. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
