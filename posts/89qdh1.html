<p>EDIT: Maybe it's just because I usually frequent less popular subs, but lol my inbox is overflowing. Thanks for all the info!</p></div></div>

Don't underestimate the power and speed of a big snake. Think of it this way, a big snake means it's good at being a snake. He's about that snake life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It means snakes can go a month+ without a meal. They don't need to catch something every day, so they can afford to be patient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's a couple pics I snapped in Costa Rica a couple years ago. </p>
<p>As you can see - there is a bit of a trail which is commonly used by small animals as they rummage around through the jungle. </p>
<p>The snake basically just crawls up to the edge of the trail and waits... </p>
<p>This particular guy had been sitting there for quite some time, possibly days - based on some of the fallen tree matter that was on top of other parts of its body. In this shot the snake is fairly straight - so we are not exactly targets at that point - otherwise it would be in the shape of an &quot;S&quot; to allow for some amount of a strike. </p>
<p>These snakes basically wait - like a landmine - for something to walk within range... and then they snap. Their teeth are rear-facing - so once the bite - pulling away doesn't exactly work as the teeth break the flesh and then hold on in one direction. Quickly after the snake has made its initially strike it will try to weight down its prey and wrap around any limbs in order to take the battle to the ground and then the snake will continue to try and wrap as it rolls, still maintaining a firm grasp with its mouth. Eventually - the snake will begin to squeeze - and with every exhalation - the lung capacity is tapered, slowly limiting the animals ability to inhale and take in new air. </p>
<p>These snakes are incredibly powerful - but slow moving right up until they make that hail-mary strike. </p>
<p>It's crazy to think about the metabolics involved here - as a snake goes from barely moving for sometimes a week at a time - to wrestling down a wild mammal with limbs trying to flee for its life. Zero to 60 in terms of calories used...</p>
<p>Edit: my mistake - constriction kills by cutting blood supply, not limiting lung capacity and thus respiration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are very fast over a short burst and very, very strong, so ambush is their best method of catching prey. You'll see videos of large pythons (like anacondas) hiding in waterholes and the like, waiting for an animal to take a drink, so it can use its strength and speed to catch said animal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to remember with snakes, especially large ones, is that they are muscle. An anaconda may look fat, but that is muscle. Imagine if you walked, swam, climbed, killed, swallowed, and performed all other activity with the same muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
