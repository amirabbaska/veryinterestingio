<p>The &quot;is it good or bad&quot; comes down to whether you're a proponent of net neutrality or not. If you are, it was the best result possible at this point. If you aren't, this was the worst possible result at this stage.</p>
<p>So, here's the short and neutral version:</p>
<p>Broadband ISPs (the companies which own the actual DSL, cable, and fiber lines which bring the Internet to you, like Comcast or Centurylink) would really like to be able to offer tiered services and prioritize content from certain sites. For example, they'd like to say &quot;we'll charge $90/month for 50 megabits and access to every site, but if you want 50 megabits and only want to use Facebook and YouTube, we'll offer that plan.&quot;</p>
<p>Very much like how cable television works.</p>
<p>They would also like to be able to take extra money from YouTube to give priority to data from YouTube to consumers, which naturally means data from some other video site would be slower to be transmitted.</p>
<p>The FCC is not a big fan of this, and enacted a rule basically saying &quot;you're a utility and can't treat some data different from other data.&quot; Kind of like how the water company can't decide it's more important to give water to the wealthier neighborhoods.</p>
<p>ISPs filed suit, essentially arguing that the FCC does not have the power under existing laws to classify them as a utility or subject them to rules demanding they engage in the same neutrality required of the companies which owned the phone lines with regards to their use for Internet access.</p>
<p>What does this hinge on?</p>
<p>Well, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and that's the law that gives the FCC <em>any</em> power in this area. And the ISPs contend that the language of the statute and intent to mirror then-existing FCC rules indicates Congress intended to distinguish broadband from telecommunications. The FCC disagrees.</p>
<p>The D.C Circuit agreed with the FCC.</p>
<p>So, what does it mean going forward? For the time being the FCC's rule is enforceable. <em>But</em> (and this is important) that could be changed by the FCC itself (a new administration, for example), the Supreme Court, <em>or</em> Congress.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for the replies, I'm trying to get to all of them.  And, of course, thanks to the people who have given me gold for this.</p>
<p>Also my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4o9391/eli5_what_does_the_courts_recent_decision/d4b6x20" target="_blank">ELI3</a> which may help explain the broader concept of net neutrality and the lack thereof using a highway analogy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just want to link directly to <a href="http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/04/25/this-hilarious-graph-of-netflix-speeds-shows-the-importance-of-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">this graph</a> of internet access speed to Netflix servers during negotiations with Comcast.  It's embedded in the Oatmeal link mentioned elsewhere, but I want to draw attention to it.</p>
<p>Comcast went to Netflix and basically demanded that they pay a premium for Netflix users to access their servers (to stream from Netflix).  It's been noted elsewhere in the comments that services like Netflix already pay more for their internet, mostly just because of the volume they have to handle.  But Comcast wanted Netflix to pay an additional fee, because <em>reasons</em>.  Netflix initially refused, citing that they were already paying the agreed fees and the appropriate amount, and also because what Comcast was doing was literally extortion.  And then, <em>for some mysterious reason</em>, Comcast customers found themselves having difficulty streaming from Netflix.  Those customers got frustrated with Netflix, so Netflix caved and renegotiated their fees to Comcast, and then <em>very mysteriously</em> their access speeds went back up again.</p>
<p>Net neutrality makes events like that illegal.  An ISP can negotiate their contract, but it has to be based on the actual fair cost of providing that service, and they can't jack up the price just because their subsidiary service competes with whoever is using their internet service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
