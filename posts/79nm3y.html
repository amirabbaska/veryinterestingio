		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a running joke in our family that &quot;we only make boys&quot;.</p>
<p>My father was one of 8 brothers. he himself had 3 sons (2 different marriages) his middle son has 2 sons (again 2 different partners) and is expecting a 3rd son in the next few months. nobody else in our family has kids yet.... now based on the fact we are taught all the way through schools that the boy girl chance is about 50/50, that makes the chance of my family's male child run of 14 children in the region of 1/16400... i.e pretty unlikely</p>
<p>Obviously we could just be incredibly Lucky/Unlucky (delete as appropriate) but i'm curious to know if there is anything that makes people more predisposed to creating male or female offspring? </p>
<p>edit: seems like there isn't much in the way of conclusive evidence that people are genetically predisposed to have one gender. just down to luck of the draw for the most part.... apologies to the mods for a topic that seems to thrive off anecdotal evidence and speculation. looks like you've been kept busy.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are mutations, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragenomic_conflict#Segregation_distortion" target="_blank">sex ratio distorters</a>, that cause an organism (and all of its descendants) to only have children of one particular gender. If I remember correctly there are a few <del>species</del> breeding populations of mice that managed to get themselves extinct that way (Edit: this might not be accurate, see below). </p>
<p>I don't know if this is possible in humans though. And even if it is, it seems more likely that your family just happened to get 14 boys in a row. 1 in 16348 sounds like a lot, but it really isn't that unlikely in the grand scheme of things (how many families are there on the planet?).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth considering that the different sperm cells have different physical tolerances, which can be environmentally driven.</p>
<p>I can't find the study(ies) right now, but I remember reading truck drivers tending towards daughters, along with pilots, radar operators, etc. The thinking was along the lines of y chromosome sperm being more easily killed by radar, stress, injury, and heat.</p>
<p>It seems to follow that boys could be driven by exposure to cold, but again I don't have any studies to hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome" target="_blank">androgen insensitivity syndrome</a> for example can cause those affected to appear female, regardless of XX or XY.  This would throw off the boy/girl ratio for those families.  However, they don't properly develop female internal reproductive organs, so they don't have periods and can't have children.  </p>
<p>Given that the odds are only 1/16400 and there are probably more families than that in the population, it's not unusual for there to be families out there that are as skewed as yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
