It's possible that the wrong person was arrested and there is supposedly a presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Also, wouldn't it just create a mob mentality and skew public judgment from a jury perspective?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may sound strange, but it's actually done that way to protect people from the government. You may have heard of secret police in other countries throughout history 'disappearing' people in the night, or arresting them and keeping them locked up for years without trial. The US strives to avoid this by making arrest records and courtroom proceedings open to the general public with very, very rare exceptions. This essentially allows the public to audit the government - check why someone was arrested, check that they're not held without trial, check that the trial was fair, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I want to address some of the common replies I've received.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's not a foolproof system. I don't know of any system that has zero flaws. But by having the rules in the first place, it makes it that much more likely that someone along the line won't break them or will report it. It takes a lot of people and money to run secret prisons, to transport people there, to cover up missing persons reports, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's meant to protect you from the government. Most of the abuses of it are coming from private companies or individuals, particularly in the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I think it's a good system, there's nothing saying it's the only system or the best system. But just because you find flaws doesn't mean the entire thing is useless. It means that when weighed against the flaws of other systems, we had decided this one had the best trade-offs.</p>
</li>
<li>As with most systems, there's nothing saying it can't or shouldn't ever be changed. However, we should make sure we understand why it exists in the first place before we look to tearing it down, if only to fully understand the trade-offs that may be made by adopting a different system. </li>
