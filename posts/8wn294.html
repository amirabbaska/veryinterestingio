		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the book “The Collapsing Universe” by Isaac Asimov, he claims that degenerate matter would behave like a gas. He explains that while the electrons are compressed into a free flowing goo, the nuclei still remain relatively spaced out, and would thus act like a gas. Given that this book was written in the early ‘70s, is this an accurate statement, or do we have a better understanding of degenerate matter?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is basically yes, but it depends on your point of view. It's hard to imagine the kinds of forces involved that would cause the material to flow. Under such forces, normal matter wouldn't stand a chance.</p>
<p>Note the compared to the confinement  pressure required to create EDM, the forces of molecular bonds in ordinary materials are of no consequence. </p>
<p>Under such forces and pressures, things like tungsten or diamond behave more like gases themselves. In fact the density of EDM's are believed to be on the order of 10,000,000 g/cc. If you fired a small pellet of EDM at a tungsten block, the EDM would hardely flinch, and might as well be passing through a rarefied gas for the difference in density. The tungsten wouldn't have a problem flowing out of the way, then then consequently destroying itself in the process.</p>
<p>So EDM's are extremely <strong>hard.</strong></p>
<p>This is if course assuming a small pellet of EDM would be stable, which it  wouldn't be.</p>
<p>EDM is incredibly dense and at least from the perspective of the properties of normal matter, extremely hot. It isn't stable by itself, but exists because the immense gravity of a stellar remnant (a white dwarf) keeps it confined. If you took a small sample of EDM out of  the confinement of a white dwarf, it would explode in a spectacular fashion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do work simulating neutron stars, which are composed of neutron degenerate matter, but the same concepts apply to electron degenerate matter.  It's best to say that matter under these conditions acts as a fluid, something that in physics terms encompasses both gasses and liquids. All this means for the most part is that the material can easily flow under applied forces and isn't locked into one specific shape.</p>
<p>The extreme conditions of degenerate matter in compact stellar remnants aren't required to see this sort of effect though. If you look at the phase diagram of any material you can see that the distinction between the gas and liquid phases eventually ends as pressure and temperature increase and the material simply becomes a fluid that isn't really gas or liquid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In modern helioseismology, at least, neutron stars are modeled as a solid crust surrounding a superfluid core. The crust is treated mostly like an elastic solid, with added considerations for general relativity. The superfluid core is more complicated; superfluids are basically zero-viscosity fluid (i.e., they have no internal friction) that are also able to support transverse wave modes, which normally are only found in solids.</p>
<p>So it's a free-flowing goo that behaves elastically like a solid and is bounded by a rigid solid shell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
