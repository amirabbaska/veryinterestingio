		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that a lot of these other posts don't mention is that, in the 1980s, Tony Hawk's father, Frank Hawk, founded the National Skateboarding Association which provided a series of contests to promote skating every year. And Tony Hawk was one of most dominant contest pros of all time. I can recall Transworld repeatedly referring to him as 'The Michael Jordan of Skateboarding.'</p>
<p>Also, he was on the most popular skate team throughout the 80s, Powell-Peralta, that invented the concept of a skate video. And Hawk's parts were legendary. Bones Brigade Video Show and Animal Chin both helped get Tony Hawk's skating into people's living rooms early on. And long before he landed the first 900, he landed the first 720--a trick that only a handful of skaters could land, much less in competition. </p>
<p>Then he founded Birdhouse, one of the most popular skate brands of the 90s and made himself a household name all over again by winning the X-Games broadcast into people's homes year after year. People love watching winners, even if the sport isn't usually popular. How many cyclists could your average American name when Lance Armstrong was winning the Tour de France every year? Or how many swimmers other than Phelps and Lochte? </p>
<p>And so finally, with his career of contest wins on some of the most popular teams of multiple eras, with tricks nobody else could match, and with a fairly clean public image as a skateboarding goodwill ambassador (in no small part to Frank Hawk's involvement,) Hawk was approached by Activision about a series of skateboarding video games with his name on it. Those games reached demographics that would never touch a skateboard in real life and Hawk's name was front and center. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Must have been 1988 or so. My best friend Sean and I were HUGE Tony Hawk fans, and skateboarding was really taking off at that time. There was a skate shop 2 blocks away from our houses, and we hung out there a lot during the summer. No internet back then obviously, so we would just loiter in the shop for hours watching the newest skate videos and reading Thrasher Magazine. There was a flier up on the wall for a show to be held at the fairgrounds, and Tony Hawk and Gator Rogowski were going to be skating. I remember two things from that show, one was the first time a saw a t-shirt gun, and second was watching Tony Hawk ollie over a Porsche. Here we are 29 years later and Tony is still the most popular skater in the world. Gator is in prison for rape and murder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with Tony Hawk once in a prior job (it was related to his autobiography &quot;Hawk / Occupation: Skateboarder.&quot; [edit: corrected title]). Both he and his management staff were incredibly professional and gracious. From what I can see, everyone who's worked with him wants to work with him again. I have to think that over the years that's been a huge factor in his enduring success. </p>
<p>Also his parents never fucked him over/stole his money, which definitely sets him apart from many/most people who became celebrities when they were young.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a gamer and even I know why. </p>
<p>In 1999 when <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> came out, video games hadn't yet exploded to the level they are today so each year produced just a handful of major hit titles. It was hard <em>not</em> to know which ones were the huge hits even if you didn't own a console. <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> was one of those games that everyone who played games, even those who didn't skateboard themselves, seemed to be playing. </p>
<p>Added to the fact that for 12 straight years he was the National Skateboard Association world champion, plus during the early days of the X Games he was major of star. It was at the 1999 X Games that he performed what is still believed to be the very first 900 and the first <em>Pro Skater</em> video game came out that same year. Plus, he is very media friendly (ie, cleancut) back in an age when almost any drug use even weed made media outlets &amp; advertisers nervous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot about being successful in skateboarding is knowing how to market yourself. You can be an amazing skater, but if you don't have the skills necessary to appeal to an audience you won't sell things with your name on it. Tons of pro skateboarders fall off and lose endorsements and sponserships because they lack in this area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
