Now I have completely different curly ginger hair with the opposite texture. I have heard of hair going straight to curly, but not so much the other way round. Why is this?</p>

<p>&quot;Natal coat is the term for the different coloration of primates during infancy that later changes. Only about 10-20% of primate species are born with different hair color than they'll have as adults.&quot;</p>
<p>Science has not fully explained the natal coat but they are examining different advantages:</p>

<p>Edit: This has a lot of points, so I will clarify here as well as I clarified below in my comments. I am a layperson who developed an interest in this particular question, but I cannot answer the individual-level questions about your hair in particular, nor am I qualified to clarify questions which deal with speculative theories or unpublished research. I hope that evolutionary biologists will step in and do so below for those who've asked clarifying questions that I can't answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of this is due to the changes in hormonal balance and the length you keep your hair. As you age the hormone levels in your body will change impacting your hair texture and sometimes the color. There are other environmental effect other than length as well. For example, humidity will increase the curl potential of your hair as it increases, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gray hair and kinky/curly hair are both related to reactive oxygen species. Kinky hair is due to disulfide bond formation between pairs of the amino acid cysteine. The bond formation is a form of oxidation. Hair gray is caused by bleaching of melanin due to loss of the activity of the enzymes peroxidase and catalyase. Peroxidase and catalayse can lower the levels of reactive oxygen spieces. So likely the loss of curly and the loss of color are both related to the accumulation of ROS. Melatonin used to aid sleep is known to reduce graying of hair. But the reasons are still being investigated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Likely, the genes controlling blonde, straight hair were switched off in your genes through epigenetic regulation, likely through DNA methylation or some other deactivating mechanism.</p>
<p>This can occur due to many different factors, such as hormones, diet, environtment, etc, that can effect which genes are expressed or not.</p>
<p>It is probably hypothetically possible for you to go back to being blonde with straight hair, but your genes would need to be specifically manipulated for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
