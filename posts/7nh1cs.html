		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2nd degree black belt here. I have broken 5-6 bricks at a time for tournaments, belt exams, etc.</p>
<p>It is something of a novelty but it does take skill and practice. There is some research out there indicating that martial artists and boxers have higher bone density due to repeated striking in practice sessions, which causes micro-fractures in bones that heal over time, leading to stronger bones.  I’ve also always used a handwrap (similar to what boxers wear under the glove) to stabilize the wrist.</p>
<p>However, the technique is also important. I have a video of myself breaking 5 bricks. When slowed down, you can see a few things right away that help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Momentum - my vertical jump above the stack is pretty high. So there is a gravity assist.</li>
<li>Torque - up until the moment of strike, someone standing off to the left could read the back of my shirt. That twisting motion creates additional force.</li>
<li>The strike itself - we are taught to aim beyond the target. Mentally I’m aiming for the last brick.</li>
</ol>
<p>The video doesn’t show the mental part obviously. The first time I broke a single brick it was easily one of the most stressful things I’d done.  Hesitation can lead to novices pulling back / not doing the stuff I mentioned above, and failing (potentially causing injury).</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is flashy and cool. I don’t think you could pick a random person off the street and have them do it without injuring themselves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you need to know is that is is all a trick.  They aren't breaking &quot;bricks&quot;, they are breaking low quality, high sand content paving stones arranged in a specific way to give maximum leverage.  Breaking a whole lot of these bricks does take some skill and practice, but just about anyone can break bricks after a few minutes of practice and instruction if they can overcome their fear of hurting themselves.</p>
<p>As for breaking those big stacks, they are simply knocking one brick into the next like dominos.  As I said, it takes skill and practice to do these sorts of stunts.  They are just like a skilled magician, they are doing something hard, but not as impossible as they make it out to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
