		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking the biggest reason is public acceptance. Male mosquitoes don't bite so releasing millions can only help and not hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Male ticks do bite (however, they don't transmit lyme disease). People would be much less likely to agree to releasing millions of biting ticks.</p>
<p>Also, it requires millions to be released at once to overwhelm the numbers of wild males. We are exceedingly good at breeding mosquitoes in captivity. Not sure how good we are at breeding ticks in massive numbers.</p>
<p>edit: added &quot;lyme&quot; thanks to /u/ihateuandurface</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Plus there highly resistent to things like rabies, lyme, etc. They're awesome! Albeit a bit ugly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>besides all the other points made it should be noted that we have absolutely no idea what the long term implications of this are. we should probably refrain from releasing designer parasites into the wild unitl we have long term (30-60 yrs) studies on the effect and potential for mutation... it should be noted also that about 1% of the &quot;sterile&quot; male misquotes were not in fact sterile, which equates to about 5-6 million mosquitoes that were genetically modified that can still breed, and we have no idea what the results of that will be... the last time we did something this (albeit unintentional release) we got killer bees out of the deal. i for one would like to avoid &quot;africanized mosquitoes and/or ticks&quot; thank you very much</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
