		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aight, basic class in economics, let’s go!</p>
<p>People pay taxes to governments, right. Why is it that way? So governments can provide in public infrastructure, social support and all the services they provide to the public. Often this is considered as an investment. Public spending leads to increased economic activity and prosperity which in turns leads to additional tax revenue, and so on.</p>
<p>Often public spending, in the form of investments, are expensive. For example, the construction of a large bridge or airport are an easy example to consider. The additional revenues these assets generate for the government are not always directly noticeably, but they come in the form of tax revenue as a result of increased economic activity. But just as any other investment, you’ll need a large down payment to finance the construction of this asset. The same principle applies to all other services governments provide to the public. </p>
<p>To finance these downpayment, governments often get a loan, as the budget they have, may not cover large investment that foster prosperity. How do they get these loans? Often they publish bonds/obligations. Buyers of the bonds give their money to the government in exchange for the bond. The government commits to paying you a yearly interest as means of compensation for you not being able to use your money for other stuff (for risky countries (e.g. Greece) this interest rate is higher than for stable countries (e.g. Germany) to compensate for the risk that this country may never be able to pay you). At the end of the duration of the bond, legit governments pay you back the face value of your bond, as with common back loans.</p>
<p>Alright, so the chinese government engaged in a shitload of loans to finance its economic activities and growth. Banks, me, possibly your grandmother and your friends, we all bought the bonds. The chinese government has the obligation to pay us back. </p>
<p>1) let’s say they pay us back. Everyone happy! Banks, you and me, we all received our money. Chinese government is happy since they had the money to finance growth or do other government stuff</p>
<p>2) let’s say they don’t pay us back. Your grandmother and your friends won’t be happy and will never buy bonds from the chinese government again, or will be very reluctant to do so. Even worse, banks (public or not) and corporates (state owned or not) that equally bought these bonds do not receive money to fulfill their obligations and go bankrupt. They most likely had obligations themselves. And in turn, their creditors don’t receive their money. This water fall effect in turn leads to other banks and debtors to bail and the country goes into a financial crisis. What’s the result? A) the aimed economic growth was not achieved B) nobody, either your friends, me or banks will ever want to buy bonds from the chinese government, which will not benefit the country.</p>
<p>Soooo, yes, the chinese government could just decide not to pay. But it would be a very bad idea!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the other answers are not addressing your question. If I understand correctly you are asking:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Can the state owned corporations forgive/write off the debt they lent to state owned banks (or vice versa) so that the government do not need to have those debts show up on record?&quot;</strong> </p>
<p>The simplest answer is: Yes. If the banks are the big 5 (BoC, Agrilcultural, Industrial, Construction, People) and the corporations are any one of the companies wholly owned by the Government. </p>
<p>If the politburo do not care about the fallout they absolutely can tell the corporations to strike the loans from their books. </p>
<p>Technically, that would decrease the 'debt' of the government. But there would be problems as the corporations would suddenly lose a large chunk of their assets. These assets are typically held as a way to manage funds or as collateral for operations. Thus, they would need to suddenly recognize a large net loss AND they might have trouble continuing operations due to the sudden loss of funds. Since they are all government, it means the central government would then have to step in and bail them out. The end result is that the central bank would have to spend money to cancel out this debt (in the form of the bail out) that would likely cost MORE than simply servicing the debt and repaying it at the end.  </p>
<p>Most governments would not do this unless they are extremely cash strapped and is in the verge of default.  </p>

<p>ELI 5 answer: </p>
<p>Lets say your brother wants to buy a toy that costs $10. You each get $5 allowance from your parents. He asks you to lend him your half of the allowance so he can buy this toy, telling you that he will pay you back when next month's allowance comes in. You agree. </p>
<p>However, a few days later you want to go see a movie with your friend. The movie costs $10 and you tell your friend that you don't have any money. You ask your friend to pay for you and promise to pay him back when your brother pays you back for the toy. </p>
<p>Now all of this would have been fine if your parents gives you the allowance, your brother pays you back for the toy and you then proceed to pay back your friend for the movie. </p>
<p>On the other hand, your parents may decide that since you are all one big happy family, you and your brother should not owe any money to each other(because in the end, your parents are the ones who paid for the toy anyway). </p>
<p>However, when your friend comes to get money the movie, you don't have enough from your allowance alone  and have to ask your parents to help out. Your parents could either take away your brother's allowance to pay back your friend or they can pay out of their own pockets. </p>
<p>So in the end, your parent's decision to cancel out the debt between you and your brother ended up not accomplishing a whole lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The investors in the bank, the wealthiest citizens, lose a shit ton of money. Some of those are foreign investors. It becomes harder to find creditors to be interested in the economy, and so there will be a credit crunch where people are not able to get a loan in the local currency because the bank is not able to get a loan in New York. People in New York start calling loans in Beijing, and each dollar of loan called pulls 7 Yuan from the economy, but multiplied by some factor because consumption is earnings for someone else. The Chinese authorities have to decide what to do. They can stem the loss by raising interest rates, thereby making it attractive for Chinese residents to keep their money in Yuan, rather than holding onto US dollars (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy/china-says-must-control-money-supply-to-combat-financial-risk-idUSKBN1GG0DY" target="_blank">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy/china-says-must-control-money-supply-to-combat-financial-risk-idUSKBN1GG0DY</a>) and perhaps attract foreign funds as well. But the rise in interest rates would also hurt business and consumer spending, something a country will not want to do if they are already on the edge of a recession. The alternative is to devalue the Yuan, which would not only make exports more competitive but also convince investors that there is still value, even though they ate a loss. If the devaluation occurs, the investors must believe that everything is under control, otherwise devaluation can reinforce the skepticism about the state of the economy and start a panic. So it is traditionally a choice of either increasing interest rates to retain investors, or devaluing the currency to retain investors. Which one you take depends on the actual state of the economy, which is probably not great if you are burning the creditors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
