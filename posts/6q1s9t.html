		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, Marty explained to the Langmores why the $8 million was almost useless to them. Ruth driving a Ferrari around the lake or Russ building a 5,000 sq. ft. house on the lake would draw immediate suspicion. In order to be able to actually spend the money, they need some way to make it look legitimate.</p>
<p>What Marty does is take all the drug money and invest it into legitimate business. Then he can &quot;cook the books&quot; (fake the accounting) to make the businesses appear more profitable than they are. Now he can deposit the drug money in the business account and pay the owners hefty salaries so they receive a legitimate paycheck.</p>
<p>This also helps avoid the Al Capone situation, where the Feds knew what he was doing, but couldn't pin anything on him. They eventually got him on tax evasion. </p>
<p>I assume the show isn't going to go into a lot of detail for the same reason Breaking Bad didn't show the exact recipe for making meth. They want it to be a drama, not a tutorial. As long as you understand that Marty is taking illegally gained money and channeling it through legitimate operations to make everything look on the up and up, that's all we really need to know to enjoy the show. Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a) as /u/cerberus698 has explained there's laundering as in just getting &quot;clean&quot; money that (each note has a individual ID, the bank you robbed might know the IDs of the stolen bills).</p>
<p>b) more importantly, and difficult, is getting money to appear legitimate. </p>
<p>If you rob 1 million dollars from a bank I just need to look for someone who suddenly has a million dollars for no particular reason and I have a suspect. Or, perhaps more effectively, I could look at people who are making lots of money while poorly or unemployed to find drug dealers and other blackmarket operators.</p>
<p>So all those people need a legal &quot;front&quot; from which they &quot;earn&quot; the money they've earned illegally. </p>
<p>For example, in Breaking Bad the family launders money via a car wash company. </p>
<p>The car wash company might see x clients in a day. But you fake the books and say you saw x + y clients in a day, y being fake clients and you put your money from drug dealing/etc in the till equal to the amount they would have paid.</p>
<p>Now given the car wash might break even or make a small loss from its actual clients, this extra money will filter through the business and end up as extra profit which you can pay taxes on and spend without it being obvious you have an extra source of income.</p>
<p>Of course this only works to an extent, if you're laundering loads of money through the car wash it becomes conspicuous. Someone might notice how ridiculously profitable your business is, and then investigate and find you're not seeing enough customers to make as much money.</p>
<p>Thus the need to ever expand money laundering operations.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One day you start taking your dad's porn magazines to school, you sell them at like 2 dollars a pop. Your dad is an avid collector with a boxes full of them stashed away, so he's not noticing that you're taking them. You've started to save a fair bit of money from this so you decide you want to buy a new bike with the money. </p>
<p>But you realized something, won't your parents wonder where you got the money? You can't tell them what you are really doing cause you'll get in trouble. You aren't doing any work or making money from chores or anything and suddenly you've got enough money for a bike? You need to show them that you're a good boy and earned your money fair and square. </p>
<p>You get an idea that you'll start mowing some lawns for pocket money. You ask your parents if you can use the mower and they say yes. Now mowing lawns is hard work so you decide to fake it a little bit. You mow 1 lawn a day but say you did 3. You're only getting 10 bucks for the 1 lawn so you make up for the other 2 with your porn magazine money. </p>
<p>Over a few weeks you've moved all your bad money through the lawn mowing business. You can now buy your bike because you earned it by being a good boy and your parents are so proud.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's use a simple example. You have a lot of illegally earned money. </p>
<p>I have a legitimate business that sells pizzas. You buy a portion of the business (with legal cash), as the owner of the business you are entitled to a share of the profits. You then make a order for 500 pizzas, and pay for it with your illegal cash. </p>
<p>The store will make some money from the sale of those pizzas, more if they never actually make/deliver the pizza, just ring up the sale for it. At the end of the year, the store will show a great deal of profit from the sale of the ghost pizzas. The store will then pass those profits back to the owner as a dividend.</p>
<p>So on paper, it looks like the business is highly profitable, and you have earned a great deal of money as dividend from that business.</p>
<p>Another way is two people to play poker at a las vegas casino. One person will intentionally keep losing to the other person. So the &quot;winner&quot; will just have to declare legitimate casino winnings as their income. Minus of course whatever fees the casino charges to run a private poker game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of laundering money is to conceal the source of income. If you have large sums of money without any way to account for it, the feds are on your ass faster than trailer trash on velveeta, hence dirty money. To clean the money you need a shell business to have a source of documented income so you can actually use all of that money without being on anyone's radar and utilize a bank account. You keep the money but it has to look legit, like clean money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
