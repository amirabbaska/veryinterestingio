		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically this happens with large amounts of really conductive materials like metals. Those sorts of materials don't require a whole lot of energy to change temperature - but they very quickly absorb it and warm up (thus making your body cooler), so your body interprets this temperature change as making the object feel cold.</p>
<p>This property is also evident with water, which will quickly draw heat away from your body, but not warm up much at all. The feeling between the two is fairly similar, which your brain can have some trouble distinguishing sometimes.</p>
<p>Additionally, you could be feeling condensation on the object's surface, which is liquid water that forms from vapor in the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologically speaking your body only has four different kinds of nerves when it comes to basic feelings. They are innervated in different densities around your skin (higher in your fingertips, for example).</p>
<p>The four different types are: Mechanoreceptors - pressure
Nociceptors - pain/damage
Cold thermoreceptors - cold
Hot thermoreceptors - hot</p>
<p>Basically every texture is a combination of these things, or just has its own &quot;wavelength,&quot; if you will. Basically they send signals in the form of action potential in a certain interval, which your brain then interprets based on experience. </p>
<p>When you feel something wet it's cold and smooth, something which is also cold and smooth - e.g. metal - sends the right type of signal will feel wet. I think this is the most common for your brain to not be certain of. That's why the context given by your eyes is important. That got lengthy, hope it clears things up for you though!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been proposed that your body doesn't in fact have &quot;wet&quot; receptors, but instead combines temperature, texture, and pressure to perceive &quot;wetness&quot; and form a sort of &quot;touch memory&quot; based on that. Have you ever worn a latex glove, then dipped your fingers in water? Feels wet, but your fingers are dry inside the glove.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that skin can't detect &quot;wet.&quot; Wetness is inferred from stuff like temperature, texture, and touch. That inference can be fooled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two parts of your brain receive incoming signals. THe first part does a quick and dirty scan of the signal based on past experiences and other factors (did this thing hurt us before? is this thing coming at us or away from us?) as a way to establish if you're in danger or not. The second part further processes the information to get a more accurate picture. The second part takes a bit longer.
When you touch something that is cold and smooth, your brain makes an assumption first based on things that have been cold and smooth in the past, and those things were probably a lot of the time cold, smooth, and wet. Your brain fills in this information under an assumption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
