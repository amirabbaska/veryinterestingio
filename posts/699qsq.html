		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can think of two important reasons. First reading and comprehension increases vocabulary and your understanding of language. Second is what you learn from the material. Even fiction can train your brain to make connections or think in ways that you hadn't before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reading books makes your brain automatically start to dream. The best case is when you actually dream about what you are reading (not something else - happens a lot sometimes). For a very experienced reader a book turns into a movie so to speak played back by his own mind. This dreaming is an excellent workout for your brean which enhances your so called spatial imagination. </p>
<p>You learn to picture written text inside your brain which is VERY helpful in school for example - especially math and physics. Picturing something in your brain allows you to see the problem you are facing from multiple view points and makes you solve it faster. That's why those people reading a lot of books are usually also good in school. </p>
<p>It's not that they read textbooks so much but when they have to read one it is much less painful for them, because their brain is much better suited to deal with the text itself. So while some people still struggle with understanding the text, they allready think about the problem.</p>
<p>Spatial imagination is the key to intelligence. The only reason apes became intelligent is because they had to develop a spatial imagination in order to be able to jump from tree to tree. If you fall you die. If you make it you pass on your genes. So spatial imagination was very beneficial from an evolutionary standpoint. Once they were able to imagine doing something without actually doing it they started to come up with ideas. Ideas to use sticks as tools and what not. (speculative) The point is primates were among the first animals which did not only rely on evolution to get better. They were able to improve themselves by thought and by teaching others. Someone who developed a cool technique to get food told it the others and they all survived. <strong><a href="http://i.imgur.com/L6hXgpo.gifv" target="_blank">Relevant .gif</a></strong></p>
<p>The key breakthrough of course came when early humans started to draw things on walls. They were able to save information to future generations and it didn't take long until pictures turned into a written language. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I go through phases of reading a lot of books, then losing motivation and stopping reading. When I read feel a boost in my spatial intelligence abilities, something I don't get from other medias like watching TV. Probably comes from having to mentally visualise things when reading. I find reading a good form of escape from reality, so if in a stressful environment reading provides a good way of focusing the mind on something more positive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
