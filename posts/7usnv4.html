<p>Now let's say you just flip a coin. Half the men get heads, half the men get tails. So now you have 10 men who have no idea if they have prostate cancer or not, and they all need more testing done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine this is in terms of a fire alarm in a dorm.  Most of the time, the fire alarm isn’t going off.  But when it does, you definitely want to evacuate the dorm and take a look.</p>
<p>75% or more of fire alarms are probably false positives.  Someone microwaved their popcorn too long. Chad drunkenly pulled the alarm handle on his way out the door.  Or the alarm system is on the fritz.  Damnit, woken up at 4am again.</p>
<p>But one day, there is actually a fire.  And everyone is glad they actually evacuated.</p>
<p>Would flipping a coin be better?  No, the fire alarm is doing real work.  Most of the time, it doesn’t go off.  And when it does, you should definitely investigate what’s wrong, even if eventually it’s determined to not be a fire.</p>
<p>There may also be the occasional time the alarm misses a fire (false negative), and the alarm manufacturer will keep doing their best to avoid that too.  But that’s no reason not to use a fire alarm - it’s just a reason to use the best fire alarm you can get, or maybe to install two different ones just in case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The false positives aren't so bad.  What you absolutely do not want are false negatives.</p>
<p>If the test says you have prostate cancer and you don't, that just means they give you additional screening.  Inconvenient, scary, but not so bad all told.</p>
<p>If the test says you don't have prostate cancer and you do... that's bad.</p>
<p>So tests are designed to minimize false negatives.  Part of that involves increasing the risk of false positives.</p>
<p>PS: I haven't seen anyone else refer to a  table, so let me expand this idea with one.  Suppose a 1000 people are tested, both with a screening test and a more certain method.  We might get numbers like these</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">cancer</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">no cancer</th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><em>total</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>test+</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">18</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">54</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">72</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>test-</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">2</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">926</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">928</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>total</em></strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">20</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">980</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">1000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>which might help make the numbers make more sense.  (In this example, I'm assuming 2% of people have prostate cancer.)  Note the total column/row have to sum to 1000.  Note also that most people get a negative result on the screening test.  This is good.  If it was split 50-50 on the screening test, then the test would be worthless.  If someone gets a positive on the test, there is then a chance for a false positive.  And you'll notice that on the top row, the total of positive results was 72, with 54 false positives; that is, 75% false positive.</p>
<p>But look what happened to the true positives.  Out of 72 positive, 18 of them were correct, which is 25%.  That is much larger than the 2% rate in the general population.  This test helped us learn more about whether a person has cancer, even though there are so many false positives.  Rather than testing every person with a more invasive and expensive test, we can use this screen first to narrow things down, from 1000 people to just 72 people.</p>
<p>Consider another &quot;test&quot;.  In this one, we roll a six-sided die and say they have cancer on a 6.  We have 1000 people, and we'll say exactly 20 of them have prostate cancer (2%).  Of those twenty who have cancer, we will &quot;diagnose&quot; 1/6 of them, which I'll round down to 3.  That means we missed 17 of them.  Of the 980 people who don't have cancer, we will &quot;diagnose&quot; 1/6th of them, which I'll round down to 163.  We get this table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">cancer</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">no cancer</th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><em>total</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>test+</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">3</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">163</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">166</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>test-</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">17</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">817</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">834</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>total</em></strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">20</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">980</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">1000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Rhis is pretty clearly a worthless test.  For instance, 166 people tested positive, and 3 of them have cancer, which comes out to 2% of the positives.  This test gave us no new information.  I already knew statistically that 2% of people would have prostate cancer, so I already knew 3 out of 166 would have it.  More to it, there are 17 people with cancer who I just said were fine, who are now going to get sick and die and it's my fault.  There are also 163 people who I scared for no reason and subjected to expensive rectal exams.  This is a horrible test, really.  It's horrible because the result has nothing to do with whether they have cancer or not.</p>
<p>There are basically three things I want out of a test.  Consider a table</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">cancer</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">no cancer</th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><em>total</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>test+</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Y</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T+</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>test-</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Z</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">W</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">T-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>total</em></strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">C+</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">C-</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">1000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>where Z,X,Y,W,T+,T-,C+,C- are all numbers.  I want X/T+ to be much larger than C+/1000, because the larger it is the better my test is at restricting the people I treat for prostate cancer.  I also want Z/T- to be as low as possible -- these are my false negatives, and they are literally deadly.  Further, I would like to reduce Y/T+, which are my false positives.  But the two <em>essential</em> things are that X/T+ &gt; C+/1000 (or its a useless test) and that Z/T- is as low as possible, or I kill people.  Reducing false positives is also nice, but it isn't always possible to minimize false positives <em>and</em> false negatives; part of how you reduce false negatives is to make the test more sensitive so that it is easier to test positive, and that will increase false positives.</p>
<p>So if you can only fix two, you fix X/T+ and Z/T-, and it's still a good test.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High number of false positive but low number of false negatives.  Basically if the text is positive, 75% of the time it is wrong, but, it will catch 90% of the cancers (don’t know if that is the actual number but you get the point). Where as a negative test is truly negative 99% of time (1%of the time a test will say negative when the cancer exists). Again, i am making up the actual numbers but the concept applies. Sensitivity and specificity are the medical testing terms. A good screening test will have a high sensitivity (catches all the cancers but can have a lot of false positives) which is why you screen with it and then have follow up testing to confirm or deny the existence of what you are screening for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing error rate with base rate.</p>
<p>You don't mention what rate men get prostate cancer, and that's the important base rate.  The base rate is 1 in 7.</p>
<p>Flipping a coin has a base rate of 1 in 2, so it's a horrible equivalence.  Perhaps you could roll a dice and say that everybody who rolls 6 has prostate cancer, then you'd be closer.</p>
<p>When a test has 75% false positive, that means 75% of the people it says have cancer don't have it.  This means 25% do.  Let's presume it has a 0% false negative rate (and that 7 = 8 to simplify the math).</p>
<p>You give the test to 8 men and one of them has cancer.  The test says 4 men have cancer (where I think you got the coin-flip analogy).  However, it also says 4 men don't have cancer, and it's completely correct about that.  The men it gives a positive result have a 1 in 4 chance of having cancer, which is significantly elevated from 1 in 7.  Those men need to get a more expensive and sensitive test, but you can afford that because you don't need to test any of the 4 men who the test cleared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
