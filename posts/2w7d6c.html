<p>It's happening in the Netherlands. Maybe their laws don't forbid suicide missions. Also, the volunteers will be dieing off-planet (hopefully), so that's definitely not regulated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No precedent for colonial pioneers? There's tonnes. Not least a thing in the 60s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race#Onward_to_the_Moon" target="_blank">Space Race</a>. It wasn't illegal to send men to the moon, nor is it to Mars.</p>
<p>Bear this in mind - when the pioneers set sail looking for a western passage to India, they did so in the expectation that they would return but with the knowledge that many such expeditions were lost with all hands.</p>
<p>The American continent literally would not have been discovered with the mindset that &quot;you might die&quot; was a good reason not to go. You might die getting out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Colonialism on Earth isn't terribly big these days because most land has been laid claim to by one party or another, and some areas (such as Antarctica) are governed by international treaty. In order to colonise somewhere, you'll have to displace the native residents. It is forcible displacement (or seizure of land) that is forbidden..</p>
<p>For Mars, there are no natives. The company will have to comply with the relevant health and safety rules, use human-rated flight hardware, and generally not be grossly negligent, but otherwise the risk is on the volunteers. They're going in the knowledge that the project will engineer the mission to the highest possible standards, but that even then there could be an accident, equipment failure or other problem. They accept the risk as pioneers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I get the feeling you are suggesting that since there is a high probability of death, this is essentially a &quot;Suicide Mission&quot; and therefore the recruiters could be considered to have murdered, or negligently killed, the crew by putting the project together and allowing them to go through with it.</p>
<p>Legally, crimes require a &quot;mens rea&quot;, which means a state of mind about the crime.  If you do something while you're sleepwalking, you didn't mean to do it, so you don't have the &quot;mens rae&quot; for the crime.  Because they are not intending to have those contestants die...despite probabilities, I'm assuming they want the crew to live...then they lack the mens rae for murder.  </p>
<p>There are two lesser charges that don't carry the mens rae.  One is a &quot;reckless heart murder&quot; (often called manslaughter) where the person has such wanton and reckless disregard for the risks that they might as well have had the intent to have death happen.  That isn't going on here, since they are fully disclosing the risks and not forcing anyone.  There is also negligent manslaughter - you weren't ebing reckless, just real dumb, so dumb that you shoulda been more careful so it's basically your fault.  Again, they explained the risks, and this would only (likely) apply if someone utterly failed at the basics of their job, resulting in an unforeseen death.</p>
<p>Hope that overly technical response to your question helps, if that;s what you were looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
