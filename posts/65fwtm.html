		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of different answers with different aspects of this but none that really line up to the perspective that I read about when I studied historical fashion!</p>
<p>The suit became fashionable at the fall of the aristocracy and the rise of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>When people, men, started gaining power and influence because of their accomplishments, which is tied to the industrial revolution, and it was no longer something that was strictly inherited the philosophy and society changed and the view of the nobility was that they were lazy, gaudish, extravagant, decadent, wasteful and just terrible overall.</p>
<p>So the old power fashion with extravagant and overdone clothing became the symbol for something bad. Like this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/raFyUij.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/raFyUij.jpg</a></p>
<p>Also, look at the legs, and heels on the shoes. Those kind of things became very feminine and the anti-thesis of men. Men where supposed to be rational and strict and those kind of expressions where for women who are more emotional etc. The view on sexuality also changed a lot at the same time, especially female sexuality. Sexuality was seen as something irrational and the purity of women and romance of love became more prevalent as well.</p>
<p>So the suit became the fashion for men with power. But how do you differentiate a bad suit from a good suit from a great suit? You really need to understand the details to actually tell the difference and that played into the idea of your own accomplishments etc. In many ways the fashion became so much more elitist. With the old fashion it was pretty much bigger was better, the one with the biggest and most extravagant clothing had the most power. Everyone could tell, from the poorest farmer to the king himself. But with the new fashion of the suit only the people in the know could tell. A poor farmer could impossibly tell the difference from what was considered a great suit from a simply good suit. So by simply knowing that it gave someone power.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this is the male fashion of watches that is still big today, unless you actually know you can't tell the difference from a superexpensive watch and a regular watch. Most of what makes the expensive watch so expensive is on the inside, it is the engineering and craftmanship that makes the watch special more than its gold and diamonds etc.</p>
<p>This also plays into the ideal of men as being rational and logical, there is a certain worth in craftmanship, jewelery is just pretty and doesn't have an inherent worth. Things that are just pretty are for women to appreciate, men appreciate things with absolute worth, or that is the idea anyway. </p>
<p>And you can see this ideal and philosophy in a lot of things, it plays into why men care so much about sports, because it is seen as having an absolute worth, it is something you can measure. So it is seen as more important than other things.</p>
<p>And of course, Europe where this all started have been the powercenter of the world and been seen as the ideal for most of the world in many ways so other cultures adopted this as they were dealing with Europe in different ways. Or you know, the whole imperialism as well where we pushed our ideals on other cultures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is grouping up China and Japan into the same &quot;Eastern wears Western&quot; status, but the way western suits are worn in Japan and China are entirely different. In Japan it is a very formal symbol of being a Business person. But in China only businesses which are partly foreign owned and make most of their money dealing with foreign clients require this. Most regular business (at least in Beijing) dress smart casual to the office and the formal places would just require a dress shirt and dress pants. Actually it is a joke in China that if you wear a suit, people will think you are an apartment rental agent (real estate) because that is the only job that really requires all their workers to wear suits.
You will be surprised to know that Chinese people don't wear suits to formal occasions - if you go watch an opera or to an orchestra performance or go to a nice club you will rarely see any guy in a western suit. Most regular middle class Chinese men don't have a formal suit in their closet.</p>
<p>Edit: Also why is no one talking about Thailand. They have their own business suit that is pretty common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's like how the preppiest preppies started popping their collars in the '80s, so it spread because anyone who wanted to consider themselves a preppie started popping their collars, too.</p>
<p>Except on a global scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
