		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume it's the same for soap, but as a hairdresser I can say that yeah, shampoos and conditioners for different things actually are different, especially if it's a professional product -cheaper products may contain lower quality ingredients and are often much harsher but should still do the job of cleaning your hair.</p>
<p>To keep it simple a colour protecting shampoo will be sulfate free, a shampoo for fine hair may be silicone free while one for coarser hair may not be, shampoo for curly hair may be designed so that it won't lather as much, and one for damaged hair will contain more protein than a shampoo that isn't for damaged hair.</p>
<p>Designing a &quot;one size fits all&quot; product is very difficult since ingredients will contradict each other and using something good for one hair type could be terrible for another. For example, for damaged hair to really get the benefits of a shampoo there would have to be extra protein, and extra protein isn't good for healthy hair and can actually make it brittle since it's too much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked for an industrial soap making company, and yes, each of our soaps were designed to lift a specific range of grimes from specific surfaces. There are surfactants which help wet a surface so the soap molecules can cosy up to the grime, chelates which help the molecules disperse the grime into solution, the soap molecules which are double ended. One end sticks to a bit of some kind of dirt, the other end sticks to water. Flush and rip dat dirt outta there.
But there are many other things that affect the performance of a detergent like moderating bits, protectors and conditioners for the clean surface, perfumes and colors.</p>
<p>Heat improves activity in most chemistry so a temperature range for best results is according to the formulation.</p>
<p>Complex stuff. Your mileage may vary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong here:</p>
<p>I was always taught shampoos/soaps that boasted about containing vitamins were bullshit because your skin/hair can't absorb them and it's all a marketing ploy. I've tried googling it, but of course all that pops up are beauty blogs talking about vitamin enriched products. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently learned on Reddit that tide is more expensive because the enzymes and ingredients they use are more expensive then most other laundry soap. My son gets bloody noses frequently and tide gets his sheets clean every time. We have tried others and would love to save money on a cheaper detergent, but whatever they use in tide is unique and worth the price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think soaps all use the same detergents, just varying amounts of it. The cheap soaps have mostly fragrance &amp; sulfates, while better soaps contain less sulfates (or none at all, like lye soaps) and more moisturizers. I buy most of my soaps locally, as they are cheap and I have very sensitive skin. You can make your own soap from a kit at Michael's and make your own scent. Better quality soaps are completely worth it and they aren't ridiculously more expensive for a better soap.
Shampoo is a completely different story and doing your research is tedious. Cheap brands are mostly water &amp; bubbles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
