Usually I’d just figure they would bill your credit card for shipping and handling but these places don’t even ask for a credit card.</p>
<p>Sexyliberation.org is a company that gives away free sex toys</p>
<p>Proctor &amp; Gamble will literally send you tons of sample products: <a href="https://www.pgeveryday.com/tag/product-samples-offers" target="_blank">https://www.pgeveryday.com/tag/product-samples-offers</a></p>
<p>I mean, there is an entire subreddit devoted to companies giving away free things: /r/freebies</p>
<p>How exactly do they make money by just giving stuff away?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual cost of <em>producing</em> those products is only a fraction of the cost the average consumer will usually end up paying for them. Meanwhile, marketing is actually a huge expense for businesses.</p>
<p>i.e. Let's say a vibrator costs $10 to make. The company usually sells for $20. You get one for free - to you, it's a savings of $20, but to the company, it's a loss of only $10. It's risky, but people are creatures of habit.</p>
<p>When this vibrator breaks or no longer satisfies you, you'll likely go back to that particular company. Assuming every vibrator costs $20, then just buying one will recoup costs for the company (since you've paid $20, and the company has given you two vibrators that cost them $10 each to make). Then, any <em>more</em> you buy will be more profitable for them.</p>
<p>Especially since word of mouth from your friends is often one of the biggest influences on a consumer. You happen to brag about how awesome that vibrator is to your friend, and when their boyfriend dumps them and they need something to get them through the day, they'll go the company you were bragging about. And then they'll form a habit or positive association with this company, so when their vibrator gets stolen by that creepy one-night stand and they need a new one, they'll also go back to this same company.</p>
<p>So in this hypothetical, the company gives away one free vibrator, which only costs them $10, and in return guarantee four more vibrators bought, each of which brings the company a $10 net profit (-$10 cost of production + $20 sale of vibrator = $10 profit). So that's $40 in profit off of the vibrators directly resulting from this one freebie. Subtract the cost of the freebie, and they just $30 profit.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - Company gives you a $10 vibrator for free because they'll get a $30 net profit from it.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a marketing expense... a company needs to spend $X on acquiring each customer. That could be by running TV ads, could be direct mail, could be coupons in the newspaper, could be banner ads, could be samples of their product. </p>
<p>A company like Proctor &amp; Gamble has many products that, once people begin to use them, they remain loyal. Things like laundry detergent, soap, deodorant, packaged food, etc. They can run a ton of TV commercials claiming that &quot;NEW Tide with Nuclear Power Cleaning Action&quot; is the best thing ever, spending millions in the process, and hope you'll spend $20 on a jug next time you're at Wal-Mart or Target. Or they can spend $1 to send you a sample and have you see for yourself and do the same for a million more people... similar cost, different tactic, probably better results. And then you'll definitely grab that $20 jug of that detergent at the store and every other time you need more laundry detergant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, people are risk <del>adverse</del> averse. If you need to make a purchase of something, you will generally go with something you know (or heard of) is decent versus something unknown. Free products help people &quot;know&quot; what is out there so in the future, they will purchase something they have tried and liked before over an unknown competing product.</p>
<p>For example, Monster energy drinks. The company gives out free drinks to freshmen in college. The freshmen like the taste and how it allows them to stay up to study. Throughout their years in college, they buy more of them since its known and familiar. Maybe when they graduate and join a startup, they have the company stock Monster drinks in the company fridge. A few free samples turns a person into a lifelong customer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I own a very small business and I do this all the time. </p>
<p>Advertising is very expensive. Just a small advertisement in my local paper is over $400 and forget about a billboard or TV commercial. </p>
<p>But if I take $100 worth of my product (at cost) and canvas an event where my type of customer will be, and I hand them out for free with a homemade flyer, that (for me) has proven to create a lot more revenue then any advertisement I have ever bought. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that people use the samples, like them, and then buy the real product.  The sample only lasts a little while and they are dirt cheap to make.  While the company spends money on the samples, it really is just part of their marketing budget.  TV ads can cost hundreds of thousands or million of dollars - you can make a lot of samples and get them into people's hands for that much money, and possibly convince more people to buy your stuff than an ad ever will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
