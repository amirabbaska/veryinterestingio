		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sublingual (under the tongue) administration does bypass the stomach, obviously, but all of your blood will eventually pass through the liver (via the hepatic artery). However, unlike substances absorbed in the stomach and small intestine (oral administration into the hepatic portal vein, which brings everything through the liver first), medication administered sublingually goes to the heart <em>first</em>, then on to the liver if it happens to travel inferiorly (downward). This is why nitroglycerin is administered sublingually to treat angina pectoris (cardiac-related chest pain).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here. Certainly not a board-certified expert yet, but I can weigh in a bit on this. The benefit of taking medications sublingually (below the tongue) is that the drug enters your blood more quickly, and has a greater opportunity to exert its effects.</p>
<p>Consider this -- when you take a pill, it needs time to pass through the stomach and be absorbed primarily through the intestines. After it's absorbed by the gut, the first place that blood goes is straight to the liver. Your body is smart, and it's configured to send the &quot;collecting&quot; blood from the gut right to the liver in case you've absorbed something bad. Some drugs are highly susceptible to this process, which is called &quot;first pass metabolism.&quot; In fact, some drugs can't be given orally at all, because having all of the dose hit the liver right after absorption ensures that they're not gonna be effective. This is why you can't take birth control with certain antibiotics (Rifampin) -- the antibiotic makes the liver more trained for destroying it and similar drugs, including birth control. Additionally, some drugs simply aren't absorbed at all by the gut, so you can't get them in that way.</p>
<p>When you're absorbing the pill elsewhere, be it under your tongue or through an IV, it isn't all going straight to the liver. Yes, it will eventually get there, but it will do so more slowly and not at once. In the meantime, the drug can spread throughout your blood and reach other targets in the body rather than hit the brick wall that is your liver. There is a greater chance for the drug to do its job, as opposed to going &quot;Stomach -&gt; Liver -&gt; Gone&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist input:
For most drugs, First Pass Metabolism breaks down the majority of a drug.  That is, after it is swallowed and absorbed, it goes first to the liver where a large amount of broken down BEFORE getting into systemic circulation.<br />
Going across your oral mucosa (buccal or sublingual) means I gets into systemic circulation (1) quickly, and (2) at a high blood level.<br />
Not all orally disintegrating drugs are able to cross the mucosa like this.  Some are just better tolerated if they melt away in the mouth.  These still get swallowed and get metabolized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some medications require an acidic environment to be best absorbed, some have coatings that allow them to pass the stomach and be best absorbed in the small intestines (duodenum), and others need to be metabolized by the liver to become effective (prodrugs). So yes, some medications will reach the bloodstream faster, but may be in the wrong concentrations or forms... Or just taste awful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
