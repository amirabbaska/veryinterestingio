		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the other comments here, the oxidizing agent in gunpowder (potassium nitrate, commonly called saltpeter [thank you /u/CaptMercaptan], is used in traditional black powder) is what enables the explosion at all. The speed of a combustion reaction depends on the availability of heat, fuel (reducing agent) and oxygen (oxidizing agent). </p>
<p>In most cases, like a bonfire, oxygen is the limiting reagent. The fire spreads slowly because the logs burn up all the oxygen right around them, and new oxygen only flows to the fire so fast. That's why you can blow on a fire to make it bigger, because you're helping more oxygen-rich air replace the oxygen-poor air that is right around the logs. Also, the logs can only burn on their outmost layers, because the inside of the log can't get any oxygen.</p>
<p>In an explosion, the fuel and oxygen react with each other almost instantaneously. In order to do that, they have to be evenly mixed so that every bit of fuel has enough oxygen available to it. In a car engine, this is done by spraying a small amount of gas into a chamber with fresh air to make a mist of gas and air. When the sparkplug adds an ignition source, it explodes, and the huge surge in pressure makes your piston expand. </p>
<p>In gunpower, this mixture of fuel and oxygen comes from the sulfur and charcoal (fuel) being mixed in the right ratio with the KNO_3, which can donate it's oxygen atoms. That lets the combustion happen fast enough to launch a bullet at the speed of sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have oxygen in the cartridge...in the form of air and potassium nitrate. Essentially, the difference between something that burns when allowed to or explodes when allowed to is oxygen availability. Things that explode have their oxygen supplied by the chemicals directly in them while things that merely burn rely on room air to supply oxygen.</p>
<p>Some chemical reactions can explode via other chemicals instead of oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like all explosives, it brings its own oxygen along for the ride. Many explosives have a fuel component, and an oxidizer component whether it's gunpowder, dynamite, or the fuel/air explosions in an internal combustion engine. </p>
<p>Bullets for instance would work under water or in space and if an astronaut fired a gun while floating in space, they could actually use it as a form of propulsion. Rockets work on a similar principal, bringing the oxygen with them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As is with all explosives, it has its own supply of oxygen so it can theoretically burn in space (explode if it's in a confined space).</p>
<p>The traditional oxidizer in gunpowder was potassium nitrate (KNO3) aka saltpeter </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
