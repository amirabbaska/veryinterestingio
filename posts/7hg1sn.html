I would think it's a matter of pressure but I don't know that much about physics. I would also think the cruise ship ones have to be stronger because a tiny leak of water sounds worse than a tiny leak of air. Either way just something I was wondering.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a barometric pressure standpoint, a window or other skin of a pressurized compartment in a commercial plane will typically be subjected to pressure of about 0.5 atm.</p>
<p>This assumes cabin pressurized to equivalent of 8000 feet ASL, at flight level 38000:</p>
<p>8000 ft:  574 mmHg</p>
<p>38000 ft: 172 mmHg</p>
<p>Net pressure: 402 mmHg / 760 â‰ˆ 0.53 atm</p>
<p>An equivalent pressure would be exerted on a window submerged in 5.5 m (18 ft.) of water.</p>
<p>In the plane case, the pressure differential would rise and fall slowly and smoothly and within well defined limits.</p>
<p>In the ship case, the pressure is more chaotic with brief but large spikes.</p>
<p>It really depends on how close to the calm waterline these windows are.  That will determine how battered they are by breaking storm waves and how deeply submerged they can be in swells.   In general, I think the ship glass has the tougher job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the ship and window in question, but it's most likely that the airplane window will be stronger, but the ship window will be thicker. Airplanes use polycarbonate (Lexan) for the window material, which is not only lighter than glass, but much stronger (up to 200x stronger than untempered glass, ~50x stronger than tempered glass). The outer pane thickness is about 0.5&quot; and the inner pane is about 0.15&quot;, with a quarter inch gap between them. </p>
<p>I would think that the airplane window would be under much higher stress than a ship window in the course of normal operation, though I haven't done the math to back this up. In flight, the cabin pressure is around 12 psi and the ambient pressure is 3 psi, so you have a net outward pressure of 9 psi. On a ship window, above the water line, the ambient pressure and cabin pressure are the same. You'd have to go 20 feet or so below the waterline to get the same pressure differential on the ship as you have on the airplane (though the pressure would be pressing inwards on the ship). It's true that the ship has waves and wake crashing on it, but the airplane window has aerodynamic stresses, which I think would be much larger than with a wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One additional aspect not mentioned yet: The ships windows must not only be able to withstand the waves, but must also be safe in the case of floating debris in the water. I don't know the details, but I've seen that information in a TV documentation about ship building.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ships, for sure. </p>
<p>Planes can withstand many small holes without losing pressurization. The leaks would likely be able to compensated for with a little extra strain on the pressurization system. Too many holes, or a blown out window, would be a different story, but could still structurally survive with some emergency equipment for crew and passengers. </p>
<p>Leaks in ships are similarly not the end of the world, but you definitely wouldn't want them springing up with any regularity or in difficult-to-patch locations (such as in the middle of a pane of glass). Typically there's not a lot of below-water-line windows, but those that exist are definitely more durable than the clear poly-carbonate of plane windows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
