		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if by heavy you mean will it have the same amount of matter/energy. </p>
<p>This is because burning is a chemical reaction that breaks the bonds between some atoms and creates new bonds with others. This produces heat and light, but doesn't change the number of atoms from beginning to end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The answers here are incorrect. Mass is <em>not</em> in general conserved, only energy is. </p>
<p>Since you are releasing energy, the mass of the products is lighter than the mass of the reactants. This is because to release energy, the potential energy of the chemical bonds must have decreased. This is the same as a decrease in mass, since E=mc^2</p>
<p>Now you may ask if E=mc^2, then why is the mass not the same if the energy is the same? It's because E=mc^2 is only true for a object at rest, ie not moving. In general, there are other terms that contribute to the energy. A photon, for example, has energy but no mass. When you burn something and release heat, you release it as thermal (kinetic) energy and light. These forms of energy do not contribute to the mass of the system; only the chemical potential energy in the matter does. This has decreased, so you have decreased the total mass of the system. </p>
<p>That said, the change in mass is negligible. C^2 is really big, so it takes only a tiny bit of mass to release a lot of energy. For most reactions you can ignore it and assume the mass is roughly the same. But it is important to remember that it's not the same in theory.</p>
<p>Edit: I have a degree in physics. Of course I could still be wrong, but I doubt it. If you disagree with me, please explain why. But don't just downvote an answer because it's different from what you learned in your grade 11 chemistry class.  </p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass–energy_equivalence" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass–energy_equivalence</a></p>
<p>The important phrase is </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chemical</strong>, nuclear, and other energy transformations may cause a system to lose some of its energy content (and thus some corresponding mass), releasing it as light (radiant) or thermal energy for example. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit 3: I'm also kinda wrong. As many have pointed out, the answer depends on how you consider the question. First, do you mean weight, relativistic mass, or invariant mass? Second, do you consider the box to be your system, or each molecule to be a separate system, and add the masses of them all? Roughly speaking, do you mean the mass <em>of</em> the box, or <em>inside</em> the box. I assumed op meant the sums of the invariant masses of each molecule, in which case the mass is not the same. The invariant mass of the box as a whole does not change, nor does the weight of the box or of the particles inside the box. I'll leave my answer up since the other answers were right for the wrong reasons, but keep in mind that while my explanation is correct, the result might be wrong depending on how you consider the problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in this thread seems to have remembered conservation of energy, but forgotten conservation of momentum. If we take a closed system of wood in a box full of air, and burn the wood, the overall momentum of the box must remain constant. If there are no external forces acting on this hypothetical box, it's velocity (or speed for eli5) remains constant, meaning it's mass must remain constant. Y'all need to forget about E=mc^2 if you don't actually know what it means or how to use it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, yes. To grossly oversimplify it you are taking the carbon and hydrogen in the paper structure and reacting it with oxygen. </p>
<p>That creates water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The amount of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the volume hasn't changed - they're just rearranged from a solid and some light gas into heavier gases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking no, but for all intents and purposes yes.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, only energy is conserved not mass, but the change in mass is usually imperceptible. </p>
<p>I've done a calculation using the famous E=mc^2 for how much mass you would need to get the energy released by burning a kg of paper. In reality the change of mass to energy isn't occurring as directly (the energy comes from breaking chemical bonds), and there's probably a lot more going on making my &quot;calculations&quot; totally useless, but anyways... </p>
<p>If we suppose that a we get  30000 kJ of energy burning a 1kg of paper (using approx. numbers for 1kg of coal from <a href="https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kgSKE-to-kJ.html" target="_blank">here</a>) and we use the rearranged formula m=E/c^2 we get the number 3.338 *10^-10 kg or </p>
<p>0.3338 nanograms, which is basically nothing :)</p>
<p>This is how much mass you would need, if you could transform it directly to energy, but again the real process is probably a lot more &quot;messy&quot;, making concrete numbers useless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
