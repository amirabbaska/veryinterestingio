<p>Why does UK English not put a &quot;the&quot; in front of hospital?</p>
<p>I can't think of any other nouns that have this same lack of &quot;the.&quot;</p>
<p>No one says &quot;he was in restroom&quot; or &quot;he was in grocery.&quot;</p>

<p>Educational institutions like School, College or university. </p>
<p>I don't know the reasons for it, but what you have to remember as well is that the British aren't the ones who branched off and changed things. There is the British standard English and American standard English, both are technically correct to a degree. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other similar ones such as going to church/school/bed.</p>
<p>The distinction between those and things like the grocer, is that they convey the idea of being in a certain state.</p>
<p>e.g. I'm going to church vs I'm going to the church.</p>
<p>The first implies you are going to church for Sunday service or similar.
The second just means you are going to the physical church building.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why they diverged on some things like hospital but not others.</p>
<p>Edit: to add...   so in the UK we might say, I'm going to THE hospital (to visit my friend), but I'm going to hospital (for surgery)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an &quot;abstract state&quot;, rather than a specific instance. So if I said &quot;I'm going to the hospital&quot;, people would infer I mean the local one, or perhaps a specific one which is clear from context (eg we have an eye hospital in my town) -- and it may not be for treatment, I could be visiting a friend. But if I said &quot;I'm going to hospital&quot;, it could be any hospital anywhere; it also clearly indicates I will be a patient (the state of being In Hospital).</p>
<p>Another case I can think of is clubs/societies: &quot;This one time, in Band Camp...&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you drop a/the, you're implying that the next word is a transitive state.</p>
<p>In denial, in grief, in school, etc.; it's a state of being.</p>
<p>So in hospital would imply he's in the state of being treated, while 'in the hospital' has more emphasis on WHERE he is.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone can explain it more technically correct, but you can see there's a difference plainly between the two, rather than just a difference in dialect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
