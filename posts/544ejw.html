		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum to the information already provided here:</p>
<p>Its not just visible light that'll produce a tangible thrust.  Any wavelength of light will.   This becomes a problem for space probes, because electronics and power supplies turning on and off create heat in the infrared spectrum, and these infrared photons cause a small thrust which over long periods of time will cause the probe to veer off course.</p>
<p>There's actual computer simulation and modeling done at NASA to account for this infrared-thrust effect when setting probe trajectories and course corrections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very slowly.</p>
<p>Light has momentum, even though it is massless, so if you shoot a beam of light in one direction, conservation of momentum will push you in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>A reasonably powerful LED flashlight will use about 1-3 Watt, lets say 3 W. The efficiency of a LED is somewhere between 25% and 40%, so for sake of ease of computation lets make that 33% and we get a net amount of light output of 1 W. </p>
<p>The ratio between the momentum and energy of light is 299,792,458 (Which is also the speed of light). So in 1 second, the flashlight produces 1 J worth of light, which is equal to 0.33 * 10^-8 kg m/s. If the flashlight is not too heavy, say 100 gram or 0.1 kg, that means that 1 second of light would propel the flashlight to a velocity of 10^-7 m/s. This assumes that all light is directed in straight line. The more cone-shaped the bundle of light is, the lower the momentum transfer is.</p>
<p>Leaving the light on for one day would propel the flashlight to about 0.009 m/s or almost 1 cm per second. Unfortunately, operating a 3 W LED for a day uses about 260 kJ of energy. Regular AA batteries have somewhere around 10 kJ of energy (depending on the type). And at a weight of 20-30 grams per battery, you can't carry put more than 2-3 in the device without violating our original assumption of a 100 gram device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other answers have said, Yes.</p>
<p>In terms of using this as actual spaceship propulsion (powered by solar panels), there is a slightly easier way:</p>

<p>Which reflects the sun's light to generate (tiny amounts of) thrust!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a classic physics trick problem where you ask students to figure out the best way to gain momentum using only a flashlight or laser pointer while in space. The trick of the question is that it's better to simply throw the flashlight/laser pointer than to bother turning it on!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerospace Engineer here. In college we were presented a question during class on this very topic. Essentially, if you're an astronaut and get separated from your space craft and all you have is a flashlight - can you get back to the ship?</p>
<p>Long answer - If you turn on the flash light and point it in the direct-opposite direction of the space craft. Yes. But it is going to take a long time.</p>
<p>Short answer - If you throw the flashlight in the direct-opposite direction of the space craft. Yes. But you're a lot more likely to mess up your trajectory and miss the ship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
