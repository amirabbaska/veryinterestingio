		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clothing seems to cover the genitals across all cultures. </p>
<p>Reading on Wikipedia, it seems that covering the genitals began at most 72,000 years ago, as remains have been found with clothing from that time. But for all of recorded history across all cultures that recorded history, clothing that covered at least the genitals was considered natural and normal for everyday life.</p>
<p>Glorious Wikipedia claims, in the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity" target="_blank">history of nudity</a>, that nudity was the norm in &quot;warmer climates&quot; until the introduction of Islam or Christianity. It claims that nudity is still the norm in &quot;Mursi, Surma, Nuba, Karimojong, Kirdi, Dinka and sometimes Maasai people in Africa, as well as Matses, Yanomami, Suruwaha, Xingu, Matis and Galdu people in South America&quot;. Upon further examination all of these claims are sourced to <a href="https://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok/" target="_blank"><em>Active Naturists</em>, &quot;what if nudity were a norm?&quot; (sic)</a>, a nudist <del>blog post</del> scholarly journal, surely. I'm sure it's a great source, since it's cited on Wikipedia and all, but it seems to stake its claims that nudity was the norm among those peoples on questionable grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artwork and statuary, mostly from the ancient Greeks, who notably liked naked young guys and also are not any of the people listed</li>
<li>Photos of African boys/men during nude initiation rites</li>
<li>Quotes from noted racist Henry Morton Stanley about the clothing habits of &quot;the naked savages&quot; during appeals to the British to claim African colonies and convert the natives &quot;to the wearing of clothes&quot;</li>
<li>Photos of nude Nuba men presented with scarcely believable context; perhaps that is their everyday habit, but other sources suggest that the nudity is related to traditional Nuba wrestling</li>
<li>Some photos of Amazon native people presented with extremely questionable context</li>
<li>Various other photos of native African and Amazonian people, which <em>Active Naturalist</em> gives me no reason to believe are typical</li>
<li>A ton of photos of native African and Amazonian people who are clothed in their genital region, but presented as if they are nude
Any further Googling just gets me shitty pop-psych articles like &quot;if we were nude guys would be horny all day duh&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any human cultures where the genitals would be exposed in daily activities? Do we know why we prefer covering our genitals?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a very excellent historical reference with a large chapter on clothing in a book written by Ruth Underhill and published by the US Department of the Interior in 1945.
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015003692897;view=1up;seq=121" target="_blank">Indians of the Pacific Northwest</a> is a full copy of the images available online. The clothing chapter begins on page 115.</p>
<p>The native people of the Pacific Northwest lived with such an abundance of food and resources within easy reach that they spent a relatively large amount of time on artwork and more elaborate craft work. Any clothes that they didn't wear therefore wasn't from a lack of available supplies or time, but strictly due to the comfort and freedom from restriction.</p>
<p>According to photos in other old journals and the reports in Underhill's book, the women wore skirts and the men wore breechclouts for practical daily life. Despite average annual temperatures in the upper 50s and low 60s, the natives from my area relied on their own body fat for warmth most of the year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sentinelese are an isolated culture living on the Sentinel Island in the indian Ocean. They have had very little contact with outsiders, and are presently protected from contact by the Indian government. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=42oZ-sWG7Zg" target="_blank">This video shows a rare interaction between an Indian anthropologist team and the tribe.</a> It’s interesting in that the tribe is seen holding their genitals in plain view, in what is probably an aggressive act. Unless you are an anthropologist, it’s probably technically NSFW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a study that correlates the divergence of body lice from head lice to the beginnings of human clothing. The theory is that there was no habitat for body lice until clothing started being used. And that head lice predate body lice.</p>

<p><em>Homo erectus</em> is generally accepted to have had clothing, basic animal fur stuff early and stitched clothing later on and their species range was from around 2 million years ago to 100,000 years ago.</p>
