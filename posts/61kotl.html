		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having run a tanning salon for 5 years, can tell you it all comes down to your skin type!  Each type has successfully more melanocytes (pigment cells) .  I'm a type three, black hair, hazel- green eyes and CAUCASIAN+American indian heritage and I tan almost the instant my skin is exposed due to  any amount of sunlight hitting the pale melanocytes in my skin - though my legs remain bright white year round unless I work to darken them.  I work in my garden every day and by summer's end I'll be very dark usually - though have never had any skin issues and normally use a very cheap Curel skin lotion right after showering.  This year for th first time in my life I've seen a couple of old age spot on my mid back - old age barnacles!   I removed them at home using Apple Cider Vinegar over a few days period, the skin under was very pale when I got done.   Human skin has specific cells place in specific areas where it is most useful to protect your body from UV harm;  like faces, shoulders, and back of arms and tops of feet.  Imagine the sun shining down directly on you from over your head... each place normally exposed to the direct UV light is where you'll tan or get burned most often. (You don't need special tanning cells under your boobs or between your legs.)   So, people tend to work on those areas in tanning salons.  Our salon recommends slow steady tanning... a burn is to be avoided, and skin checks are mandatory  WE cannot tan anyone under age 18 by state law.<br />
Skin types:    Type one is usually a fair or red head, blue eyes and few freckles and type five is usually negro with almost black skin, brow hair and eyes.<br />
yes, negro's do go to get tanned,  especially if they have low Vit D naturally in their blood.... they need more sunlight than I do to keep my Vit D levels up.  Our black ladies would come in if they have a farmer's tan from wearing shirts And shorts in the sunlight and want to be tanned all over EQUALLY. (and IN places where the sun don't shine... I've even done spray tans on these ladies with excellent results on legs, bellies, you name it.  Where ever they wanted darker or more even skin.  When I ran my salon I had the reputation as doing the best spray tans in the area... my best clients were strippers (we'd minimize some contours by reducing the liquid and maximize areas needed the most - if they had cellulite we'd work on darkening the skin (white skin shows bumps more under stage lights than dark skin)  We'd do sample testing  to see how much chemical to use  (liquid sun tan takes 4-6 hours to develop.)  I&quot;d end up doing spray tans for my clients  by appointment only.    I even had a few gay guys coming in for spray tans.   $50.00 a pop!<br />
UV radiation penetrates the tissues of our skin and can damage (mutate) the DNA of our cells. Our bodies are usually very good at repairing any DNA damage, but lengthy and regular exposure to UV can cause more damage than the body can cope with. If mutations to the DNA are left unchecked, this may change the way in which the cells behave, and they can become cancerous.  this is why we never suggest a person tan over an area that has been burned - it damages it further.
We also offered a chemical that prevented a burn from peeling! iT's not a secret...  you just have to be very careful and proceed very slowly to keep the tan, keeping the skin moisturized to prevent peeling helps.    The secret in this is citric acid.(used for canning.)<br />
I've worked with some type one's using a low pressure bed slowing increasing duration of exposure to the UV bulbs on a daily basis with a &quot;cold start&quot; bed  and these people slowly were able to get a slight tan without burning. (we also did a UV skin test with them, before starting... putting a sheet of paper with holes on it, slowly exposing the holes one at a time in sequence so that the first hole opened got the maximum time and the last hole only got 30 seconds of UV exposure.) I've seen type one's burn at 2 min's of UV exposure from hand held bulb at 12&quot; at full blast.<br />
We'd have the customers apply a tanning booster to the skin in areas they wanted to be darkest.  and a sun block to areas they wanted to protect.
Even hair can be damaged by UV rays.<br />
Seriously you know you can still get a tan thru your clothing - if your skin is moist from regular lotion.  Dry skin tends to allow the light to bounce off somewhat while tanning lotion promotes the full effect of the UV light.  Sun penetrates to the skin at about 35% depending on the fabric.  I've gotten burned thru a T-Shirt in the past and had it peel on me within a day or so after I applied an aspirin based topical to the burn area.
I've had my run-ins with people bad mouthing the tanning industry - but the almighty buck kept my business afloat at that time - I eventually sold the business at double my original costs and took a low pressure bed home with me for occasional use.  The money represents my retirement!      </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B.S in Biology but I'll try my best anyways. </p>
<p>Assuming you've read everyone's explanation of how genes play a role, I'd like to explain why these genes are present in certain individuals and answer your question as to why certain individuals burn while others don't. </p>
<p>Evolutionarily, it all comes down to how certain shades helped individuals based on their location.  It's beneficial for someone who is closer to the equator to be darker and absorb less sunlight since it's almost always readily available. In comparison to places further away from that center point where sunlight isn't as abundant throughout the day. A more pale complexion would allow you to maximize the amount of sun you take in. </p>
<p>So if your genes originated from a place where absorbing the maximum amount of sun is best and you're out in the sun for extended periods of time, you'll eventually end up burning simply because that's what the sun does when you have little protection. While others who's genes may have originated from a place with varying degrees of the sun, will be able to tan. That may be why we lose tans in the winter. Evolutionarily, tanning would be to increase your protection against the sun to not burn. The best catalyst for this reaction would of course be prolonged exposure to the sun which would be signaling extra protection needed. You would then lose this tan in the winter, or when you stop being in the sun as much, since you would need to absorb more. </p>
<p>Extra information: Since Humans as a species have been fairly good at adapting as needed, this may explain why we have lighter people in places where it'd make sense for everyone to be darker toned. Things such as umbrellas, sun block and houses would allow those with little natural protection to the sun to easily live in places where it is over abundant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The color in skin is from a pigment called melanin. Melanin protects the skin from UV rays in sunlight. Too much UV causes a sunburn. Depending on your genes, you make a mix of eumelanin (brown color) and pheomelanin (red color). The brown blocks UV best. The red can actually make the UV do more damage. Fair skinned people all look pale, but those with more pheomelanin will burn more.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the functional information we have about genes comes from mutational analyses in invertebrates.  In fruit flies for example, melanin and pigmentation has been pretty extensively studied.  The problem is 2-fold when it comes to humans:  first humans can have anywhere from two to four copies of every gene present in the &quot;blueprint genome&quot; (the fly genome), because there have been genomic duplications (i.e., duplication of the entire genome) twice throught evolution:  once before teleost fishes evolved and once after.  So there is a lot of genetic complexity involved.  And it's hard to tease apart gene function without mutational analysis, traditionally difficult in mammals with long generation times.  The second problem is that skin pigmentation is also tied to metabolic skin function.  Vitamin D production for example (critical for calcium absorption).  In warmer climates (e.g., most of Africa), skin is exposed to sunlight, and therefore able to utilize the UV irradiation of the sun for the final step of vitamin D production.  There's a tradeoff though ---- that extra sun exposure also acts as a strong selection pressure to keep melanin around, to ward off skin cancers (melanin's chief function in the skin).  In northern European populations, where climates mean the skin is doing minimal skin synthesis of Vitamin D because the sun disappears abd because clothing protects against cold---- populations have adapted by maintaining lactose tolerance beyond childhood (vitamin D is present in high concentrations in dairy products).  And because there is so much less UV irradiation, the selection pressure for maintaining upregulation of melanin disappears.  So so far, we are seeing melanin involved in protection against UV irradiation, but it is also involved in dopamine production and metabolism in the brain.  So that adds ANOTHER layer of complexity to the puzzle.  </p>
<p>In other words, it's clear that there are a lot of unanswered questions because the complexity of the issue makes it hard to get a big-picture handle on it all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale" target="_blank">The Fitzpatrick Scale</a> is used by dermatologists to label skin colors. White people, the most prone to burning of all races, can fall anywhere from 1-4 on those charts because of slightly varying genetic backgrounds. So while a person of Celtic background may burn, a person of Italian background may tan because although both people's skin may be light colored, the Celtic person's skin has less tools to deal with the sun once exposure has happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
