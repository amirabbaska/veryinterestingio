		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soda is saturated with CO2 when it's in a can highly pressurized with pure CO2.</p>
<p>When you pop open the can, this reduces the air pressure (specifically, the partial pressure of CO2). Suddenly, the soda is highly supersaturated with CO2.</p>
<p>When the CO2 comes out of solution at the surface, you don't really notice, but when CO2 comes out of solution under water, a bubble of CO2 forms. The equilibrium state is a completely flat soda (leave an opened soda out for a few days - dead flat and no bubbles).</p>
<p>But equilibrium isn't reached instantly, it takes time. You can reduce that time by creating more nucleation sites.</p>
<p>A nucleation site is an irregularity that allows a bubble to begin forming. Simmer some water and you'll see steams of bubbles forming at specific locations on the bottom of the pan. Each corresponds to a tiny scratch on the pot where the bubbles form.</p>
<p>What's interesting is a bubble is itself a nucleation site. In boiling water, you can see the bubbles growing larger as they rise.</p>
<p>Shaking a can mixes air into the soda, creating more bubbles, creating more nucleation sites, and allowing the CO2 to fall out of solution faster.</p>
<p>A mentos tablet has an extremely rough surface that also dissolves into more rough surfaces, putting ridiculous numbers of nucleation sites in the soda, allowing the soda to reach equilibrium nearly instantly. The result is all the CO2 turns to gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 dissolved in the liquid will come across any liquid gas boundary once you let the pressure out, what shaking the soda does is drastically increase the surface area available for this to happen, and spreads that surface area throughout the whole volume instead of just at the surface. If you shake a soda and then wait for the bubbles to rise back to the top of the soda before opening it, it will be just like opening a soda that hasn't been shaken.</p>
<p>Also when you open a shaken soda, the bubbles grow as they accumulate CO2, further increasing the surface area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A solvent can only hold so much solute (the thing dissolved in the solvent). Soda is pretty much maxed out for the amount of CO2 it can dissolve and maintain in equilibrium (CO2 in vapor space above liquid versus gas dissolved in liquid). Shaking adds more gas to be dissolved in the already saturated liquid (saturated meaning it can't hold more) which it can't manage causing the release of the dissolved gas. If you had a full to the brim bottle of soda, shaking would do nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of Henry's law: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law</a></p>
<p>I quote:
&quot;[...] An everyday example is given by one's experience with carbonated soft drinks, which contain dissolved carbon dioxide. Before opening, the gas above the drink in its container is almost pure carbon dioxide, at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. After the bottle is opened, this gas escapes, moving the partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid to be much lower, resulting in degassing as the dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of solution.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
