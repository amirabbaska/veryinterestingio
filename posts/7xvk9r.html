		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04" target="_blank">Here</a> is an excellent map showing accurately modeled atmospheric levels of CO2 from satellite and ground measurements taken during a year, for example.  You can easily see humans emitting it, and then forested regions sucking it up.  Unless it’s winter in that hemisphere, in which case it just swirls around until spring.  Other gas levels show similar seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>(Edit: changed to specify that it is a model based on continuous samples.  They obviously can’t sample the entire atmosphere at once every day.  And CO2 isn’t bright red.  Among other points people apparently felt necessary to clarify.)</p>
<p>(Edit again:  wow, I was not really expecting so much karma and a double-gold for this.  The question just reminded me of this cool map I once saw.  I bet it's even a repost!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <em>Measuring Metabolic Rates</em> by Dr. John RB Lighton, atmospheric levels of oxygen are incredibly stable worldwide at 20.94%. That is all locations, all altitudes and all year.</p>
<p>Of course barometric pressure will play a role due to Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures, but when compensated for you’ll get such a stable reading that you can calibrate a sensor against it.</p>
<p>The only time oxygen is much different is when measuring essentially exhaled breath. But if you get outside a confined space and away from creatures, you’re at 20.94%. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there may be a slight difference in air quality, the vast majority of Earth’s O2 supply comes from waterborne algae. So theoretically, all the trees could be cut down and we would still survive. However, trees are pretty and is like them to stay a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, oxygen levels do not noticeably change. The CO2 video, while interesting, shows changes in levels measures in parts per million - like 10 PPM between summer and winter - so no where near noticeable for human.</p>
<p>As an example, air we inhale has about 21% oxygen and we exhale about 16% oxygen (and 5% CO2). So that change is ~50,000 PPM.</p>
<p>Likewise with air quality - there are differences but nothing humans could detect. And even then human factors (like proximity to vehicle exhaust) outweigh anything natural (except fires).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most posters have focused on carbon dioxide levels, but air quality does change seasonally as well.</p>
<p>The two most important pollutants that contribute to smog in the US are ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM).  Ozone concentrations are highest in the summer, as the production of ozone is faster when there is more sunlight and higher temperatures.  Trees contribute to ozone formation by emitting isoprene and terpenes; when those compounds are photo-oxidized in the atmosphere ozone can be created.</p>
<p>Similarly, particulate matter also has seasonal variability.  Oxidation of monoterpenes can contribute to a biogenic component of PM and is important in the southeastern US.   </p>
<p>However, most of the seasonal variability in air quality is a result of changes in meteorological conditions (temperature, wind speed, humidity) and not based on changes in biogenic emissions from vegetation.  Human emissions are the root cause of most regional and urban-scale air quality issues, and our emissions tend to not vary much seasonally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
