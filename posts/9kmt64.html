<li>
<p>The rivers come from freshwater from rain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As they flow the collect very small amounts of salt from the earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They deposit that tiny amount of salt into the ocean.....over and over and over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the sun evaporates the water out of the ocean, the salt stays behind. </p>
</li>
<li>So the rivers are always replenished with fresh water from the air, but the oceans always keep the salt that has been brought to them by the rivers.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rivers ARE salty.  Slightly.  Water evaporates from the ocean, leaving whatever salt behind.  It then falls as fresh water onto the Earth.  As the water travels through and over the land, it picks up minute quantities of salt (and other minerals).  This slightly salty water accumulates as rivers which flow into the ocean, bringing salt with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 at the bottom, I'm reserving the top to debunk the most common response I've seen on this thread. </p>
<p>There are a lot of answers here already talking about how rivers are slightly salty and slowly leach salt from the land down to the ocean. While that is true, it's not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>First I'll address the problem with that explanation. </p>
<p>If salt is always moving towards the ocean, with no mechanism to remove it, then the ocean would be getting slowly saltier. If that were true, we could measure the age of the earth by the change in salinity of the oceans. People have done that, and get numbers anywhere from 300 to tens of millions of years. That range is far far smaller than the accepted value for the age of the earth, and the formation of oceans.</p>
<p>In fact, when we have found geological evidence of ancient salt content in the world's oceans it is remarkably consistent with salt levels today (outliers exist, like the Chesapeake Bay being 2x saltier). </p>
<p>So, something else is going on. The interesting thing here is that we don't actually know what that something is. </p>
<p>What we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ocean is currently salty
<ul>
<li>It has been salty for a long time</li>
<li>Rivers deposit salt into the ocean</li>
<li>Ocean salinity levels are not changing significantly </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Those facts indicate that the oceans have reached an equilibrium level of salt where the same amount of salt is added and removed over some reasonable period of time. (we've been at that equilibrium point for a very long time). </p>
<p><strong>ELI5</strong></p>
<p>Rivers pick up a tiny tiny bit of salt on their way to the ocean, and that has slowly over a really long time made the ocean very salty. </p>
<p>At the same time, the ocean is kicking out the salt, as shells and other exoskeletons, in plants' and animals' bodies, and in rocks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The river water actually isn't salty when it reaches the ocean.  Large rivers like the Mississippi or Amazon actually have a plume of fresh water at their mouths that eventually gets mixed with the ocean water.</p>
<p>In addition to what others have mentioned, salts can also come from hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
