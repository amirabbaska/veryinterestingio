		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine walking up to a pond and seeing massive ripples expanding in circles from a point. There’s no wind, and you don’t see anything else unusual, so you would infer that something (like a rock) had just fallen into the pond at the center of the circles.</p>
<p>Astronomy is like this. We really can’t see anything as it happens under normal circumstances, since things happen on enormous time scales (it took longer for Andromeda to eat a galaxy than our species has existed; probably over 100x longer). What we can do though is look at the ripples in the pond and make very careful measurements to figure out why there are ripples and the pond isn’t smooth.</p>
<p>In the case of M32, we can measure its composition (both structurally in terms of masses and types of stars and shape) and chemically (by looking at the type of light it emits/absorbs) and its size and position. We know it’s not a normal galaxy just like our rippling pond isn’t a normal pond. Things like M32 don’t just form on their own. So we infer that something else had a hand in generating this weird situation. A lot of theories, a lot of careful simulation, and more extremely careful observation later, and we have come up with a pretty decent idea of what happened.</p>
<p>We could still be wrong. Just like it might not have been a rock thrown into the pond. But it’s a really good guess. And hopefully, if we’re wrong, we’ll measure something in the future which proves it and forces us to come up with new theories and simulations and measurements. Scientists love when that happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>M32 isn't destroyed.  It's still a galaxy, but it's now an extremely compact galaxy orbiting Andromeda.  So compact that not many other observed galaxies are remotely as compact as it.  So then the question is asked how did it get so compact?  The likely answer being it is a remnant from a large collision with Andromeda.</p>
<p>To reach this conclusion they ran simulations of galaxy collisions and looked at unusual aspects of Andromeda that the simulations accounted for.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>time is the only constant and domain we are looking at/using it, with that, you can watch the stars. since we know rayleigh effect (blue and red shift), we can see group of stars move in direction x to y. and with that, map it to probably course it took before, in term of many fields we saw (like how it expand, speed it move, direction it head to, how it wooble etc) with all these. predict your next move.</p>
<p>or generally rewind that, you can tell a story.</p>
<p>this is also the method we use fo dating ice(what was the environment back in ages), on wood(same as ice), computer (splunk like big data how they correlate, machine learning) i'm not sure if deep learning use that too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
