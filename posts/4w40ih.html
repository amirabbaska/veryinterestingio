I know from my stage crew days that blue is very hard to produce well, and that the human eye is most adept to see green, and when I did my scuba class they had a chart showing the depths that colors start to fade. This got me thinking however, why does blue light penetrate further than red light in water, shouldn't the same properties of Rayleigh scattering apply?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really good question!</p>
<p>In terms of scattering, yes, blue light is scattered more easily in water and in air. However, absorption is very different for water and even water vapor.</p>
<p>In water, there is a strong preference for absorption at the lower energy red end of the visible spectrum. The reason for this can be derived from quantum chemistry. Uniquely, water gets its blue color (of course a small amount of water is colorless, but if you have a large body of water, even without the reflection of the sky, there is a blue hue as OP discovered) due to the vibrational transitions of water molecules, unlike most media which get their color from electron-based interactions such as standard absorption/emission lines, Rayleigh scattering, etc.</p>
<p>This is because water is unique in its interaction with light being primarily determined by its OH bonds, whose symmetric and antisymmetrical vibrational stretching modes are at a very unusually high energy (spatial frequency). All of this means that an overtone transition happens at (symmetric spatial freq)+3*(antisymmetric spatial freq) = 14300 cm^-1 . This corresponds to a red 698nm peak of absorption, whereas many common materials will peak in the infrared.</p>
<p>In water vapor, on the other hand, this red peak is shifted to lower energy, out of the visible range. This is again due to quantum chemistry; the relevant difference in structure between liquid and gaseous water is that hydrogen bonding is very strong in liquid water. This is why water vapor is colorless. I haven't look at what happens with air (nitrogen and oxygen), but I'm guessing they are colorless too.</p>
<p>So, basically, water is slightly blue because, unlike almost all other molecules, its strongest absorption peak is due to vibrational transitions. And these occur at 698nm - red.</p>
<p>Edit: misspoke by getting ahead of myself. thanks /u/richardmnixon42</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, Rayleigh scattering is not an absorption effect, it is as its name implies, a scattering effect.  Second, Rayleigh scattering itself only occurs when the interacting particles are smaller than the wavelength of light in question, and when they are sparsely populated.  If you create a more densely packed medium out of even Rayleigh sized particles, the effect will no longer occur because the increased amount of scattering events will average out into a unified wavefront moving in the direction of the incident light.</p>
<p>When it comes to water, the same properties of Rayleigh scattering do apply, in that it is entirely inapplicable to the situation.  Water is a much more dense material than air, especially air in the upper atmosphere where a majority of Rayleigh scattering occurs.  As a result, the Rayleigh criterion does not apply and light tends to move through water as though it were a uniform, homogeneous material.  As for why red light is absorbed and blue is not, it goes back to the other poster here that stated that water simply has absorption bands in the longer wavelengths that are able to convert red light into vibrational motion of the molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sky looks blue because of Rayleigh scattering, but the color of water isn't due to scattering: it actually <em>is</em> pale blue.  It <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png" target="_blank">absorbs red and orange light</a> and lets blue through.  The absorption overwhelms any Rayleigh scattering effect.</p>
<p>You can easily see the blue color in a swimming pool, but they usually paint the bottom blue which confuses things.  A full bathtub is just deep enough to make the blue color noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two separate and independent effects here. Blue light is preferentially scattered in the atmosphere due to the scale of fluctuations in the air and the reciprocal fourth power of the wavelength in the scattering law - materials based absorption is not involved. On the other hand absorption / transparency of water for light  of various colors is due to the molecular and atomic resonant absorptions in this specific medium due to vibrations of the electrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue light gets scattered the most in the atmosphere, that is why the sky looks blue. The exact same is true for water, except that in the atmosphere, red and green light simply passe through easier, whereas in water, red and green are absorbed more easily. Since other colors of light are absorbed, blue is the only light left that can continue to go deep, regardless of how much scattering there is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
