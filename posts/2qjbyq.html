		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your question seems to be about the physical nature and density of the sun, which seems to be getting obscured if the responses are any indication. </p>
<p>The sun isn't a gas; the sun is a ball of fusing plasma. Fusion is only occurring in the sun's core, and in that region, the density of the sun is approximately 150 times that of liquid water. Outside of the core, there is the radiative zone, where heat from the core itself- where fusion occurs, is carried outward via radiation (As in, the act of radiating energy, not the noun for radiative energy)- energy leaps from atom to atom, radiating from one atom to be absorbed by another, and then radiated again, to be absorbed again, over and over, until the radiation reaches the convective zone. In the convective zone, pressure and temperature drop sufficiently that convection cells can form- this means that hot material is heated at the edge of the radiative zone and then transported upward. It cools, condenses and then sinks back down to the edge of the radiative zone again, where it's heated...over and over. The convective zone is like a pot of boiling water on the stove with the lid on: the water boils, travels up from the surface to the condense on the lid, and eventually then condenses and runs back down into the boiling water, where it is heated back up...etc.
The &quot;surface&quot; of the sun, as you're thinking of it and that we see, is the photosphere. Now, if you were blind, there would be no photosphere. There would be no surface. Materially, the photosphere is nothing more than an isobaric point in the ever decreasing density of the solar plasma mass (i.e. the whole sun); the sun is basically just a big ball of plasma, the center of which is 150 times as dense as water, with decreasing density. The photosphere itself, however, is unique visually- it is considered the &quot;surface&quot; of the sun because &quot;above&quot; the photosphere, the solar plasma is more or less transparent to visible light and &quot;beneath&quot; it, the solar plasma is opaque. Above the photosphere is the atmosphere and the corona; for reasons that are not entirely understood, the corona is significantly hotter than the photosphere (the photosphere only being around 10,000K if I recall). </p>
<p>Now, what would happen if you &quot;crashed&quot; into the photosphere? Well, really, the sun is hot and it's dense, but if you take out the temperature piece of your assumptions, it would be similar to crashing into a liquid- though remember, this is a really, really, really tenuous comparison. A plasma is not a liquid- a plasma is what happens when all the free electrons disassociate from their atoms and so everything is free to flow and float around in a state that is at once like a liquid and also like a gas. The sun is also in hydrostatic equilibrium, which means that its own gravity is what is keeping the plasma from flying apart, as opposed to a magnetic field or something else. The sun's gravity is very strong, so you would likely &quot;sink&quot; into the sun itself (assuming your ship is a solid object). If you were entirely impervious to the heat of the sun, a few different things might happen, depending upon your density. Clearly your ship is denser than the plasma that composes the sun's surface (which is just the top of the convective zone). As such, you'd sink. Depending on how dense you are, though, you may become caught in a convective current, forever riding up and down in the convective zone. Or, if you're dense enough, you might fall through to the radiative zone. You would be freer to move here, as the material in this region is governed as much by electromagnetic and quantum effects as thermodynamic ones (like convection), but the pressures would be immense. If you were sufficiently dense, you could &quot;sink&quot; all the way down to the core; if you were more than 150 times as dense as water (i.e. the density of the core), you'd theoretically sink all the way into the center of the core. Well, technically, you would sink to the solar system's center of mass, which is near to but not exactly at the topological center of the sun due to the gravitational effects of the solar system. The reason you would sink is similar to the reason that many metals sink in water but float in mercury; you would basically sink into the sun and stop when you reached the point at which your density was equal to the density outside. </p>
<p>Again, this is all obviously discounting a lot of things (heat and pressure, mostly, but most of the interior of the sun would also be <em>dark</em>), but if you throw those things out and just consider what the &quot;consistency&quot; of the sun would be, and how an object would experience it, density of the object as compared to the density of the solar plasma body would be the primary determinants of where you stopped falling. The solar plasma body itself would basically just be like hot, gassy cake batter. </p>
<p>tl;dr - the sun itself is plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus is similar in nature to flame. The sun itself increases in density until you reach the core, which is believed to be about 150 times the density of water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The outer layers of the sun are only about as dense as water, so if you could manage to build a ship that was capable of withstanding the heat, moving through that wouldn't be too much of a problem.  However, as you pressed further into the sun, it gets more dense, up to 150 grams per cubic centimeter in the center, which is almost 20 times denser than steel.</p>
<p>That being said, the core of the sun, while dense, is still made of gas (albeit in a plasmic state), so it might be possible to push through it.  It would be like trying to sail through super-dense, extremely hot Jell-O.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>More practically: There are parts of the sun that are made out of liquids, other parts made out gases, and other parts made out of plasma. If you could survive the approach, you would splash into what is essentially a seemingly endless ocean of white-hot lava. If you survived <em>that</em> and kept going, you'd come out the <em>bottom</em> of that ocean into matter that's so hot that you've probably never actually encountered that form of matter on Earth (plasma). If you survive <em>that</em>....well, then you'd go through a gigantic fusion reaction and hit the same ocean of lava on the other side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of people are saying that the spaceship would be destroyed by high pressure or temperature. But I think OP is asking if theoretically you flew an indestructible object into the sun, would you come out the other side, or would you hit another physical object that stops your movement forward. I would love to know the answer. </p>
<p>Also, would you be able to fly through gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn given the same circumstances? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did anyone in the comments section actually read the question? The ship in the scenario is completely invulnerable to damage, it can't be burned, irradiated, or crushed by gravity, and the pilot can't be killed. The question is, has the sun got a solid surface you could crash into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
