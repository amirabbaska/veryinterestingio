My problem, however, is getting distracted by my phone and just sitting there after the business is done thus causing tingling legs. Guess that's more of a personal problem though. I could have googled but thought of y'all instead- take that how you want. (:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The toilet seat puts pressure on the nerves leading to your legs by allowing your butt to sink into the giant hole in the middle. This puts the bottom of your femur (thigh) under a lot of pressure, when that area would normally not be because our butts are designed to carry fat to protect our sacrum (tailbone) and the nerves that go through it/ around it. What happens is essentially the same thing as if you were to lean on one arm for too long- it's not so much a blood flow issue, although that can contribute in a minor way, but rather the compression of nerves. </p>
<p>We discussed this in a class in my nursing program (I'm studying to be a registered nurse) because they make a pillow referred to as a &quot;donut.&quot; It's supposed to help older adults feel more comfortable in a hospital bed, (especially because they don't have butt fat anymore) but instead it has the same effect as sitting on the toilet for hours on end. Companies try to market it to prevent pressure ulcers on patient's rear ends, but it's actually bad for them. </p>
<p>Now you know! </p>
<p>Edit: wow guys! Thanks for all the upvotes, and your wonderful comments :) </p>
<p>Other users have pointed out the actual muscles and nerves involved: the toilet seat puts pressure on the piriformis muscle, which then compresses the sciatic nerve. That nerve compression is what causes the unpleasant feeling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doc here, I know it's late but here's an actual explanation:</p>
<p>The feeling that you get is due to what we call neuropraxia, which is the mildest form of nerve injury. When you sit on a regular chair, your weight is distributed primarily on your ischial tuberosity(i.e. &quot;sit bones&quot;) and other soft tissue meant for weight-bearing. When you sit on a toilet seat, the weight shifts to where it's putting your weight onto your sciatic nerves(the major nerve in your leg).</p>
<p>This compression of the nerve causes this mild, reversible nerve injury and is responsible for the &quot;falling asleep&quot; feeling you experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>same amount of weight, smaller surface area. you know how a bed of nails works? if all of your body was on one nail, that one nail would hold all of your weight and poke into you with all of your weight. (this has a name: normal force is the force that pushes you back when you push on something.) on a bed of nails, you're suspended on many, many nails, and even though theyre ALL sharp, each nail only holds a tiny fraction of your weight, so it pokes into you less.</p>
<p>(also the reason snowshoes work. more surface area &gt; each inch of snow is holding less of ur weight and is less likely to crumble.)</p>
<p>so, all of ur body weight is on the seat of the toilet, so a larger fraction of ur weight is on each inch of rim, because there's less seat, so it's &quot;poking&quot; you more. where a normal chair has more even weight distribution. more force on each inch of ur body &gt; more likely itll fall asleep.</p>
<p>(ive also had my butt fall asleep after sitting on a chair for a looong time. it just takes longer.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever had someone sit on your lap and thought, &quot;wow, they have a boney butt!&quot;  What you're feeling are the ischial tuberosities, the lowest part of a bone of the pelvis.  When sitting on a flat surface (in this case a chair) these boney projections prop up the body away from the nerves that run from the spinal cord down into the legs (the sciatic nerves).</p>
<p>Because the ischial tuberosities of the pelvis are fairly centrally located, when sitting on a toilet seat they don't prop up the body - and as a result you compress the sciatic nerves.  Nerves really don't like to be pinched, pulled, or compressed.  I think everyone has &quot;hit their funny bone&quot; enough to understand this quite nicely.</p>
<p>Note: the reason the answer to this question has nothing to do with blood flow is that the main blood supply to the lower limbs are from the femoral arteries, which are located on the front of the legs, not the back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toilet seat has a rim. Smaller surface area means it presses on your legs with higher force. So has higher tendency to slow down blood going into your legs. Regular chairs on the other hand are flat, have higher surface area, so less pressure, and less force pressing on your legs. So less tendency to slow blood flow.
Edit: the comment below me corrected me. The higher force  presses  on the nerves, not blood flow. thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
