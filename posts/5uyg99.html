		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons I see. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same station are used for long-distance/international train and regional/suburban train.  You do not want to deal with security checkpoints in your daily commute. You could imagine putting checkpoints only on long-distance train, but then why not the regional/suburban trains ? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A train can in a few minutes go to a <em>safe</em> position. Simply hit the breaks, usually the driving system implies a <em>dead man switch</em> and if the driver stop to hold it train will automatically send alarm to the regulation and stop.   Even high-speed-trains pass trough backup station where they can stop if anything goes wrong (it's always easier to have an ambulance and the police coming to a station than having them walking 500m trough a muddy field. )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't have to deal with the difference of pressure, a bomb exploding in a train will cause serious damages an dozen of deads for sure but it won't fully destroy the train and most of the passenger will leave the train on their feet. The same in a plane and even a small blast will destroy the plane due to the difference of pressure (as punching a balloon with a niddle) killing everybody on-board. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in the commercial battle rail vs air. The fact that you can arrive at the station 5 minutes before your train, be on the platform 2 minutes later and catch your train on time is a serious asset that train companies will try to keep. </p>
</li>
<li>(At least in Europe, I saw this in France/Germany/Belgium). For international train it's not that uncommon to see the border police/custom patrolling the train, checking passengers ids and having their dog smelling the bags (especially in the train from Asterdam to Paris). In a train with 500 persons on board it's easy to fit 2 policemen and their dog inside. They don't even need a seat. </li>
</ul>
<p>That said, after the failed attack in a Train between Brussels and Paris, I started to see metal detector and luggage-scanner for train too.  I already told reddit the day I thought they where getting crazy on terrorism security until I saw the head of the European and his bodygards leaving the same train. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big reasons is hijacking. If you hijack a plane you can go anywhere in the world you want as long as you have enough fuel onboard. With a train you can not choose your destinations. You go where the rails go. Planes are also really fast compared to trains.</p>
<p>One other reason to hijack a plane is to use it as ammunition. A train obviously can not be used in such way. You can go at full speed and try to derail the train but that's it. You can't drive it into certain building. But you can fly a plane everywhere or AT anything.</p>
<p>Other thing to remember is that train is much harder to hijack and control. A train can be really really long and have many passenger wagons. All it takes is one person to pull the emergency brake and the train stops. After that the doors open and everybody can run off. At most you are looking at a hostage situation in the middle of the forest. Pretty pointless hijacking unless hostage situation is the exact thing you want. For political reasons this could be an option.</p>
<p>So trains are simply far less useful for any kind of reason whereas planes are excellent for the exact same reasons. A train at most has to deal with bomb threats which in reality is not really good option for the bomber. If you want to inflict mass damages train is not good target. As such it is hard to justify spending tons of money on train security when there is no point even for anyone to make any kind of attack using a train as a target or tool for causing damage. </p>
<p>Planes also are very expensive and even if you don't lose the plane the downtime is super expensive if a hostage situation occurs for example. If you lose the plane and the passengers then it is a massive pr issue for you as a corporation. If a bomb attack happens in train you don't lose the whole train. Not only is the train and the wagons really robust but any kind of damage is limited only to the wagon where the bomb went off and the train wagons that derailed. Train tracks themselves can be fixed relatively quickly unless we are talking about really really big bombs.</p>
<p>tl:dr. Trains are just really poor targets. Planes on the other hand is the best kind of target you can imagine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Security on planes hasn't always been so tight either, my nan had a story she loved to tell about how she went on holiday to france in the 70's (I think) and couldn't find her passport at the airport so they just let her go on the plane and told her to make sure she had it out at the other side as they might not be happy if she didn't.  At the other end they didn't ask her for it when getting off, or back on to go home.  </p>
<p>They asked for it on return to england and she told them she thinks she left it at home, so they just let her go though anyway.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking was very common in the 60s and 70s. There were 130 hijackings in the US between '68 and '72, around 1 a week. Airport security became a thing after that.</p>
<p>After 9/11, hijacking became seen a very dangerous instead of just annoying, so security got stepped up again.</p>
<p>Train hijacking in the USA isn't a thing, so no security. In France I did notice armed guards at the train stations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most Chinese train stations have a security, airport style:</p>

<p>They tend to be less strict than the airport though.</p>
<p>Even subway stations have a scanner:</p>

<p>The lack of security checks at train stations is a regional thing, not universal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
