		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thunderstorms require a lot of warm, moist air moving up while a lot of cold, dry air is moving down. The warm air gets high enough that water droplets condense and make big clouds. The more air moving around, the bigger the cloud. The lightning comes from a build up of static electricity from the different air currents moving against each other. </p>
<p>If it's snowing, chances are there isn't enough warm air to form the right conditions. Snow requires cold, moist air. Dry air is much better at forming static electricity, and there generally aren't masses of air moving against each other when all the air is cold, like there would be if some was warm and some was cold. </p>
<p>Hail can often coincide with thunderstorms, however, because it's formed differently. When all that air is moving upwards, it can create some extremely powerful updrafts. Sometimes they're strong enough to push water high enough for it to freeze into hail before falling down again, even if it's much warmer down near the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thunderstorms are typically caused by a warm lower layer in the atmosphere pushing up against a colder upper layer. Usually this is caused by extreme temperature drops, say humid and 90's during the day then still humid and 50's at night. That 40 degree temperature difference creates havoc in the atmosphere. Typically with snow conditions you aren't having temperature swings that drastic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The short answer? &quot;In the summer there's a lot more moisture in the air&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any thunderstorm requires moisture, instability, and some mechanism for lifting, such as a front. It is harder to get all of these to come together in the winter,&quot;
says Yvette Richardson, assistant professor of meteorology at Penn State.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just looked it up because I was curious, so maybe you will get a better answer. But from what I can tell it has to do with air currents being more stable during the winter as everything is cold so there isn't the displacement between hot and cold air which is typical of a thunderstorm. There is what is called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundersnow" target="_blank">thundersnow</a> which is what you are asking about, so it does happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
