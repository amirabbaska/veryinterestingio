		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A seizure occurs when there is out-of-control electrical activity in your brain. A seizure can take many forms, ranging anywhere from an involuntary muscle twitch, to &quot;blanking out,&quot; to losing consciousness and convulsing on ground uncontrollably (which most people think of when they hear the word &quot;seizure&quot;). Seizures can take many forms because they have many causes.  They can be focal (i.e. propagating from one area of the brain, such as with a brain tumor or a brain bleed), or can be global (seizure activity everywhere in the brain at once, such as with metabolic disturbances).</p>
<p>If you suspect somebody has a seizure, the first diagnostic test to get is an EEG (electroencephalogram), which is essentially an EKG for the brain. It graphs the electrical activity of the brain. A trained neurologist can interpret normal brain wave activity and differentiate it from possible seizure activity. If you are certain that there is seizure activity, you get an MRI to look for any structural abnormalities that can cause seizures (trauma, tumors, AV malformations, etc).</p>
<p>Seizures are treated in many different ways. Ideally, you treat the underlying cause (get rid of the tumor, correct the metabolic abnormality, etc), but sometimes this isn't possible. You can also treat them with medications called anti-epileptic drugs. There are many AED's, with different mechanisms of action and different side effects (agitation, suicidal ideations, dizziness, risk of taking when pregnant). Choosing the right AED can be tricky, because you have to know what type of seizure you're treating, and weigh the risk of side effects with the benefit of hopefully stopping the seizures.</p>
<p>Almost everyone will have a seizure at some point in their life, and most of us don't remember having one. Needless to say, not everybody is on an AED. We reserve treatment for people who have had multiple seizures (epilepsy), or are at risk of having multiple seizures.</p>
<p>Identifying triggers and avoiding them is a must (avoiding sleep deprivation, bright/flashing lights, etc). Ketogenic diets have also been found to be beneficial in reducing seizure activity in some patients. Also, patients with epilepsy must know how to avoid certain activities in case they have a seizure while doing them (driving, climbing ladders, cooking with gas, stepping into bath tubs).</p>
<p>If you see somebody that you suspect is actively seizing, the best thing to do is give them room, keep others back, and call 911. Do NOT try and hold them down, and do NOT stick anything in their mouth. It is a common misconception that people with seizures will swallow their tongue. This is physically impossible.</p>
<p>Epilepsy is a very common neurologic disorder. Fortunately, we live in a time where we have so many different ways to treat seizures. New medicines are being invented all the time. Vimpat, for example, was just approved by the FDA 8 years ago, and is now used in hospitals all around the United States. We still have a long ways to go, but we're making great progress in treating epilepsy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>here's a scenario:
-normal person's brain = quiet and organized students in a classroom
-person brain during epilepsy = detention room with students that were given sugar and everyone is all over the place and crazy and no one can control them.</p>
<p>basically, what happens in a person's brain during epilepsy, is the neurons go haywire and crazy your body is somewhat mimicking what's happening in your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has actually explained what happens to your body and brain when you have a seizure. </p>
<p>The neurons in your brain are constantly firing small electrical signals and impulses at different rates and times. When you have a seizure, these signals begin to fire at the same time, creating large excitatory waves that can spread throughout the brain. Depending on where in your brain the seizure is, your body will be affected differently. If it is in your motor strip, those signals may travel down through your body, causing focal convulsions or shaking. If the electrical activity spreads to both hemispheres of the brain or &quot;generalizes&quot; you lose consciousness and can have bilateral shaking, or what we usually call a generalized or grand mal seizure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know as a respiratory therapist that your bicarb drops considerably post-ictal (the afterglow of the seizure) .  No one knows why and everyone seems to recover shortly after.  But doctors keep ordering those ABGs (tests I have to do to show the drop), then act puzzled, then treat the seizure like they would have without ordering the ABG.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain functions with electrical impulses and chemicals. When you have a seizure the electrical impulses fire abnormally which is like a lightning storm in your head. Depending on which region of your brain they are doing the firing mind you it confuses it'self and it makes you have a seizure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
