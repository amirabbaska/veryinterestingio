		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is: <strong>it depends, but probably, yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Problem is, no lab experiments of gorillas + spiders show up. </p>
<p>Our next best bet is by inference: evidence of similar 'fears'
Carel Van Shaik (a famous primatologist) argues that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3oCbCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;ots=2r7lXEmesn&amp;dq=%20gorilla%20arachnophobia%20evolution&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=arachnophobia&amp;f=false" target="_blank">having 'fears'  like arachnophobia and ophidiophobia would be adaptive</a> (e.g., you avoid, you live and make babies vs the fearless dead). In the period 50 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Mya" target="_blank">MYA</a> to 1MYA, were spiders enough of a threat that fearing them would benefit you? Some researchers argue &quot;yes.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>But how do we fear such threats?</strong>
I think this is the more interesting question. I noticed that in certain parts of Europe and the Galapagos, birds that are elsewhere skittish are shamelessly tame. Regarding most &quot;ancient fears,&quot; It seems we are <strong>hard-wired to respond to templates and certain movements</strong>. <a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~rakison/Infant_Cognition_Lab/publications/LoBue,%20Rakison,%20&amp;%20DeLoache%20\(2010\).pdf" target="_blank">Babies and Rhesus monkeys shown videos of snakes recognize them much much quicker than other objects</a>. This ultra-rapid recognition is important as it suggests the recognition machinery resides somewhere in our lower,  &quot;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4406946/" target="_blank">lizard brain</a>&quot;. Patterns in our lower brain are more immediate and we learn from them faster than patterns we store in our cerebral cortex (I'm oversimplifying here to keep this explanation from being 10 pages).</p>
<p>So this suggests we are not programmed to fear, but are programmed from deep in our 'lizard brains' to react quickly to certain movements (darting, slithering, jumping) and to certain templates (lots of legs or no legs) very fast. For gorillas, this would suggest <strong>gorillas that didn't see spiders growing up would not fear them, but could quickly learn to fear them if some big bad spider creeped up to them</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of comments conflating snakes and spiders in this thread (even many of the sourced comments). There are very few spiders that are dangerous to gorillas (I'm basing this off spiders venomous to humans, I have never seen a report of a gorilla suffering from a spider bite), and from a quick search, I can't find any significant venomous spiders that share their range with gorillas. While widow spiders are in Africa, black widows do not appear to be present in areas wild gorillas are found. Brown widows, which are very docile and <a href="http://spiders.ucr.edu/brownwidow.html" target="_blank">unlikely to inject appreciably dangerous venom</a>, <a href="https://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/URBAN/SPIDERS/brown_widow_spider.htm" target="_blank">may be within gorilla ranges</a>. For that reason, I would be surprised if wild gorillas have a developed fear of spiders. It's also worth noting that spiders may be a normal part of a gorilla diet. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17902166" target="_blank">Chimpanzees and gorillas both eat a wide variety of insects</a>, and while gorillas have not been reported to eats spiders in literature (in my brief look) chimpanzees certainly have, and there are many anecdotal reports of a variety of monkeys and apes eating spiders. </p>
<p>I am highly suspicious of the idea that snakes and spiders can be conflated, due to their significant differences in risks. There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Snakes_of_Africa" target="_blank">many more dangerous snakes than spiders</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10673460" target="_blank">humans overestimate how dangerous spiders are, and how often they bite</a>. </p>
<p>Edit: Added some extra links and fixed some grammar. Let me know if these sources aren't good enough, there are plenty more where they come from.</p>
<p>Another edit: Compared to spiders, snakes are well known to attack and harm primates, especially baby primates. A quick google search will pull up both venomous and nonvenomous snakes attacking various primates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1zHKmMNTg4" target="_blank">(here's a video of some even)</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
