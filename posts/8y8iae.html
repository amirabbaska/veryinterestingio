Names do not change as often and can persist for thousands of years. Even if there are no historical records the name itself often refers to what was there. To find the exact site to dig you often does have some remaining features in the landscape from the buildings and such. Even if there are no remaining features above ground you can often look at the landscape and see what the best location to place something is which will give you a pretty good guess. Ground penetrating radar often gives you are very inconclusive result as it can only see vague patterns and features underground. It does not tell you what those features are made by, how old they are or if they are indeed made by man. And often aerial studies using radar or infrared cameras can tell you about similar features and is much faster. But to really find out what is at a site you have to dig a trench and look for things. Most of the time archaeological sites are stumbled upon by accident by locals or when doing construction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accident is a popular one. Hitting stuff while disrupting the ground, whether for construction or plowing a field, is a tried and true method. If the people who make the find are curious or civic-minded enough to report it, it can then be checked out and assessed.  </p>
<p>Studying old documents is another. If you know where some places are, and have contemporary documentation talking about some other place you're interested in but haven't located, you might be able to roughly triangulate a place to look. If it's recorded as being three days from point A, two days from point B, and near geographic feature C, you can make some educated guesses.  </p>
<p>These days, aerial and satellite imagety has become more and more useful. From an plane, one might be able to see patterns in crops caused by differences in soil resulting from buried structures (<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099195-aerial-pictures-reveal-englands-ancient-archaeological-sites/" target="_blank">this has been used recently in Britain</a>). A LIDAR scan of a jungle might reveal temples hidden under the canopy (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/mayan-pyramids-1.4519863" target="_blank">Here's an article about a Mayan site so discovered</a>). Satellite imagery meanwhile can show differences in density of the soil, revealing old road networks and waterways (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/using-space-satellites-to-spot-ancient-cities-159720572/" target="_blank">a technique being used for Middle Eastern sites</a>).</p>
<p>Also, like you suggested, GPR is a method, though that is typically not coming in to play until you already know something is there, and are just trying to narrow down specifically where to dig. It's not a practical tool for initial discovery.</p>
<p>EDIT:
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44806069" target="_blank">This was actually in the news today</a>, because of extreme heat causing crops to reveal buried ruins in Wales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US land used for construction that has any amount of federal funding must undergo an archaeological survey. We call this a phase one and dig what’re called shovel test pits or STPs based on some predetermined methodology. The holes are dug by hand and the material is pushed through the 1/8” screens. The holes are generally 30x30x80-100 (varies by client). Digging stops if a level identified by geomorphologists is determined to be subsoil or bedrock.  The minimum requirement of Section 106 is to have the holes no more than 30m apart from each other and they must cover the entirety of the project area. 15m intervals are required for areas identified as high probability. </p>
<p>GPR is a highly useful tool in archaeology but the majority of US archaeological field work is what we call CRM (cultural resource management) and has to bid on contracts and fit within their budget. Most of these companies very rarely use GPR and almost exclusively only use it after some initial discovery has been made and additional money has been allocated to further survey the project area. Using GPR to survey large areas isn’t cost of time efficient and it’s difficult to operate GPR in difficult terrain. Operating GPR is similar to pushing a weighted baby stroller. It’s necessary to clear brush over large areas to access most isolated areas with GPR etc etc etc. GPR will also give very many false positives and frequently identify many anomalies that turn out to be natural changes in soil density</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres quite a few ways:</p>
<p>1) survey- finding some random artifacts/bones/stone tools on the surface in a concentration high enough to warrant further investigation. Usually this is done by local field technicians or bone hunters who then contact an archaeologist to do more work.</p>
<p>2) geological survey: if one archaeologist found a site/artifact/etc. at a certain rock layer people will check other places that have that same rock layer (strata) for artifacts/bones/etc. </p>
<p>3) floods/construction/high erosion areas: help uncover a lot of dirt/sand and can reveal all kinda of things</p>
<p>4) water: people tend to live near water for a bunch of reasons! looking at where the water level used to be for the time frame you are looking at, gives you a better chance at finding a site. </p>
<p>5) Drones/Google Maps: extremely rare but some archaeologists check google earth for monumental architecture </p>
<p>6) Migration patterns: if we find a type of pottery/stone tool in one area and the same kind of pottery/stone tool (same shape/decoration/materials/etc.) then somewhere in between may be another site. Archaeologists will try to find paths that make sense (once again near water or paths where cattle could pass- depends on your time frame)</p>
<p>*Archaeologists also dig test pits if they find a concentration of interesting materials. Depending on the finds they can be expanded into full blown trenches</p>
<p>*Ground penetrating radar (GPR) can help find sites but are really only used when theres a level of certainty that a site is close by. GPR is expensive and time consuming! </p>
<p>TL;DR: Finding archaeological sites can seem random and based entirely on luck from an outside perspective. In reality it is a well thought out process based on previous research, general human behavior and surface finds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
