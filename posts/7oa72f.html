<p>Edit:
Thank you everyone
Bit of context
I know high school physics but I am a bit of a physics buff and know some quantum stuff but not really the maths about it</p>
<p>I'm interested in exploring the idea that photons transmit information of the field to particles and roughly of you could create those photons without having a field?</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for the amazing replies</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As said below, there are field configurations (say your good ol' horseshoe magnet) that are static (=dont change in time). Those are not radiation. They are still connected to photons in super mathy descriptions (quantum field theory), but there is no picture known to me or anyone i know that is both intuitive and accurate. </p>
<p>Those force carrier particles (gauge bosons) usually cause a lot of confusion because things tend to get interpreted too literally.</p>
<p>If you would be so kind as to state your rough level of knowledge and context, id be happy to provide a suitable answer, but i fear of going overly simplified or way to pedantic if i dont know where you are coming from</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is a bit strange. Maybe you could tell us the context where you were reading this, and also if you are asking this for a particular reason or application.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves (radiation) are a strange thing. They can be thought of as waves, but if you study them you realize they carry energy in discrete amounts, which are photons.</p>
<p>Now, static electric and magnetic fields, as studied in a first Physics course in university are not waves, are not radiation; they are not related to photons. Once these two fields are combined, and you get time varying fields, then you start talking about radiation, waves, and photons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all electric and magnetic field configurations contain radiation. For example static fields donâ€™t contain any radiation. Radiation requires time dependence of the fields. For a pointlike source, the radiation parts of the electric and magnetic fields are proportional to 1/r, where r is the distance from the source to the observation point. When you calculate the momentum flux through a surface at infinity, only terms that fall off as 1/r or slower survive. So these are the only parts of the field which can carry energy to infinity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know from Maxwell and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction" target="_blank">Faraday's</a> work that 1) electric current can induce a magnetic field, and 2) a rotating magnet can induce current. The magnitude of the electromagnetic radiation associated with either process can be measured as the frequency of oscillation of the outward particles. However, I don't understand what you mean by &quot;type&quot; of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>To answer the second question, you are &quot;transmitting&quot; photons every time you turn on a flashlight, and those photons have momentum that imparts a force onto whatever matter the photons encounter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I interpret your question you can't send particles only associated with the electric or magnetic field because photons carry information about changes in the electric and magnetic field and you can't change only either one without also doing something to the other. They are coupled together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
