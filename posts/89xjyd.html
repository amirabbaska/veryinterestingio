		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're focusing, you're engaging the parts of your brain that handle step-by-step tasks like math. Creative efforts take specific skills to do, like drawing is a fine motor skill, but to get the ideas for that creative effort you have to use the parts of your brain that handle things like daydreaming. The daydreamy parts of your brain basically turn off when you're focused on a step-by-step type of task (unless it's a very very boring task that you've done so much you could do it with your eyes closed, like putting boxes together or folding clothes).</p>
<p>Basically, your brain is kind of like a computer that can do your taxes and can play video games but it can't run the video games if the taxes program is already running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've thought about this as well, and it reminds me of when I was in the military.  When people are learning how to march, you're told to have your arms swing in the opposite direction as your feet (i.e., left foot forward, right arm back).  This is what people do anyway, but once they start trying to control it they end up screwing it up.</p>
<p>Maybe the 'creative muscle' isn't really autonomic and it can't be effectively flexed at will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being creative is an open ended task. It has no structure. Its a huge goal but no defined path to get there. Imagine trying to solve a equation that you don't understand. Or translating a language you have no reference for. You don't even know where to start and the enormity of what you're trying to do hits you. Its why planning is so important. Its much easier to break tasks down into smaller sections. If you can define smaller tasks within the greater task then you'll have a much better time. As you do other tasks you're thinking, your mind is still working and you're not drowning in the futility of trying to 'be creative'. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
