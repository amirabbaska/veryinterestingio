		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally beverages were carbonate via fermentation, which produces CO2 as the yeast or bacteria eat some of the sugars. Some beverages still are done this way, such as beer. CO2 is still used because it's cheap and adds the acidic flavour. Some of the CO2 in the drink forms carbonic acid. </p>
<p>Air couldn't be used because it contains oxygen, which will allow for the beverage to spoil. Other gases can be used though. Guinness beer for example uses a mix of CO2 and nitrogen, giving it a more foamy head. </p>
<p>In general, for a gas to be used for &quot;carbonation&quot;, it would need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>not cause the food to spoil (which is pretty much just oxygen)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not cause some sort of undesirable chemical reaction with the beverage. CO2 will make some carbonic acid which is fine, but others may make more of worse chemicals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not have any negative odour or taste. You wouldn't want sulfur based gases that smell like rotten eggs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they would obviously need to readily dissolve in water. Helium for example would probably work fine, if you could actually get it to dissolve as well as CO2. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I suppose I should add on not be flammable would be nice too, as even if methane (aka natural gas) or hydrogen could work, they would also be a little dangerous.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also in the extreme, you wouldn't want it being poisonous. We add a little chlorine to water to kill bacteria, but you wouldn't want a rupture of chlorine coming out of a beverage or it will kill you. Lots of other toxic gases you wouldn't want in there. </p>
</li>
<li>Again in the extreme end, you wouldn't want the gas to be a environmental issue. Something like SF6 may very well work, but you wouldn't exactly want a lot of that getting into the atmosphere. </li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of gases wouldn't work for one of these reasons or another. I'm sure there's some other gas out there other than CO2 and to a lesser extent N2, they however most likely wouldn't be as cheap and easy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 really is special!  Most gases just dissolve in water, drifting around among the water molecules and not doing much. But CO2 <em>reacts</em> with water! *</p>
<pre><code> CO2 + H2O --&gt; CO3(--) + 2 H(+)</code></pre>
<p>This forms carbonate (CO3) ions, and also a lot of free hydrogen ions (H+).  Water with extra H+ ions is an <em>acid</em>: adding CO2 makes the water more acidic, which is why carbonated water tastes sour.</p>
<p>This reaction also gets rid of the dissolved CO2 in the water, allowing <em>even more</em> CO2 to dissolve into the water, and get reacted, and so on, until eventually a balance is reached.</p>
<p>The net result is that you can put about <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gases-solubility-water-d_1148.html" target="_blank">25-50</a> times as much CO2 into water as you can an ordinary gas!  If you put the gas in at high pressure, it will bubble out when you open the container, and that means that adding CO2 gives a much bubblier drink thank other gases.</p>
<p>There are a few other gases that react with water like this (for example hydrogen chloride), and they also have very high solubilities, but they'll kill you if you drink them.</p>
<p>(*) This reaction is simplified, but good enough for ELI5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is highly soluble in water. From memory, a given volume of water at 25 C can dissolve around 400 times its own volume of CO2. Most of the other common, non toxic gases are far less soluble. Nitrogen, oxygen, argon and other commonly used gases have very poor solubility in water. You may want to have a look at these solubilities:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is due to the solubility of CO2 in water. 3 grams of CO2 (1.6 litres) can dissolve in 1 litre of water, at normal atmospheric pressure. Increase the pressure, and you can dissolve 10x that. </p>
<p>Compare this to other gases: 0.025 grams of nitrogen (20 ml) in 1 litre of water; 0.0015 grams of helium ( 10 ml) in 1 litre of water. </p>
<p>The reason for this is that the CO2 actually reacts with the water. Some other gases also react with water and are highly soluble (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide) but these are all highly toxic.</p>
<p>Other gases are used, when CO2 doesn't have the necessary solubility - for example, because the liquid you are trying to make &quot;fizzy&quot; is very fatty/oily. A good example of this is &quot;self-whipping cream&quot;. Whipped cream is just cream with air/gas bubbles stuck in it. If you can dissolve gas in cream, then when you remove it from the bottle, then it will self-whip. </p>
<p>In this case, you need a gas which is highly soluble in edible fats - for which the best choice is nitrous oxide (N2O).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
