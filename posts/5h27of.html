		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>ELI5:</strong> (a) Humans and rice have roughly the same amount of genes, the difference is the ratio of genome length:genes, (b) rice has less non-coding sequences compared to humans. And no, (c) rice isn't more advanced than humans and humans aren't more advanced than rice, evolution isn't a goal-oriented process, therefore, you can't say that an organism is more advanced than other one.</p>
<hr />
<p>Excellent question and also a common misconception.</p>
<p>There are two things to tackle: (a) how genes work and (b) biological complexity and (c) evolution.</p>
<p><strong>On genes</strong></p>
<p>DNA is made of a large sequence of molecules called <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Difference_DNA_RNA-EN.svg/350px-Difference_DNA_RNA-EN.svg.png" target="_blank">nucleic acids</a>, there are four of them: Adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Sequences of nucleic acids make up genes, genes -along with some other non-coding sequences- make chromosomes, and chromosomes make the genome.</p>
<p>As an analogy, think of genes like words. Some words have only one meaning, but some words have more than one meaning, some words have a different meaning depending the context, some words mean different things in different parts of the world, etc. The same goes for genes.</p>
<p>In the most simple level, a single gene codes for a single protein which has a single use. But genes and non-coding sequences work in more complex ways. There are genes that can code for more than one protein depending on the environment, are genes that code only for a part of a protein (there are proteins that need more than one gene to be coded), there are genes that don't code for anything, but regulate the coding of other genes. As you can see, there's a complex network on how genes work, it isn't a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>On complexity</strong></p>
<p>It's easy to be mislead into thinking that &quot;larger DNA sequence&quot; equals &quot;more complex gene&quot;, but that isn't the case. Something interesting is that the <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/6/1107/F1.expansion.html" target="_blank">length of a gene is highly preserved within eukaryotes</a> (cells with nucleus), which means that, the larger your DNA sequence, the more genes you will have (<a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/6/1107.full" target="_blank">from this paper</a>). </p>
<p>Let's compare the size of the human genome (coding+non-coding) vs the size of the rice genome. Humans have 23 chromosomes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome#Coding_sequences_.28protein-coding_genes.29" target="_blank">~40k protein-coding genes</a> and a length of 6,469.66M base pairs (Mb) when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy#Diploid" target="_blank">diploid</a> (2n).</p>
<p>On the other hand, rice has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organisms_by_chromosome_count" target="_blank">24 chromosomes</a>, <a href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/" target="_blank">~39k genes</a>, 1620.31 Mb when diploid.</p>
<p>So, there's only a difference of one chromosome, they have roughly the same amount of genes but the difference comes in the length of the genome.</p>
<p>That means that rice has a more straightforward system, with less non-coding sequences, compared to human genome.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> On evolution</strong></p>
<p>A big misconception in biological evolution is to think that an organism is more advanced than other one, just because one of them has a greater apparent complexity (more structures, larger genome, etc.). The problem here is that evolution isn't a process with a goal, evolution isn't trying to achieve a more complex or more advanced state, evolution is only the process where organisms change from generation to generation.</p>
<p>All the organisms have been evolving for the same time, since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor" target="_blank">all the organisms raised from the same event</a>. We're all &quot;equally advanced&quot; but we have evolved to different environments and we have different evolutive history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number of genes isn't what determines complexity, it's how those genes are used. Imagine the same principle with language. If you try to describe something simple with thousands of words, your description isn't more complex than a short and precise one. To oversimplify: In plants, 10 genes might do 10 different things. In mammals those 10 different things could be done with 1 gene. It's the context in which the gene is used that determines what it does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants in general tend to have a lot more genes than animals. It's not known for sure why, but some people think that this is because plants are fixed in their locations. </p>
<p>Plants are stuck in place so they have to deal with whatever conditions that they experience. On the other hand, when animals like you, are exposed to conditions you don't like (such as extremes of heat), you can move away from them, and you can seek out the right amount of things you do need (like the right amount of water and salt).</p>
<p>Genes code for proteins, and when conditions are different, you need different proteins. By having larger genomes, plants have more options for ways to respond to different conditions. </p>
<p>For instance, plants can synthesize everything they need from only a tiny handful of simple raw ingredients, whereas animals need to eat plants or other animals to get what they need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One element of this is that humans are mammals, and so have our body temperature (and to some extent nutrient intake) controlled within specific limits. We are also kept in a regulated environment (womb) until most of our basic development has been completed.</p>
<p>In the simplest sense, genes encode information, and you need a lot more information to deal with a variable situation.</p>
<p>For example, a set of human genes might say &quot;make protein X, when protein X gets to this level, start breaking down protein X and produce protein Z&quot;. </p>
<p>For rice, that will need to say &quot;if you are growing and there is water make protein X, otherwise make protein Y, unless the temperature is too cold, in which case break down protein X and Y and make protein Z instead. If you have no sunlight then stop making any of these proteins and if nutrient X is available make all of them&quot;. </p>
<p>So although I wouldn't say that rice is more advanced, I would say that it has a more complicated genome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
