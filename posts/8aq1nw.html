		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explosives are categorized by burn rate. High explosives (high burn rate explosives) provide a quick “punch” that are good for shattering rock etc but don’t scatter a lot of material. Burying high explosives in the sand would do almost nothing when detonated.
Low burn rate explosives have a large gas expansion which tends to move lots of material. Setting these off underground would lift the dirt and create a large crater.  Setting off a low burn rate explosive in rock would tend to scatter large chunks instead of shattering the rock into small pieces.
High explosives are good for surgical strikes where the destruction need to be contained in a small area. Slow burn explosives are more likely to damage surrounding buildings and cause more collateral damage.
The bombs to which you are referring use ANFO explosives which are of the slow burning type. This is a common explosive in construction and excavation where large amounts of material need to be moved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, barrel bombs are only really good at killing noncombatants in cities.  They work well on military bases and in confined combat areas, too, but in cities they mostly kill civilians.</p>
<p>They don't penetrate armor or break defenses.  They just make everything burn and make the area uninhabitable for anyone not in a military vehicle or a bunker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the technology is especially horrible, it's the number of civilians they kill.   Which is partly due to the technology, there's no good way to aim them, and partly due to deliberately targeting civilians.</p>
<p>But the reason you hear the phrase &quot;barrel bomb&quot; so much in Western media is at least partly propaganda.  It suggests that the Syrian government is so desperate and isolated that the only bombs they've got are jury-rigged barrels, and yet they're still managing to slaughter people.  The implication is that if we got more seriously involved we could settle this thing before lunchtime.</p>
<p>I am not going to comment on the wisdom of serious military action in Syria, my point is just that the phrase &quot;barrel bomb&quot; comes with an agenda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read about them, there are two reasons they are bad. A barrel bomb is an improvised explosive device usually filled with gasoline and almost any hard object for shrapnel like nails, ball bearing and broken glass to even just rocks. This is one of the reasons it's so bad, when it blows up it can kill or just seriously injure people but most bombs do that. The second and biggest reason is they are improvised bombs there is no set type of bomb it may use gasoline or explosives or anything that should explode when dropped but there is no guarantee it will explode when or where it's dropped it could roll a long way and blow up next to kids or anywhere really </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
