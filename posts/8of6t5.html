		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that the lymphatic system doesn't circulate by itself, but instead relies on the body moving around to push it's contents. That's the reason why you're not drowning in snot in your sleep, but also why you experience all that buildup as soon as you get up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is histamine release when you wake up. I can’t be specific; I’m no expert; but I am treated for morning nausea and morning sneezing/allergies - they get very severe when I wake up.. for almost 10 years. Anyway, one doc explained that there’s a cascade of chemical and hormones in the “wake up” process and sometimes your body can, as a byproduct, release a lot of histamine in the morning </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hayfever, it allergies, can affect you while you sleep. Mine got to the point where I had one side of my sinuses that would completely clog at night. The pressure build up would get to the point that I would wake with the pain and have to roll over to relieve the pressure. I'd also frequently be woken with a period of.sneezing that could last up to 12 sneezes or so. If your Hayfever doesn't bother you at night maybe it just isn't severe enough. For clarity, I'm allergic to more than just pollen. I know this isn't an explanation so it will probably get deleted,  but just letting you know the thought behind your original question is not completely correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A whole heap of reasons. People already mentioned your body itself shuts down the reaction to sleep, but also plants aren't putting as much energy into producing pollen at night, winds are generally calmer so it stays on the plant more, being inside rather than outside will filter some out, morning dew brings more down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
