<p>But that stupid front window. It's an eternity, half the time I end up with frost <em>inside</em> as well from daring to breathe once inside.  More often than not, I end up with a nicely cleared rear window, shivering waiting for the front.</p>
<p>Why can't that front windshield have the defroster wires?</p>
<p>(Can visibility be that much of an issue? It is the only reason I can come up with.)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ford had this back to 1987 on some Lincolns with cold weather packages.  The windshield had a thin transparent sheet of gold sandwiched between the layers.  Upon activation the alternator was full fielded and 140 amps of electricity was delivered to heat the windshield.  Really effective when it worked, an incredibly expensive clusterfuck when it burned up the alternator, and harness when it didn't work.  Need a new windshield...$3K please, and that was if they were available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automotive HVAC engineer here! My job literally is responsible for windshield clearing. </p>
<p>As other people have pointed out, there are some cars that use the heated wiring up front. I sat in a Range Rover that had it. They were very, very fine zigzag wires across the windshield that could only be seen when focusing your eyes on it. When driving, it wasn't noticable in the slightest.</p>
<p>Something that new cars have now is what's called a PTC. This is essentially an electric heater that provides warm air before the engine has had time to warm up the coolant running through the heater core. The air that comes out of it isn't hot, but it's still warm and instantly available on a cold day. Also, most cars offer remote start, which does wonders for clearing the glass in the morning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
