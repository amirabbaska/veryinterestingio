<p>Gravity on Mars is about 38% of earth. So a 170 pound man would only weight about 64 pounds. </p>
<p>You'd also be able to jump higher. Roughly 2.6 times higher, in fact! So for every foot, you'd jump 2.6 feet!</p>
<p>Also, I believe you meant to say a linear relationship. Gravity has a direct relationship with jump height, whether it's linear or not. Linear describes the type of relationship (one to one increase). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General Formula for max height of a ballistic trajectory:</p>
<pre><code>max_height = V^2 * sin(θ)^2
            ----------------
                   2g

V = initial velocity
θ = launch angle
g = acceleration due to gravity</code></pre>
<p>Earth:</p>
<pre><code>V = 3 m/s
θ = 90°
g = 9.8 m/s^2

(3^2 * sin(90°)^2) / (2* 9.8) = 0.46 meters</code></pre>
<p>Mars:</p>
<pre><code>V = 3 m/s
θ = 90°
g = 3.7 m/s^2

(3^2 * sin(90°)^2) / (2* 3.7) = 1.22 meters</code></pre>
<p>.</p>
<pre><code>Earth g : Mars g ratio = 9.8 / 3.7 =  2.65

Earth jump height : Mars jump height ratio = 0.46 / 1.22 = 0.38 = 1 / 2.65</code></pre>
<p>If your acceleration due to gravity decreases by a factor, your jump height will increase by that factor.</p>
<p>Note that these calculations ignore the effects of distance from center-of-mass changing the acceleration due to gravity as they're irrelevant when comparing human jumping heights with the size of planets.  I.E. Plugging large initial velocities in will give bad answers as they launch the projectile into area with significantly lower g.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should be able to jump higher than the gravity ratio of 9.8/3.7=2.65
The simplest approximation is to assume that initial velocity of the jump is the same. As as been shown, this would lead to a Mars jump height of 2.65x the earth height. </p>
<p>If we assume instead that the amount of work applied  is the same for both cases and that the mechanics of jumping (CG travel from crouch to full extension) are the same, then there is additional potential energy associated with the acceleration phase before liftoff.  </p>
<p>Variables
he - earth jump height
hm - mars jump height
Ve- initial velocity earth
Vm- initial velocity mars
ge- accel due to gravity earth
gm- accel due to gravity mars
di- CG distance from crouch to liftoff </p>
<p>Given
he = (Ve^2)/(2 ge)
Then
Ve = sqrt(2 ge he)</p>
<p>State: Crouch
Energy = 0</p>
<p>State: liftoff earth
Work = 1/2 <em> m </em> Ve^2 + m <em> ge </em> di</p>
<p>State apex earth
Work = m <em> ge </em> he + m <em> ge </em> di</p>
<p>State apex mars
Work  = m <em> gm </em> hm + m <em> gm </em> di</p>
<p>Assuming work applied by body is the same on mars </p>
<p>m <em> gm </em> hm + m <em> gm </em> di = m <em> ge </em> he + m <em> ge </em> di</p>
<p>Simplifying m and solving for hm</p>
<p>gm <em> hm + gm </em> di = ge <em> he + ge </em> di</p>
<p>gm <em> hm = ge </em> he + ge <em> di - gm </em> di </p>
<p>hm = ge/gm <em> he + (ge/gm -1)</em>di </p>
<p>As can be seen in the final equation, there is an additional factor based on the distance of the applied work. </p>
<p>For di = 1 ft and he = 2 ft the resulting hm is 6.95 ft or 3.48*he</p>
<p>This is a significant increase from the constant initial velocity assumption. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this has been mentioned, but you might overestimate how high you can jump here on earth. Other posts explain how much higher you are able to jump, but keep in mind that these calculations concern you center of gravity. This means that if you pull you legs up, that doesn't count. </p>
<p>If you want to know how far you can get you center of mass up by jumping, just jump without pulling your legs in. For a non athletic person like myself, it's not a whole lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not a linear relationship.  In 1/2.6th the gravity, you'll be able to jump more than 2.6x the height.  Just reverse the situation to see intuitively why that is.  If it was a linear relationship, then in 2x the gravity you'd jump 1/2 as high, 4x the gravity you'd jump 1/4 as high, and at 100x the gravity you'd jump 1/100 as high.  Of course that's not possible though.  In 100x the gravity you wouldn't even be able to exert enough force to stand, let alone jump.</p>
<p>As you start to increase gravity, you'll find that pretty quickly you reach the point where it takes all of your force just to stand, at that point you can't jump at all, and any more than that you collapse.</p>
<p>Your legs can only exert so much force.  A significant fraction of that force is used just to cancel out your body weight from gravity.  Only the remaining force can be used to accelerate your body mass and make you jump.  In a lower gravity environment, you have more force left over to put into jumping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
