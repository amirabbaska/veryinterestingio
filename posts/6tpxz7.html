		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if I'm wrong but I suspect you are asking this because of a simplified understanding of our circulatory system, thinking that arteries carry blood all the way to the end of our limbs, then the blood is carried all the way back to our heart by veins, and severing this flow means arteries are no longer connected to veins.</p>
<p>In reality there are smaller vessels branching off of the main artery constantly which go through your muscles and organs then reconnect to veins at the end. The arteries get progressively smaller as they reach the end of your limbs because of all the branches so they are carrying less blood. Similarly, veins grow larger as they get closer to your heart because of branches entering them and the veins carry more blood.</p>
<p>When you lose a limb the artery is suddenly ended and the blood simply goes through the other branches. There is higher blood pressure in that area for a little while as the artery is now too large for the amount of body it needs to feed but over time the system equalizes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really need to. Any cells that are still part of the body also still have blood vessels delivering blood to them. The only part of the circulatory system that was lost was the part that was delivering blood to the tissue that was also lost. Imagine if half of Manhattan disappeared. There'd be no issue getting around the part that was still there. The roads that are gone were only useful to get to the buildings that are also gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Surgeon will seal off the ends of the damaged vessels so bleeding will stop. However almost every part of your body had a &quot;backup&quot; system of perfusion called an 'anastomoses'. This is basicly where vessels from different suppliers meet causing reciprocal blood flood. So while the cells are sending out chemical messages saying &quot;hey we need more blood flow here&quot; (start of angiogenesis aka. new blood vessle formulations) the reciprocal blood flow supplies less than optimal but still enough blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you lose your limb suddenly and don't stop the bleeding, you die. </p>
<p>If you stop the bleeding but lost a significant amount of blood (this is the typical traumatic scenario), in the first minutes-hours, the circulatory system will respond to the blood deficit. The main mechanisms are constricting blood flow to nonvital tissue (the other 3 extremities) and pumping the heart faster; this is the classic picture of shock. The comparisons to manmade systems with circuits misses the enormous capacity of the circulatory system to change vessel diameter / resistance on a second-to-second basis. Long term, the rest of the body will return to its original equilibrium; you would expect a commensurate decrease in blood volume because there is less body mass (adults have more blood volume than children, it's often calculated based on body mass).</p>
<p>If you surgically removed the limb with no bleeding, you can skip the blood deficit / vasoconstriction / tachycardia portion. All the dead ends of the blood vessels will more or less slow to no flow. In the first weeks to months, there can be some pooling, mainly if gravity is pulling fluid down without an opposing muscular force to push it back up. Depending on the permeability of a given individual's blood vessels at a given moment in time, some people would have more pooling, some would have less.</p>
<p>Re: collateralization and &quot;anastomoses&quot;, these are relevant when an isolated section of the limb's circulatory network is disrupted. Cut the radial artery, the ulnar artery will continue to supply the hand. However, if you transect the entire limb perpendicular to the flow of blood, the remaining tissue has all of its circulatory network preserved and collateralization is not really relevant. The &quot;veiny&quot; hand is an example of collateralization - cut one of the veins, the others will still execute the main purpose of the hand's veins, which is to return its blood back to the heart. To correct the &quot;veiny&quot; author, veins don't supply blood, they drain blood. Notably in the hand, the veins are mainly on the back side, the arteries mainly on the palm side. The muscles in the forearm are fed by bigger arteries and drained by bigger veins, consistent with their increased muscle/tissue density; those vessels are however mostly deep to the skin so not visible. The hand is highly collateralized in general because it is an important body part (the amount of brain committed to the hand is much more than its percent surface area).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming controlled loss of limb (e.g. amputation).</p>
<p>Once the tourniquet is applied, there is a rise in systemic vascular resistance which leads to increased blood pressure assuming constant cardiac output (pressure=flow x resistance) and non failing heart. This is due to the loss of a parallel 'circuit'.</p>
<p>After some time, the cardiac output will then change in a predictable way (see vascular function curve or Guyton curve if you are interested) depending on blood loss and replacement of fluids, but eventually the arteriolar resistances of all the other vascular beds will adjust (locally mediated and also via the autonomic nervous system) to maintain their own perfusion and another equilibrium point will be reached.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
