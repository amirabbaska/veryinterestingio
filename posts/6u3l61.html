		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human mind is capable of continuing tasks, even complex ones such as driving, while focusing on something else. As you become better and better at reading, your mind can continue to scan a page and identify the words while never actually processing them. It's the same reason people can drive for miles and not remember driving very far at all. The action of reading is no different, your mind recognizes words just like your mind recognizes speed limits or curves in the road. Your pace of reading is automatic and identifying the words is easier than actually remember them. Reading is an easy task after you've practiced for so many years and it can become as boring as driving a highway. That's why you can read through a page of text and be thinking of something else the entire time, you don't process or remember it, you just went into &quot;auto-pilot&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Like looking at something through a camera without actually taking a picture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Kahneman (psychologist, author of Thinking fast and slow) explains this through two concepts called system 1 and system 2. System 1 is your intuition, the things you do on autopilot, &quot;automatically&quot;. Like bicycling. System 2 is your analytical, conscious and reflective thinking. Things that needs your attention essentially, like a math problem.</p>
<p>Now, system 2 is lazy. So anything that you repeat or practice enough will sooner or later be handed over to your system 1, to be processed on &quot;autopilot&quot;.</p>
<p>I remember an experiment from the book in which one group was handed a text printed black on white paper, and another group the same text but where the text was grey on white paper (which was slightly harder to read). After having read the text, the two groups were asked questions about the text. The group with black text on white remembered significantly less of the contents they read than the group who had slightly less contrast in their print.</p>
<p>They explained this using system 1 and system 2. The group who had a high contrast printout didn't have to concentrate on reading the text, thus leaving it up to system 1 to read and process its contents without any reflective thinking involved while the second group were forced to use system 2 in order to just be able to read the text.</p>
<p>I can highly recommend that book. Creates a whole new understanding of how your brain works.</p>
