		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WARNING LONG! But, it's my field of work (computational biology), so I'll give you the detailed answer.</p>
<p>This is like my exact field of study, so I can comment on this.  You hear &quot;epigenetics&quot; and this is kind of the surface answer to explain <em>heritable</em> information from cell to cell that causes varied gene expression, even though one cell from the other has the exact same DNA. However, there is more to it than that. There is also something called &quot;stochastic noise&quot; that can actually affect development too, of which I will get to later. I also think it is prudent to point out that there may also be other unknown factors yet to be identified. </p>
<p>So, let me give you a broader explanation that hopefully makes sense. Your DNA is identical in every single cell of your body, whether it is the DNA in your lungs, or your skin, your heart cells, your liver cells and so on (typically, some exceptions). What makes each cell different? What makes each cell different is something called &quot;gene expression,&quot; or, more simply, what makes each cell different is the spectrum of proteins that are produced in each different cell.</p>
<p>How does that work though? How does one cell that has the same DNA as another cell &quot;know&quot; what proteins to produce? The answer is a word we use quite often, and that is, by &quot;regulation.&quot; You see, at the end of the day, cells don't &quot;know&quot; anything. They don't think. They are just proteins and various molecules floating around and bumping into each other. And, if they happen to bump into each other, sometimes interesting things can happen. You see, it is all just about the &quot;probability&quot; of bumping into each other though. This is what we call cellular &quot;noise.&quot;</p>
<p>Think of it like this. If there is a large concentration of a certain protein, there is a much higher probability that it will bump into something which can cause a reaction, which can cause some kind of event downstream. If there is a low concentration, sometimes there may be just a random chance of things bumping into each other, but it will be more rare. This is a form of cellular regulation.</p>
<p>So, this brings me back to the question, well why does one cell with the same DNA produce different proteins than the another cell? Simple, it has to do with the way DNA is packaged up. Unlike the common picture of the double helix you often see in TV, DNA in reality is covered in proteins. I won't go into the amazing amount of variability and functions of it all, so simply, in one cell, the DNA gets packaged up differently than others. For example, in one cell, the DNA will be &quot;wound up&quot; extremely tight in certain areas, whilst open in others. Where it is wound up tight, proteins are unable to bind to the DNA to activate the process(transcription) of which proteins are derived from the DNA (Transcription &gt; Translation). You can kind of say that certain genes are hidden from collisions with other proteins in these tightly wound regions. Where it is loose, they will bind. Ultimately, this is the core way one cell differs from the other, the way the DNA is packaged up. A liver cell will only have its cocktail of proteins able to be translated, whilst the others packed up, and other cells might have a very different regime of proteins to produce.</p>
<p>I should note that this is still poorly understood. We know a lot more now than we did 10 years ago, but a lot of thesis work is going on in this department cause it is incredibly complex. But that is just a side note, so I wouldn't worry about it here.</p>
<p>Now that you have this big picture (albeit simplified), we go back to your question, how do identical twins look different even though they have the same DNA? Well, one answer is that we have a field called epigenetics. What this is is that through environmental factors, modifications happen to the proteins that package the DNA (methylations), and for one person, through their own life choices, experiences, and environmental factors, the DNA may get packaged slightly different. These will not be extreme differences, as most cellular function must remain the same, but lets use an extreme example: The twins are separated at birth, and one goes to a very poor home and another to a well-fed home. Let's say several times in this child's life he was malnourished, or just didn't eat as healthy or something. Maybe that body went into a more &quot;survival&quot; mode and he just grew less tall, or more puny than his twin that was well-fed.  The DNA modified its packaging to stop transcription of certain proteins or activate others that another person may not have, like their twin.  Sometimes it might be as simple as lowering the expression of a protein by half in one person compared to the other. These modifications that happen due to environmental factors will carry on in each replication. Hence, it's not in the DNA code itself, but there is stored information that copies how the DNA is packaged as well, thus it's not true genetics, it is epigenetics. So, the twins end up looking different because some of these proteins affect the phenotype, or the outward, visible expression of a protein. For example, brown hair verse red hair are phenotypes. Short vs tall, etc. Some genes are related to various phenotypes, and these just may end up being expressed different from one twin to the next due to epigenetic modifications of their DNA.</p>
<p>Also, DNA methylations are heritable. If you want to read up on the exact term, we call it &quot;genomic imprinting.&quot; There was another post here that already covered it nicely, but let's say in very early cell-differentiation you had half the methylated DNA on one side, half on the other, if the cell splits to form twins, one of the twins will receive some portion of the heritable methylations from the mother and the other twin will get the rest. This will lead to some different gene expression between the two of you as well.</p>
<p>There is another issue though. What if I told you that in a theoretical world, if both twins had 100% exactly the same environmental factors to face them through their whole life, that they still will most-likely not be perfect matches of each other? WHAT!? How is that possible? Remember I talked about how in the cell things are just floating around and bumping into each other? Well, this noise is &quot;stochastic,&quot; meaning random. In early cellular development, even if 2 cells side-by-side have the same cocktail of proteins and is the same scale, there is still only the &quot;probability&quot; of things bumping into each other enough to hit certain thresholds for certain signaling pathways to be activated. Early stochastic noise in the cell can actually cause fairly significant downstream differences. Maybe some early signaling for a growth factor ended up being 25% stronger just through &quot;stochastic&quot; noise. Now, through probability, most things will be the same, but also through probability, there is going to be some differences no matter what. This is also why if you took an animal and cloned it, the DNA may be the same, but it becomes nothing more than a &quot;twin&quot; who is not a perfect match due to the stochastic changes that occurred in early cellular development.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is a bit more to it than that, but I thought I'd hopefully explain a bigger, more understandable picture to anyone that stumbled upon this, also because I am procrastinating my own work right now and thought, why not, I'll give a big answer. Hope it helped.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Wow, this has gotten a lot more traction that I had even imagined! I probably would have given some finer details if I knew it would explode like this, as now I am re-reading it and thinking to myself, &quot;Oh great, now where did I go wrong and am about to be corrected?&quot; Thanks everyone. It's an extremely fascinating world we live in, and imo, there is nothing more fascinating than the incredible workings of the cell. Keep learning!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics is the short answer:
Both twins have the gene for brown eyes, but due to the epigenetics, one twin can highly regulate the brown gene, resulting in light brown eyes, while the other twin can barely regulate it resulting in dark brown eyes.</p>
<p>When the egg initially divides all dna has histones with different methylation states that affects how 'on' or 'off' certain genes are.  In a cell that will become a liver cell, the methylation pattern tells that cell 'you are a liver, make these proteins'.  If the egg splits into  two embryos (twins), then there is a chance that 1 twin will have 1 set of histones methylation patterns, and the other will have a different.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics is an important aspect of developmental diversification, but it is not a complete answer.  No one has yet mentioned anything about stochasticity in development, which is a gross oversight.  The ELI5 of it all, is that cells are small things and they operate with small quantities of even smaller things.  On those scales, reaction kinetics and cellular behaviors can be very stochastic, or random.  So even if you could magically duplicate a cell PERFECTLY... epigenetic marks and all... it would not do exactly the same thing as its perfect clone on the same time-scale.  Placed in the context of development, multiply those tiny stochastic, random fluctuations by millions, billions and even trillions of cellular decisions, reactions, and interactions, and the result is a different organism.  Regulation of our gene expression and of our epigenetic patterning serves to corral the random, stochastic nature of chemistry at those small scales... but is not perfect in doing so.</p>
<p>An imperfect, but reasonable theoretical example... genetics dictate that everyone has a brachial artery.  Genes and epigenetics dictate the path it takes down your arm and influences how it branches into your hand.  Developmental stochasticity (randomness) makes it so that the precise branch pattern of all the tiny, peripheral vessels are different for every person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other answers, environmental factors can affect appearance over the course of the Twins' life. Differences in diet, exercise, activity level, and trauma (for example, injuries) can all affect a person's appearance. For example, if the twins have very different diets, or if one is athletic, this can affect growth and development during childhood and puberty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
