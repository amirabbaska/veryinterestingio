		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most small boats are designed to glide over and even out if the water at high speed in a process called &quot;planing,&quot; which can't happen if the propeller is in front. Airplanes can be designed with &quot;tractor&quot; or &quot;pusher&quot; configurations of propellers. Pusher propeller designs have many disadvantages,  like having to use an airflow disturbed by the fuselage, having to avoid hitting the ground when the pitching up during takeoff, center of gravity issues, vibration, ingesting ice from wings, heat dissipation...there's a long list of problems that are solved by using the tractor design. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pusher had the advantage that guns were free to fire directly forward, but were disliked by pilots because a small crash would send the engine/spinning propeller thru the pilot.</p>
<p>With the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_gear" target="_blank">Synchronization gear</a> tractor aircraft were able to fire forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Propellers cause leakage of air or water into the craft. If the propeller was at the front of a boat, more water would be pushed into the hull, whereas with rear facing propellers water flows past. Additionally, propellers in the front could hit other crafts, docks, or land if the boat runs aground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a interesting question. I have always wondered why some boats lean into a turn (e.g. speedboats) but larger vessels lean outward (e.g.  a destroyer). I presume it's to do with centrifugal force, centre of gravity, centre of effort, keep depth). Any ideas</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TL;DR for airplanes is that generally an aircraft with a propeller and engine in the front will be a more stable and safe aircraft. (with the added bonus of being able to push air into an engine intake for better performance.) There are however, exceptions, with the Dornier 335 being a combination push/pull system, and the P-39 / P-63, who's engine was located behind the pilot to make room for a 37mm automatic cannon. The XP-55 ascender (featured in war thunder) was a straight pusher aircraft, though IIRC it killed both test pilots on the two occasions that it flew. </p>
<p>TLDR: It's safer / more efficient in design, etc for the propeller to be in the front. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
