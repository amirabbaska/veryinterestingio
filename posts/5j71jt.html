		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplified: (It's how I understand it best)</p>
<p>For ease of understanding let's just say you're looking at the glass at 90^^O to it's plane. And you're both upright.</p>
<p>You can see all the light coming through the glass when it's PERFECTLY clean.</p>
<p>Now. Let's say you wipe the glass in only one dimension. Up-down. And only on the inside (more on this later).</p>
<p>Now you see the light coming through the glass PLUS light bent through any pollution on the glass. (Streaks).</p>
<p>&quot;But what had this to do with polarisation?&quot;</p>
<p>Polarisation is the posh word for the angle of the light. Some  is up down, some left to right, some diagonal sets.</p>
<p>If you go up-down you'd see a few streaks BUT only those guided through the pollution in the window and ONLY those that guided the light to your eyes.</p>
<p>Now. Light Is a funny old thing. It is both a particle AND a wave. If light was ONLY a particle we'd be stuck here. But because it's a wave we have an answer to the streak thing. (It's also why lasers &quot;cut&quot; things even though they have no mass.) </p>
<p>Imagine the glass, not as solid but as bars of glass all mixed up. Up, down etc. Light &quot;waves&quot; come through the glass AND then streaks towards you.</p>
<p>Now that the science bit is done, into the reasoning;</p>
<p>Go up- down and you create HUNDREDS of streaks BUT you only see the one or two aiming light DIRECTLY at you. If you angle your head and change your position you see LOTS more over time. It's why motherfuckers come in and say &quot;you miss a bit&quot;. Of course you missed Bit. You missed fucking LOADS but you weren't in the newcomers position so you &quot;missed&quot; them.</p>
<p>Now. Go in circles and you will ALWAYS find streaks. So will everyone else.</p>
<p>So, why up down inside and side to side outside? partly because you know which side of the glass a streak uson and oddlry dor that, if you are REALLY unlucky to get Streak inside and one outside positioned directly over each other, you can see them. </p>
<p>Imagine cleaning a streak you find, only for it NOT to go away. You clean it and stand backback. It's STILL there. Clean again. Still there. What you DON'T know Is that it's an optical illusion created be a streak outside.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: polarised glasses. They have navy uses. Including [sung what others can't] (<a href="https://youtu.be/MNbg4Go8NR0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/MNbg4Go8NR0</a>). Like under water with reflected light. (see above waffle about light angles)</p>
<p>Fun fact: glass is NOT transparent. It's blue-green. Look at it side on through a plane. &quot;More proof!&quot; I hear you cry. Ok. You can hide your thermal signature (A type of light wave) be standing behind glass (or other solid object). If you're checked by police helicopters, go stand in a gym. The FLIR Canberra can't see you and you have a reason Rio assist sweaty to the <del>military</del> police.</p>
<p>&quot;more proof!&quot; Ok. Do you have a drinking glass, set of spectacles, or other small glass object? Hold it up to sunlight and look at it's shadow... I'll give you a moment here. Its &quot;shadow&quot;. A transparent, see-through object is casting a shadow. It's because if that pesky polarisation I mentioned.</p>
<p>(P.s. I advise looking into this. YouTube is your friend. I say this because I have certain mental health issues. I can understand something and work with it, FULLY understanding and fully knowing it's properties, but I can't explain it. My best analogy is magnets. You know they havemagnetic fields right. and you know their properties but... Magnets, obese tell me now; how the Fuck do they &quot;work&quot;)</p>
<p>I hope this explains things better and I know this is like saying &quot;just because&quot; to a kid who just asked &quot;hire do bumblebees fly?&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>
<p>P.s. Seriously, YouTube and Google are fantastic sources of knowledge. Just... Fact check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These comments are close, but not quite right. Cloth is fibrous. There are microscopic valleys and ridges that allow some of the cleaner to be left behind with each stroke. Circular wiping minimizes what gets left behind because the ridges on the cloth are constantly overlapping the fluid left behind by the other fibers, and you are able to remove far more than single-directional wiping.</p>
<p>For the record, you should also sand in this manner. You will get a smoother, more even finish in much less time.</p>
<p>Edit: got it, not with wood. My answer was based on my more extensive experience as an autobody tech than my limited experience as a woodworker. Thank you all for being gentle with your corrections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the other comments are correct, someone mentioned sanding.  Be careful when sanding wood or washing your car with circular motions, because any scratching that's done (sanding wood or if you get any grit in your sponge/cloth when washing), will also be in a circular shape.</p>
<p>Circular scratches are visible from any angle, whereas if you sand wood or wash the car with straight motions, a scratch will usually only be visible from a perpendicular angle to the scratch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, when wiping in a circular motion you &quot;wipe&quot; the area of the mirror multiple times as you clean. With wiping straight, you make one pass and the leftover water or glass cleaner is what creates the streaks. By using a circular pattern you wipe the mirror multiple times, thus picking up any leftover water or cleaner, meaning less streaks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
