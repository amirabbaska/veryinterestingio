<p>Dark energy doesn't have or experience forces.  Dark energy isn't a physical thing, it is a property of spacetime or possibly of a field defined on spacetime -- it is not an object that can experience forces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could it be that there is some unknown 5th fundamental force for dark energy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are proposals that model dark energy as something like a 5th fundamental force (a new fundamental bosonic quantum field), but there are problems with many of these proposals and to date they offer no value over standard general relativity with a small cosmological constant.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dark energy is a placeholder name for a phenomenon which is not well understood.</p>
<p>Most simply, the universe behaves as though all of empty space wasn't quite empty, but rather filled with a very rarefied something, with a uniform density on the scale of 10^(-30) g/cm^3. Such conditions, under general relativity, would cause space to expand, and it's from observations of this expansion that we came up with the density. </p>
<p>This something is called dark energy, but other than its apparent density, it has only one other property: it doesn't get diluted as the universe expands. You'd think that more space + same energy = lower density, but dark energy only works if the new space is immediately filled with more dark energy, at the same density. There's no real explanation for what sort of thing does that.</p>
<p>So, in terms of our observations, the only by gravity does dark energy interact with the rest of the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dark Energy is known to interact only through gravity, which is how we learned of its existence and the mechanics of universe expansion. It does not interact through any other known forces and a lack of better explanation might be related to our incomplete understanding of gravity. Both theoretically and practically, it is possible for previously unidentified forces to be in effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
