While I know that advertising and sponsorships can provide lots of money, giving away anywhere from 0-50k per night (on average) seems like an extremely high amount from just advertising and sponsoring. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game shows are actually among the cheapest shows to make.  No actors, no writers, no special effects, just a single set that never changes, some D-list celebrity to host and a wannabe starlet to gesture at things.  They don't even have rehearsals, everything is in one take and bang out a week's worth of episodes in an afternoon.  Plus the prizes are often provided to them at low or no cost because they serve as advertising for the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Compare this to scripted shows like <em>NCIS</em> or <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, where the actors alone cost millions per episode.  $50K in cash and prizes doesn't seem like so much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing is that gameshows are MUCH cheaper to produce than a scripted series. You don't have to pay for actors, script writers, costumes, new sets, props, location shooting. Once you build the gameshow set, you're good to go. As such, the millions of dollars that would have gone towards all the expenses of filming a scripted series can go into prize money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For budget comparison, your average scripted TV show costs between 3-5 million per episode. Giving a contestant $50k in cash is peanuts when talking television production. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick google says a national 30 second TV commercial goes for $100k+, and I believe a 1 hour show is usually 45min or less? So a 30 min show probably has 15 commercials, assuming they only take in half of the income (I assume someone is taking a big cut, I have no idea what that is), then you're talking $750k/show. A quick google says Pat Sajak makes $15mil, so if they only work 40 weeks a year, that's $75k/show which seems reasonable to me. Still leaves you $625k/show to pay for everything else, and if you assume the average person costs $300k (including overhead), then a staff of 30 people is only $45k/show.</p>
<p>Also, important to remember Judge Judy makes $47mil/yr, that's daytime TV, that show has some staff and a set, and 52 weeks of 5 shows a week still equates to $180k/show for just her income, so yes, those shows have no problem bringing at least $200k/show, and my numbers above, with $50k given away still comes under Judge Judys salary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
