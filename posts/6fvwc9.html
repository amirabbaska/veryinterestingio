		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have already covered the common answers of &quot;That was the ideal penis because of modesty, associations with barbarianism&quot; and &quot;Well, honestly, that's what most cocks look like flaccid and standing in a cold room modeling for someone&quot; both of these have some truth to them, but don't think that the cultures were afraid gigantic cocks and portraying them, because that's absolutely not the case. The &quot;modest&quot; argument tends to a late addition, and it comes from a period which ignores a lot of the sexuality that the Greeks and Romans showed in order to portray something more moral. The &quot;well shit, it's cold&quot; is a bit more on the point. That's not to say modesty isn't involved at all, because it is an important fact, and things like the kynodesme relay this, but: </p>
<p>but what I haven't seen mentioned, at least in the top comments, is that large cock statues DID exist in both Greece and Rome, but for different purposes. The Hermae of Greece had absolutely gigantic cocks, the ones in Athens were cut off on either an act of vandialism, or an act against democracy right before the Sicilian Expedition (there's a lot of debate on this, and as much as I'd like to say it's the latter, there's no definite proof and even the people admitting fault were pressured to do so to save their lives.) </p>
<p>But we do have representations of them in pottery, here's one showing a gigantic cock of a herm (the statue on the right) and the gigantic cock of pan <a href="http://www.cvaonline.org/images/pottery/painters/keypieces/tiverios/23-p161bottom-medium.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.cvaonline.org/images/pottery/painters/keypieces/tiverios/23-p161bottom-medium.jpg</a></p>
<p>and another likely showing hermae (though they would not have shown this much of the lower body...err the lower body below the cock) <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/02/72/15/0272153fef1db8ab142cb016b4879e02.jpg" target="_blank">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/02/72/15/0272153fef1db8ab142cb016b4879e02.jpg</a></p>
<p>Then we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascinus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascinus</a> of Rome, essentially signs of luck and fortune and fertility. which gives us things like this lovely monstrosity <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Bas-relief_of_fascinus.jpg/1280px-Bas-relief_of_fascinus.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Bas-relief_of_fascinus.jpg/1280px-Bas-relief_of_fascinus.jpg</a> </p>
<p>And of course, everyone's favourite god: Priapus: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg/800px-Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg/800px-Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg</a></p>
<p>These things survive better in frescoes and descriptions because things sticking out a long distance tend to break off easily of statues (this is why a lot of statues also lack arms... same thing going on with erect penises... lack of support, and more likely for something to accidentally rest upon it and break it off -- and while the amount has been exaggerated, there have been crusader types that have purposefully censored works like this.) </p>
<p>But I'm rambling now, so I'll stop. But basically: big cocks did exist, just many didn't survive in the sculptures we have today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a tradition in ancient times that a small penis was associated with heroism, wisdom, and moderation - basically, the ideal man wasn't distracted by lustful urges, so his genitals were understated.  </p>
<p>If you look at Greek and Roman art depicting satyrs, barbarians, pervy old men, they've got big floppy ol' wing-dings, because they were ruled by those lesser urges.  But the heroes were focused on other stuff, though I'm sure they got around plenty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Much of the Roman style was copied from the greeks, so although they appreciated a fine dick joke in other forums, the artistic style on their sculptures didn't reflect that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other than heroism, wisdom, etc like the others have stated. People have theorized that the small genitalia referenced the ancient Greek ideal for per-pubescent male nudity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_\(Michelangelo\)#Interpretation" target="_blank"><strong>{Source; Wikipedia}</strong></a></p>

<p>As said in the top article, &quot;one of the most common and socially acceptable relationships was between a man and a young boy&quot; in ancient Greece. So one of the most ideal forms of beauty at that time was looking like a 12 year old boy so you could attract wealthy old men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;pleasing women was about the last priority that any self-respecting Greek hero would have had back then&quot;</p>
