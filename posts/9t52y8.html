		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comments explain what a bit is, but not why it is base 2, and not some other arbitrary number. In transistors, the power is either on or off. 1 or 0. In order to have a 3 bit or greater computing system, you would need to measure <em>how much</em> electrical charge the transistor holds, as opposed to whether or not it has a charge. While that in and of itself wouldn’t be too difficult, as transistors degrade overtime, those partial electrical charges (that you’d need to accurately measure to determine what value it holds), would become inaccurate. It’s much easier to read on/off, than try and read partial electrical charges. </p>
<p>EDIT: as several comments have pointed out, it is not simply on or off, but low charge and high charge. Think of a full cup of water. It might not be 100% full to the brim, but you can still call it full. This is on.</p>
<p>Now dump out the water. There are still some drops and dribbles of water, however you can say for all intents and purposes that the cup is empty (off). Yes, there’s still some “charge” in there, but for our purposes, we can call that empty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine you're filing out a paper form.  You write 6 in one of the boxes but it gets mistaken for 8.  The 'check all that apply' boxes don't have this problem because you could mark them in any way (X, ✔, etc.) since you're only checking if there's something in the checkbox or not.  As the paper gets worn out, your writing gets illegible but it's still easy to tell whether a checkbox is marked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, a bit is specifically a Binary Integer. By definition a bit has only two possible states. If we did not use binary integers to represent information in our computers, then we likely would not refer to information in terms of bits so often. There were many experiments for using different schemes to store information, like bi-quinary and balanced ternary, for example.</p>
<p>If you want to know why we settled on bits, well, that's a long and convoluted story, and I'd be surprised if anyone knew most of the details. The two most important parts of it, however, involve two men: George Boole and Claude Shannon.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>George Boole's work on Boolean Algebra gave us a robust way to simplify complicated ideas into webs of yes/no questions. Answer the initial questions with whatever yes/no data you have, follow the results to each subsequent question, and at the end you'll have some answer.</p>
</li>
<li>Claude Shannon realized that evaluating Boolean expressions could be automated with relay switches, the electro-mechanical devices telecoms used to make sure signals got where they needed to go. Shannon's insight paved the way for the development of modern computing hardware by showing us that Boolean Algebra was a good and flexible model for automated computing.</li>
</ol>
<p>And as time passed bits won out over more exotic representations of information because Boolean Algebra was a more mature field. More work had been done on it, and more people knew how to reason about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
