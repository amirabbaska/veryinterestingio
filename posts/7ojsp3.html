<p>One benefit of this oil is that it makes the feathers waterproof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned the oil mechanism, which is an excellent point. After an osprey takes off from water and shakes water out from the air, they look virtually dry. </p>
<p>In addition, ospreys, which eat fish pretty much exclusively, have extra long powerful wings in comparison to other raptors. I assume that's a factor in their ability to fly straight of water they were immersed in, often clasping a heavy fish. They're remarkable animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although many people have commented on the water-repellent qualities of bird feathers (most water birds), and the strength of their wings (ospreys, kingfishers), there is another method that the largest diving birds use to get airborne again. They have to free themselves from the surface tension of the water by running on the surface until they are moving fast enough to become airborne.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the oilyness the other dudes talked about.<br />
The feathers also acts as insulation keeping air inside - so they dont lose body heat when in cold water.<br />
And birds are generaly vary light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
