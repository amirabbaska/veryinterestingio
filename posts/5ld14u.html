<p>It got 200mbps on LTE.</p>
<p>America hasn't caught up and hasn't improved a bit.</p>
<p>I'm on the fastest and best network in America (Verizon) and I only get 40mbps tops on LTE.</p>
<p>Why are other countries so much faster then America in terms of internet speed?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Verizon has the best coverage, but it's not the fastest, I'm visiting family in Atlanta and I get &gt;110Mbps on T-Mobile. Though, I'm on their Wi-Fi as <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/i/1916489877" target="_blank">it's much faster</a> (he's an exec at HP so gotta have fast Internet).  </p>
<p>90% of the answer is because they can.  </p>
<p>10% of the answer is because money, America is huge, and dense, so having to have thousands/millions of cell towers spread across the country and having hundreds in a single city is expensive in regards to renting out the land, supplying enough data per tower, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mainly has to do with the monopoly that ISP's hold over different areas. Most people have one choice for their internet provider. It's not like you can switch to a different company if you aren't happy with their shit service. </p>
<p>Another thing is that the capacity for fast internet exists it's just that they have no reason to give it to you. </p>
<p>My city recently became a prospective city for google fiber and TWC immediately upgraded our 20mb/s connection (maximum available) to 100mb/s for free and also started offering 200mb/s and 300mb/s for not much extra. They're also doing everything they can lawsuit wise to keep google fiber out of the city </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of all of the countries to use as an example, you use Australia? They still have a good chunk of the country on dialup since it's such a large region but has only six or so metropolitan areas. Really, America's internet speeds aren't that bad. They're not #1 but I think they were in the top 10. Meanwhile, Australia is still trying to build a fiber network but its own government keeps sabotaging it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>there's little or no competition in most markets. </li>
<li>the cost of starting up puts it out of reach for most companies. Even Google is growing insanely slow due to the cost of laying new lines</li>
<li>we've got other problems. My Internet is reliable (like 95%+ uptime) and fast enough (50 Mb) for just about anything my family of 4 needs for $65 a month. The only way things are going to change is if we make a widespread political effort to change it and frankly, my efforts there are better spent on other issues.     </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speeds are so slow because the telecom industry in America is a monopoly. In certain areas you only have one choice for a provider, so why would they spend money to improve their services if you don't have any other choice?</p>
<p>The telecom industry has been vigorously lobbying and filing lawsuits to prevent competition. Things like poles, switches, and boxes (the kind you find outside) are owned and rented out. Lawsuits have been thrown around to prevent other companies from using those utilities which makes it hard to compete. Telecom companies also sign deals with the cities themselves. If the city attempts to provide their own internet they would get sued. The only reason Google Fiber was able to become a thing is because Google could afford to build their own utilities and fight in court with a chance of winning. The American telecom industry is the poster child of corruption and bad morals and ethics. They are not satisfied with their 97% profit margins and don't care one bit about making the world a better, more connected place.</p>
<p>It is because of Google Fiber that companies like Comcast are finally starting to improve their networks, because it is clear to both sides that the moment Google Fiber is available everybody will jump ship. These companies are fully aware of what they are doing and how damaging they are and are terrified that their monopoly will end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
