<p>Figured out this was my problem for a very long time. Solution was: Get prescription glasses.</p>
<p>I had a very hard time reading various texts or better comprehending what I have just read until I got my first pair of glasses at the age of 20.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was actually just reading a book on this yesterday!</p>
<p>There's so much stuff going on around you that if you were to actually consciously receive all of the data your brain takes in from all five senses it would overload and you'd have a killer headache. In order to mitigate this the brain has something called the human attentional system which makes sure that you pay attention to all the stuff you need to know without looking at every single thing.</p>
<p>The attentional system has four parts: You've got your two modes of consciousness, which are mind-wandering mode and central executive mode, you've got your attentional filter, which is responsible for deciding what you get to passively pay attention to and what you get to ignore, and you've got your attentional switch, which is what changes your brain in between the two modes of consciousness.</p>
<p>Your mind-wandering mode is your brain's default mode, and it's where you are when you're reading a book without getting anything from it. It's a stream-of-consciousness type deal, where neural networks and the thoughts they create connect with each other almost randomly, linked by small similarities that bridge thoughts together. Daydreaming and REM sleep are examples where your brain is almost completely in mind-wandering mode. This is your default mode because when you don't need to be paying attention to anything your brain tries to conserve its energy; <em>just like other parts of your body your brain runs on glucose, and when it runs low it gets tired, and you feel it.</em> That's why it's physically exhausting to take a four-hour exam; focusing takes effort and energy.</p>
<p>You central executive mode is what is popularly considered to be your consciousness: it's the part of your essence that pays direct attention to no more than four or five things at a time and in much more detail than any of the thoughts your mind-wandering mode spawns and connects. When you focus on something you bring it to the forefront of your central executive mind. This can be both voluntary and involuntary. An example of an involuntary focusing is when you hear a really loud noise that <em>your attentional filter has not come to expect as part of your natural environment</em>. It's impossible for you to not think about the sound and/or it's source. That's just the way we were built so we'd run away from scary animal sounds. Voluntary focus is literally when you try to focus on something: reading that book, trying to flip a water bottle perfectly, or reading an unnecessarily long Reddit post.</p>
<p>Your brain tries to conserve energy by staying in its mind-wandering mode whenever its central executive mode is not needed.
It manages this by</p>
<p>A) using its attentional filter, which decides what activates the attentional switch and what doesn't (i.e. what grabs your attention). </p>
<p>B) Delegating tasks to your mind-wandering mode, so that if something is familiar enough <em>you will do it in your sleep!</em> Well not really, but both sleep and these delegated tasks are managed by the same mode.</p>
<p>Your attentional filter works by detecting change. The longer a stimulus is active or the more familiar you are with it in general the less likely it is to grab your attention. If you're in a building right now think about the sound of the air conditioning unit, or the location of your tongue, or what your left middle finger is touching right now, or the fact that your brain will always delegate breathing and blinking to your mind-wandering mode unless you specifically think about it! These are all stimuli or processes that are either very familiar to you or have been present in your current environment for a long time. If it hasn't killed you in the past half hour it's probably not going to kill you now, so why bother giving it attention? Your attentional filter lets through alien or unexpected stimuli so you can decide whether those things will kill you or not.</p>
<p>Now to actually answer your question!</p>
<p>The longer you read a book the longer it remains a part of your environment. Therefore as time goes on your attentional filter will passively block out the book, which means your focus will need to be kept entirely by the central executive mind. This takes effort. Your brain wants to minimize effort, so it looks for ways to make this easier. You are probably a reader extraordinaire, so your brain decides to delegate the reading to your mind-wandering mode. That way you can read with minimal effort and think about something else at the same time. Unfortunately your mind-wandering mode is not very good at processing non-random information, so you just end up reading the words while not actually interpreting them while thinking about something else. So yes, it is due to a lack of focus.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions please ask me! I really like this topic and have the book right on my desk, so I can probably help you out. </p>
<p>Speaking of books, if you want a non-butchered explanation of this I recommend you read <em>An Organized Mind</em> by Daniel J. Levitin, specifically chapter two. But read the whole thing too because it's really cool.</p>
<p>tl;dr: you lose focus</p>
<p>Edit: yes, that's the book I was reading</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're talking about the &quot;keep reading but your mind wanders off&quot; effect. </p>
<p>1) When you're reading something, your brain is connecting content of your memory in a new or less frequently used way (there is also neurological basis for this, called Hebb's Rule: Neurons that are activated as a set are more likely to fire again if another neuron of that set is active). </p>
<p>2) For this to happen you need to be focused on the topic you're trying to read: You should think about the content you're reading, and &quot;do something with it&quot; in your mind (e.g., picture a scene, or try to summarize it internally). These are processes associated (among others) with working memory, and help the connection forming in 1). </p>
<p>3) Now imagine if instead of thinking about the content, your working memory is occupied with other thoughts, daydreams etc.: There are no connections being made in your knowledge base, because you're thinking about other stuff. You may read a page, but its content are never processed in a meaningful way. </p>
<p>It's been a while since I studied up on neuroscience, and therefore I apologise for any mistakes and oversimplifications. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what I can provide neurologically to answer your question, but I definitely know of some psychology stuff that applies. I threw in some extra biochem+physiology stuff after the numbered items.
Neuroscience is a smushed together version of psychology, biochemistry , and physiology so I think this actually might address everything you're looking for. </p>
<p>There are a few concepts to help out here.
1) <em>Cognitive load</em> - We all have a set amount of cognitive power before we have to recharge and go to sleep or take a break. That's important because it underlies the need for our brain to take shortcuts in order to preserve cognitive capacity. The human brain has actually evolved to be really good at taking shortcuts (and some of them can lead us to bad conclusions -- heuristics are an example. An example of a heuristic is the availability heuristic. If you see violence on the TV all the time, you might come to the conclusion that that violent crime is on the rise in the US. This is not supported by facts though; it's just a result of your exposure to the violence on TV which is not representative of the true state of affairs). </p>
<p>Interestingly, due to the expensive learning principle, the more effort it takes to learn something the more likely you are to remember it. But I guess you've got to put that effort in first.

<p>Attitude toward a subject can influence how much effort how approachable something is for you too in addition to how much you retain.

<p>2) <em>Broadbent's Model of Selective Attention and Triesman's Attenuation Model</em> - It was postulated by Broadbent that in an early stage of processing stimuli we have a filter put in to evaluate the importance of stimuli of all sorts. This filter is there to help us reduce cognitive load. Triesman didn't think that that filter happened early on in processing, but he did want to acknowledge he ability to block out other stimuli to focus on one that's important to us. He was inspired to explain the Cocktail Effect which is where you can be talking to someone else at a party, hear your name and turn toward whoever is saying your name. There are also visual correlates to this phenomenon. Source: <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/attention-models.html" target="_blank">https://www.simplypsychology.org/attention-models.html</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect</a> </p>
<p>3) <em>Interest and Retention of Information</em> - interestingly it has been found that attention isn't affected by interest or interesting things. But retention is. A positive correlation between interest and retention was observed. Humans are built to focus on the novel or interesting. It's a way for ancient humans to have not felt like they had to stay in one place forever despite dwindling resources -- we have the propensity to explore and expand. That makes us adaptable in many environments. We can also remember freaky new stuff in our new environments so we can keep surviving (maybe a new animal in a new environment is deadly to us -- uh-oh! Way better to have remembered that easily).

<p>As far as people drinking and not paying as much attention as another poster mentioned...this is because frontal lobe (executive functioning) activity is lowered with the release of GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) as a result of alcohol use (alcohol is a drug remember). Stimuli hit your optic tract and thalamus first and then go to your frontal lobe. Alcohol mucks up your balance/motor skills and probably vision a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if because you're not processing physical input as well due to the GABA inhibitory effects that the signals that hit your parietal lobe (responsible for attention and focus+processing of visual stimuli) aren't so great and the signals from the frontal lobe don't do as well when they're communicated to the hippocampus which helps in learning and memory. I also wouldn't be surprised if you got people to take benzodiazepines or another depressant and saw similar effects.  </p>
<p>Fatigue can lower the control that the frontal lobe exhibits too. Ever been slap happy from lack of sleep? Well, there you go. </p>
<p>&quot;There are at least 5 metabolic causes of fatigue, a decrease in the phosphocreatine level in muscle, proton accumulation in muscle, depletion of the glycogen store in muscle, hypoglycaemia and an increase in the plasma concentration ratio of free tryptophan/branched-chain amino acids.&quot;
Source: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-abstract/48/3/477/297753" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-abstract/48/3/477/297753</a></p>
<p>I know that phosphocreatine is necessary in muscle to help phosphorylate  the kinases that eventually tack on an ATP on myosin heads. Those myosin heads, along with troponin, respond to an influx of Ca2+ into the muscle and that's how you move those muscles. In the process ATP is hydrolysis to ADP and energy is harvested from this conversion. The phosphocreatine shuttle is in the mitochondria even though phosphocreatine comes from the liver and arrives via blood to muscle cells. Phosphocreatine -- important stuff. </p>
<p>I bet that tryptophan and branched chain amino acids are important for some reasons I'll list. Tryptophan is useful for various enzyme pocket stabilizations due to its polar nature and hydrogen bonding capabilities (Nitrogens). If there's an amino acid you'd like to have for some good reactions it's tryptophan. Tryptophan also is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan which is then directly converted to seratonin. Gut serotonin has been shown to help regulate metabolism Source: <a href="https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gastrojournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0016-5085%2815%2900714-3%2Ffulltext&rc=0&code=ygast-site" target="_blank">https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gastrojournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0016-5085%2815%2900714-3%2Ffulltext&rc=0&code=ygast-site</a> </p>
<p>Tryptophan also has some hydrophobic parts which are nice for passing cell membranes (cell membranes have a phosphate head attached to squiggly tails made of triglycerides which are hydrophobic and &quot;like dissolves like&quot;) It's been used to help deliver drugs to rats with Alzheimer's so it can actually weasel its way across the blood brain barrier with some efficacy Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389492/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389492/</a> The BBB is a tough hack (a good thing because your brain is kiiiinda important! Additionally, antibodies are too big to pass through the blood brain barrier. All your brain can do is produce an inflammatory response and swell up which is sort of bad if you've got limited elbow room (read: your skull). It can swell so much that it bruises itself! That's why an infection in the brain is extra no bueno. </p>
<p>Branched chain amino acids participate as intermediates in certain metabolic processes; they're also used to stabilize proteins involved in metabolic regulation Source:<a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/1/207S.full.pdf" target="_blank">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/1/207S.full.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is speculative but I think I might be onto something here. I would have to look more into the mechanism of action to confirm which I'd love to do if anybody requests it!!</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia is low blood sugar which translates to lower glucose in the blood and glucose is everybody's favorite way to get energy by generating ATP through glycolysis, the Citric acid cycle which is then finally followed by electron chain transport. </p>
<p>I'm studying psychology for the MCAT and don't have a degree or further knowledge -- feel free to add on or correct me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently a student studying at University, found a simple [but not easy] way to combat this effect when reading large volumes of books for research...</p>
<p>Every 2-5 pages, close the book and attempt to &quot;recall&quot; the general concept of what you've read, from memory.
This is often referred to as <strong>generation</strong> by some psychologists, it <strong>forces your brain to stay focused</strong> as it's <strong>chemically/physically working</strong> to recall the information you've just read.</p>
<p>You'll find that it'll take you longer to read a book, but after 1 read through (cover to cover) you'll be able to recall upto 50% more of what you've read than someone who hasn't deployed this technique.</p>
<p>My reason for sharing this &quot;hidden secret&quot; of studying is I wish I knew about it when I was younger (sitting my A-Levels) as opposed to discovering it mid-way through my Degree. I could've saved myself so many hours, and attained such higher grades.</p>
