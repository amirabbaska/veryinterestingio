		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another short answer is that certain naturally occurring isotopes with (relatively) short half-lives still exist on earth because the supply of them is being constantly renewed through natural causes.</p>
<p>The first mechanism, as others have mentioned, is due to the isotope being part of the decay chain of other, longer lived isotopes.</p>
<p>Another mechanism that can do this is cosmic rays. The Carbon 14 used in Carbon dating is produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen in the atmosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short:</p>
<p>&quot;The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.5 billion years, uranium-235 about 700 million years, and uranium-234 about 25 thousand years. Uranium atoms decay into other atoms, or radionuclides, that are also radioactive and commonly called &quot;decay products.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Basically you have a combination of factors. </p>
<p>-Really long half-lifes</p>
<p>-HUGE amounts of material</p>
<p>-Material then decays into other radioactive elements.  It takes a long time for a hunk of &quot;random radioactive material,&quot; to actually become stable.  This is called a decay chain:

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there still any naturally occurring isotopes left on Earth if they have short half lives?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't.  Most have really long half-lives.  </p>
<p>Also if you had 100 tons of a material w/ a half life of 100 years, after 1000 years you would still have nearly 1 ton of the original material, and also a bunch of other radioactive goop.  Hence our storage of spent radioactive fuel.  For example TC-99 has a half-life of 220,000 years. So all that spent fuel is in there for the long haul and will likely remain radioactive longer than humanity will exist.  (Unless we leave this planet.  Friendly reminder to support Mars research.)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several different reasons. Consider a few examples:</p>
<p>Uranium-238, Uranium-235, and Potassium-40. All are radioactive enough to twig a geiger counter up a few notches, all are still naturally occurring in not insignificant quantities. But this is because they all have long half-lives, 4.5 billion years for U-238, 0.7 billion years for U-235, and 1.3 billion years for K-40. That means there's half as much U-238 on Earth now than there was when Earth was &quot;born&quot; along with 1.2% as much U-235 and 8.3% as much K-40. Billions of years is a large amount of time, but these are pretty long-lived isotopes.</p>
<p>Consider Carbon-14 however, with a half-life of only 5700 years. None of the Carbon-14 from the early days of Earth is still around, yet it continues to be present in small amounts even so. This is because high energy cosmic rays hitting the Earth's upper atmosphere produce a shower of particles which includes neutrons and these neutrons can hit Nitrogen-14 atoms, turning them into Carbon-14 atoms after the emission of a proton. So there's a natural process constantly producing Carbon-14 and creating an equilibrium abundance of it in trace quantities at a given level of background cosmic radiation.</p>
<p>Consider Radon-222, Radium-226, and Helium. Helium is stable, but it doesn't typically last very long in the Earth's atmosphere because it has a tendency to drift higher and higher into the upper atmosphere and then get lost to interplanetary space. However, there's still Helium in Earth's atmosphere and there are natural sources of Helium (underground). This is because an alpha particle is just a Helium-4 nucleus, so alpha emitting radioisotopes will produce Helium in their environment as the alpha particles eventually lose energy and mate up with electrons, if they end up in a location where they can't easily escape to the surface (such as a geological formation that would also trap natural gas) then they can remain there in reasonably high concentrations for many millions of years. This is indeed where Helium comes from industrially, as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. Radon also exists naturally and can be quite dangerous to humans in certain environments, and yet it has only a 3.8 day half-life. Radium-226 also exists naturally but it has a half-life of only 1600 years (shorter even than Carbon-14). But both exist in the &quot;decay chain&quot; of naturally occurring Uranium/Thorium isotopes. As long as there's still Uranium-238 around there will be some amount of Ra-226 and Rn-222. This is actually a big factor in the radioactivity of naturally occurring Uranium, because U-238 isn't that radioactive on its own, but as it decays it builds up amounts of faster decaying and more radioactive isotopes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long-lived radioactive elements decay into other radioactive elements on their way to becoming lead.</p>
<p>For example, Thorium 232, which has a half life of 10.405 billion years, decays into Radon 228, which has a half life of 5.75 years.</p>
<p>Or Uranium 238, with a half life of 4.6 billion years, decays into Thorium 234, with a half-life of 24 days, then to Protactinium with a half-life of a minute and six seconds.</p>
<p>They keep going.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many isotopes are created on a regular basis.  Sources include</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Other things decaying into them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other things fissioning into them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other things fusioning into them.  This includes supernovas.</p>
</li>
<li>Random interactions with other particles: Alphas/betas/Gammas/Neutrons.  Any of these can potentially turn a stable isotope into an unstable one.  I don't mention neutrinos and other particles of that nature because they have such a low chance of interaction with other particles.  Some could conceivably pass through a block of lead a lightyear long on each side without any interactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>On point 1, it doesn't matter if an isotope has a short halflife in the range of seconds or less, if it's produced by something with a long halflife decaying, then it will pretty much always exist in some percentage in nature.</p>
<p>Some halflives are so long that they're considered primordial.  Like that particular chunk of isotope was there for the creation of the galaxy/universe, and it's still here.  It could conceivably still be here at the end of the galaxy/universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
