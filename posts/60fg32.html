		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that it is 1920 (so, no GPS other satellites). You have just found a island in the Pacific and want to know where it goes on the map. There are two things you would need to figure out to do that: how far north or south is the island, and how far east or west it is. One way to do this is by sighting the stars.</p>
<p>The stars look like they are fixed to a sort of celestial sphere that rotates around the Earth, with its axis of rotation going through our north and south poles. By looking at the north-south positions of the stars, you can figure out how tilted the celestial sphere appears to be from your position, which tells you how far north you are. For instance, if you see the North Star, you can almost directly read your north-south position. If it's overhead, you're close to the North Pole, and if it's on the horizon, your near the equator.</p>
<p>Determining your latitude (east-west) [EDIT: sorry, that should be longitude] position is much more tricky, and there is a long history concerning it, but it basically boils down to clocks. As the celestial sphere spins in sky, the stars will appear to be in different positions east or west depending on how far east or west you are. If you have an accurate clock and a star chart, you can determine where the stars would be at that time if you were at a reference point on the Earth (for instance Greenwich, England). Looking at where the stars actually are in your sky at that time, you can determine how far east or west you are.</p>
<p>A book that's well worth a read on this subject is <em>Longitude</em>. It discussed the problems and history of determining your position while navigating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cartography is a very complicated issue. That's why the old maps sometimes look a bit off. Once navigational instruments were perfected (compass, sextant, telescopes, -cartography is  closely related to astronomy-), it was very &quot;easy&quot; to position coastlines on a map. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography#/media/File:TabulaRogeriana_upside-down.jpg" target="_blank">This map</a> is ~ 900 years old, you can see that Italy is very... imaginative. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Fern%C3%A3o_Vaz_Dourado_1571-1.jpg" target="_blank">This one</a> not yet 500. Every single line on it has a meaning. It's a bit off, but it's not bad. As soon as latitudes and (the harder to measure) longitudes could be correctly measured, drawing maps was not (as) hard. </p>
<p>It must be said that drawing on a map (flat) what the Earth (round) looks like remains a very complicated task.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century things got a lot better. Aerial photography (balloons, planes). After that, satellites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had maps.  Since at least the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Triangulation_of_Great_Britain" target="_blank">18th century</a>, we've been able to create extremely detailed maps via trigonometric surveys.  It's similar to the surveyors you'll sometimes see around roads and land development.  </p>
<p>Basically, one person stands in a known location and another person stands in the location you want to measure.  Then you can measure the distance and angles between the two locations and use trigonometry to plot the new location accurately on a map.  Then you go to the location you just measured and measure a new location.  You keep doing that until you've measured an entire country or continent.</p>
<p>Placing those maps onto a globe is just a matter of knowing the latitude and longitude of one of those locations we measured.  Someone else posted about how we were able to measure Latitude and Longitude, but we've been able to do if fairly accurately at least since the middle of the 19th century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>basically you had a lot of surveyors go around and make very accurate measurements and thous create maps out from this.</p>
<p>also i would like to point out high altitude flying was a thing before space satellites with cameras.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
