		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, take a look at the emission spectrum in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Black_body.svg" target="_blank">this</a> diagram. Notice how as you increase the temperature, the amount of energy emitted increases for <em>all</em> wavelengths of light. For example, look at the line for 2 um wavelength: as you increase temperature from 3000-&gt;4000-&gt;5000 k, each time, the emission from this wavelength increases. This is <em>always</em> the case. For this reason, if you take the spectrum of the hottest stars in the universe, they emit massive amounts of UV- most of their energy could be in UV- but they will still emit more visible light than the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it wouldn't be possible. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Black_body.svg/600px-Black_body.svg.png" target="_blank">Look at this plot</a>, what you can see is that for increasing temperatures the peak of the distribution is indead shifted towards smaller wavelengths. For high temperatures the peak will eventually not be in the visible spectrum anymore. But notice how the rest of the curve increases. For higher temperatures, the curve will not go down, but keep increasing. </p>
<p>Mathematically you can see this by taking the derivative of the planck function with respect to temperature. Since hc/(lambda*kT)&gt;0 for all possible lambda and T, the derivative will be greater than 0. Lambda and T can of course never be negative (excluding the special conditions when negative temperatures can occur). </p>
<p>Edit: For all of you who don't know about negative temperatures, see <a href="http://rantonels.github.io/capq/q/TD1.html" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars produce energy across most ends of the spectrum, if not all.</p>
<p>Hotter stars produce more energy from a higher range, but they still produce lower energy radiation as well. As far as we know, no star produces high or low energy exclusively, so there's always some visible light.</p>
<p>Is it possible? Maybe a low energy star could fail to produce high enough radiation to see with the naked eye, but it's unlikely and borderline impossible for <em>all</em> of a star's energy to be too high to see. Most, maybe. But not all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not from black body radiation alone at least.</p>
<p>See, hotter objects will have their most prominent light shift into UV and beyond. BUT, they will never lose any radiance of any frequency of light as it goes hotter, they will only get brighter across all frequencies.</p>
<p>Meaning, if our sun is ten times hotter than it actually is, it would have produced even more red light, even though red light is now more of a minority in the overall spectra, as the UV, X, and Gamma rays muscle in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Neutrons stars are incredibly hot, but also incredibly small and dense. Due to this, the vast majority of the energy given off by them is in the form of x-rays, gamma rays, and short wavelength ultraviolet.  However, due to their small size of tens of km, the amount of visible light is minuscule, and they are difficult to see even with telescopes. Mainly, they are visible by the fact that the x-rays given off ionize nearby gases causing those gases to glow in the visible range.</p>
<p>However, Seen in x-rays, they may be incredibly luminous compared to the rest of the sky. One example is the Vela pulsar.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that they don't give off visible light.</p>
<p>However, if a pulsar were to come close enough to the earth that it would be clearly visible to the eye, it would be way too close. The x-rays and ultraviolet given off would destroy the ozone layer and then sterilize the Earth's surface. Only undersea life would be safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
