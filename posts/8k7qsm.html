		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a private room where a person asks them to recap what happened, and films it. Then they take that segment of film and splice it between different segments of events so that you get the feel that they're narrating what's going through their head as it's happening in real time.</p>
<p>It helps that reality show contestants are often vetted by how dramatic and camera-friendly they can be. That's why you see more of the people who are abrasive and irritating and less of the quiet, shy types. You'll end up with way more footage of some hammy loudmouth than someone who mumbles into their shirt and can't remember what happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They will line everybody up and then tell them itâ€™ll be another 15 minutes before the lighting is right.   Then, with cameras rolling, they get shots of people being annoyed or whatever.  BOOM.  Drama!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In any reality show, interviews are done either end of day or on a separate day. Producers take good notes so they can interview the contestants about every detail. They answer in present tense to keep you in the moment.</p>
<p>Every show is different. They aren't scripted, unless it is a &quot;reality sitcom&quot; type show. They will get the interviewees to answer in short sound bite versions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
