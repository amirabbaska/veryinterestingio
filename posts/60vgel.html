		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question – one that probably every paleontologist has asked themselves numerous times. My realm of knowledge (and livelihood) lies in zoology, but with a great interest, and some understanding of paleontology as well, I can make an educated guess. Of course it’s just my theory, and lots of others have perfectly good theories of their own. Here, goes…
The Cretaceous extinction killed off maybe up to 75 percent of life on the planet, and effected marine life as well as land animals, so it was clearly a global phenomenon. That said, we have to imagine things spread out and living in all geographic locations and under all conditions possible. Some of those locations and conditions will be more favorable than others, and something will be there to take advantage when disaster strikes. What is favored? I can think of two things in general.
First, animals that are generalists, or otherwise tolerant of a wide variety of diets and living conditions will have the advantage of being able to “get by” when they can’t find their preferences. Critters that have very specific needs run the risk of losing something they need to survive. A lot of sharks probably went extinct, but some were generalist/scavengers that could get by on whatever they found to eat. Some mosasaurs had specialized teeth, suggesting a specific diet. Maybe the other marine reptiles did as well. Who knows? They’re all gone.
Secondly, animals that lived in ideal locations had an advantage over those that did not. Plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, and other marine reptiles descended from land animals, and were subject to some constraints that sharks and bony fishes were not (such as breathing under water). It was sort of an extreme lifestyle for a reptile. As successful as sharks have been, they were probably poised to exploit areas that the reptiles couldn’t. Think of the dinosaurs. Which ones survived? The survivors were the flying ones (birds), which could reach food, water, shelter, or whatever the situation called for. Location, location, location! According to the Smithsonian NMH Ocean Portal (<a href="http://ocean.si.edu/sharks" target="_blank">http://ocean.si.edu/sharks</a>), sharks “are found in just about every kind of ocean habitat, including the deep sea, open ocean, coral reefs, and under the Arctic ice.” It is likely that wherever the ocean was least affected by the disaster, there were sharks already there to take advantage and survive.
A little wordy, but that’s my take on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One think one must realize that the K-PG extinction did not kill the dinosaurs, or the pterosaurs, or the mosasaurs. It killed <em>most of everything</em>.</p>
<p>All non-avain dinosaurs went extinct.<br />
Most avian dinosaurs went extinct. IIRC, we nowadays think that all modern birds are descended from 6 lineages that made it through the asteroid.
Most mammals went extinct.<br />
Most non-dinosaurian reptiles went extinct.</p>
<p>Generally, the things that survived were rather small organisms from very broad groups. Being small helps alot to keep the population size above extinction levels when the carrying capacity of the environment plummets.</p>
<p>Sharks made it through because there were lots of sharks in the oceans. And there was no Megalodon at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Shark&quot; is a large group (specifically superorder <em>Selachimorpha</em>) of cartilaginous fish.  Saying that sharks existed at the same time as dinosaurs isn't terribly different than saying mammals existed at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The food of the mosasaur and plesiosaur went extinct (ammonoids) with the extinction event so they did too. Sharks didn't eat these so were able to survive and pull through as they ate smaller fish which were not impacted as severely as the ammonoids. One reason for ammonoids going extinct and fish not doing so is that ammonoids had larvae for young living in the surface waters almost planktonically unlike new born fish. Some aspect of the extinction event likely harmed these larvae more so than the fish. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over millions and millions of years the chemical composition of gasses in the atmosphere and water change and one of these important gasses is oxygen which plays a role in how big a species can evolve to be and still survive. Oxygen levels are much lower in our atmosphere than they were during the lives of mesosaurus and Plesiosaurus. Our atm today is not well suited to provide high levels of oxygen for larger animals to exist. This could explain why after a certain point in our biological history you don't see a resurgence of many larger animals,  as we are truly a product of our environments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
