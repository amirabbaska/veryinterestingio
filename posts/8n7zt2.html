These hormones work to conserve water in the kidney as well; once you drink the water your body is already anticipating its effects!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The body doesnt actually hydrate that fast, BUT the body can tell when you are drinking fluids, and will anticipate the body responses in ADVANCE of actual processing! Like getting a call that you inlaws are coming , you automatically pick up the house and clean it, even before they get there so that WHEN they do actually get there, your house is fantastic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As everybody else has said, your body reacts in anticipation of what your mouth tells it is on the way.  There was a cool Radiolab segment on this a while back - how the body apparently has a sort of &quot;energy governor&quot; that sends out pain signals to keep you from using up all of your body's energy and dying.  But it's pretty conservative, so you can trick it by simply swishing some energy drink in your mouth and spitting it out.  Once the body thinks that more energy is on the way, it releases some of those reserves.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually has a lot to do with your taste buds and other receptors in your tongue/mouth. As soon as any kind of food or liquid enters your mouth, it starts being broken down by saliva and analyzed for content. Your body will then start to respond appropriately before it has even fully consumed that food. For example, if you were to drink a Gatorade, your body will start amping up production of electrolytes in anticipation of the replenishment from the Gatorade. However, simply swishing the Gatorade around in your mouth for a few moments will trick your body into pumping out electrolytes for a short while before it realizes there isn't anything with which to replenish. In your case, the typical symptoms of dehydration are your body's indication that it needs water. As soon as it starts to get some, it will start to alleviate those symptoms before it has completely absorbed all the water into your system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I went to JROTC summer camp in high school and a girl adamantly refused to drink her water when we were doing a map reading/navigation exercise to see if we could find our way out of the middle of a large wooded area. Eventually the PFC assigned to our squad stopped the whole squad and said were not moving until you drink. The girl with an attitude took a swig of her canteen and then a few seconds later passed out. We ended up emptying canteens on her to try to get her cooled off while we waited for the medic to get there with an IV.</p>
<p>A few of the mottos they had us remember.</p>
<p>“Drink water, it’s cool!”
“See a snake? Put on the brake!”</p>
<p>I don’t remember the rest. Fun times though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
