		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the more hoops one has to go through to vote, the fewer people will want to subject themselves to go through the process. But I don't fully understand how voter ID laws suppress minorities specifically, or how they're more suppressive than requiring voters to show up in person at the booths (instead of online voting, for example). </p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not trying to get into a political debate here, I'm looking for the pros and cons of both sides. Please don't put answers like &quot;Republicans are trying to suppress minority votes&quot; as the answer, I'm trying to find out <em>how</em> this policy suppresses votes.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay....Now I understand what people mean when they say RIP inbox...thank you so much for this kind of response, wish me luck, I'm gonna try and wade through all of this...</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of laws that affect everyone can be used to specifically target groups that are disproportionately unlikely to be able to follow them. The more hoops that a person has to go through, the more that a lack of education or a lack of time could stop them. The lack of education thing is important because someone with some college or even just a high school diploma is far more likely to have the patience to deal with large volumes of paperwork.</p>
<p>I have a college education, which means I only have to work one job. I have the time and attention span to jump through lots of hoops to be able to vote. Others with less education or in worse financial situations are less likely to have the time or motivation to go through the long and arduous process that registering to vote could be.</p>
<p>As an anecdotal example, when my wife and I (white US citizens in our mid-20's) first moved to this state (Virginia), she wound up having to take 4 trips to the DMV to be fully registered to vote, which was incredibly tedious and discouraging. If she weren't so determined to exercise her rights, she would have stopped once she got her drivers license. This wasn't even due to excessive laws in the state, it was just the DMV. If she had to work 2 jobs (more likely for minorities) or if we had family relying on us (more likely for minorities) or if she had less education (more likely for minorities) then this process could have likely stopped her early.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it's all about the kinds of people more likely to be lost at every hurdle. A law doesn't need to directly target minorities to disproportionately hurt them. </p>
<p>EDIT: To clear up a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm not talking about total suppression of some minorities. Making some part of the process slightly more difficult will not block out an entire group. But if a law is put in place that stops 1% of the rich and 5% of the poor, then it is disproportionately hurting the poor. It doesn't take much to do this, and it often doesn't take much to tip the scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife's situation was made worse by a fuck-up at the DMV. There were no extra laws getting in her way, but the process was made much more difficult regardless. This is an anecdotal point and only serves as an example of how simple little issues can prevent less motivated people from registering. I don't believe that her situation represents the majority of people in Virginia. </p>
</li>
<li>As a lot of people have brought up, I'm improperly using the term &quot;minorities&quot;. The group that I'm referring to is really anyone who is not part of the social or financial elite who may be disenfranchised by laws that make voting more difficult for everyone. Most of this group is poor, and is disproportionately non-white, hence my misusing the term. Plenty of white people are affected negatively by increased difficulty in voting, and plenty of racial minorities are not affected by it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a simple example to explain how voter ID laws can suppress votes from 2012...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many ID-issuing offices maintain limited business hours. For example, the office in Sauk City, Wisconsin is open only on the fifth Wednesday of any month. But only four months in 2012 — February, May, August, and October — have five Wednesdays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the office for non-driving voter ID.  If you want a drivers license (has a fee), you can get one at any DMV, however only select locations with obscure and select hours offered the free ID.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Canada and I actually have experience working as a deputy returning officer for a provincial election a couple years ago. </p>
<p>When I was working, I required that people had at least one of three things in order for them to vote.</p>
<p>a) A voting card, the card had 5 or 6 digit numeric code on it, used for the purposes of identifying the voter. They were mailed out to addresses prior to the election based on census data and other info collected (for example, when you received an ID/Drivers license, you have to provide an address)</p>
<p>b) If they didn't have a voter card, they had to fill a one page form so that they could be entered into the system. I would enter this information in to ensure that they didn't vote twice and wouldn't have to deal with this during the next election.</p>
<p>c) If they had no form of ID, and no voter form, they also had to fill out a declaration stating that they are who they are, and if they lied about the information provided, they could be charged under the elections act.</p>
<p>Voter ID really wasn't that bad. It was the people, primarily older folks who were the pain. They would have no voter card, and did wish to provide any form of ID or sign any form to vote. Eventually when they realized that we were not going to allow them to vote if they did not comply, did they produce their driver's license.</p>
<p>In my experience, the DMV in Nova Scotia is normally open until 7pm and getting an ID costs max $15. As well we also took birth certificates, and even registered mail as proof. You don't actually need ID to vote here, but if you do, it makes the process significantly easier.</p>
<p>Voter turnout for that election I worked was 59% which was unchanged from the previous eleciton, in comparison, voter turnout in the last Presidential election was 55%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this entire issue should be simplified that way no one can complain of fraudulent votes.  In order to vote, you would need an ID, plain and simple.</p>
<p>But make it super super simple to get one.  When a citizen turns 18, send them a free ID.  If they do not have a registered address, that's another issue obviously, but then they should send an official out to find the person to get them the ID.</p>
<p>I don't want to oversimplify the issue, but voting is one of the biggest hallmarks of our society, and the nation should do everything it can to make it the easiest and most legitimate process possible.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start,  ID in the US isn't required for day to day life so not everyone has one. </p>
<p>ID cost money to obtain which means the poorest citizens often don't bother because they need that money for other things. </p>
<p>ID also has to be obtained at specific locations which means those who are not living near one of these locations must find a means of travel to go get an ID.  Again the poor often don't have access to the transportation needed to get the ID. Even those in cities who are poor,   often can't take the time or money to get an ID due to life situations. </p>
<p>Therefore those who are poor or in rural areas without transportation to where they can get ID are unable to vote as a result. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
