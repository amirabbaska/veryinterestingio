		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I woke up to a variety of informative responses! Thanks guys! A common factor, it seems, that effects the poor is taxes. I'm young and don't have a house, but I honestly forgot about property taxes. Holy crap, how is that fair? A couple makes it their goal to purchase a home and raise their family and once they buy their house they have to pay an enormous amount in annual property taxes. Why?! That's just crazy to me! Does one get any of that back when filing their taxes? Do people who are past retirement age have to still pay those property taxes? A state like Sourh Dakota, who has no property taxes, how do they recoup that loss or is it just an altruistic motive by the state? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Artist: I make like no money making art. I bet I could live in some old warehouse in a near-abandoned district of the city with 20 other artists for almost no money and still make ends meet as an artist, though!</p>
<p><strong>20 artists move into warehouse not really zoned for residence, share a single 100-year old bathroom for 20 years, paint the walls with murals, and make quirky furniture out of garbage they find in the streets. They also paint the walls and sidewalks around the area because no one gives a shit about the area, but artists be like &quot;fuck it, lez make it pretty! ^_^&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>Musician: Man, I'm barely making any money playing music because I'm not a top 40 chart topper. But that new warehouse district seems pretty cheap, bet me and 15 musician buddies could live out our dreams there!</p>
<p><strong>Musicians move into another warehouse. Maybe nightly bizarre concerts aka people playing music in warehouses at 3 am while smoking cheap weed while other people paint with their bodies on the walls start occurring.</strong></p>
<p>Writer/Poet: There's just no place in the world for struggling writers unless you sell out to Hollywood or some shit. Where can I struggle to be the next Bukowski for a decade or two, drink cheap beer, starve myself and have raunchy sex with artists while listening to bizarre music at 3 am every night? Oh hey, I've heard about that still-pretty-cheap warehouse district! I bet me and 20 of my writer/poet friends could live in one of those hollowed out warehouse rooms there for cheap!</p>
<p><strong>Writer/poets move in; open a &quot;coffee shop&quot; sort of a makeshift space in one of the warehouses with water they can filter through a complex series of cloth slow drips that the writers are more addicted to than crack because writers need coffee shops real bad. It becomes a bit of a community hub, though. It inspired some local co-op gardening projects as well.</strong></p>
<p>Kid with $10 million Trust Fund: I need to move to a cool part of the city, that weird warehouse district is pretty cool, totally counterculture! I guess I can buy a floor of a warehouse and remodel it kind of or something.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee shop improves because trust fund kids buy $20,000 espresso machine and water filtration system for it.</strong></p>
<p>Young Professional who managed to land good-paying jobs out of college: I really want to be cool even though I have to work this corporate gig all day. I bet I could buy a loft-sized part of one of those old warehouses and remodel it and it would be cheap as fuck for me, plus that area is pretty dope!</p>
<p><strong>Warehouses now consistently selling in loft-sized units. Over half of the community is made up of trust fund kids and young professionals. There is an organic vegetable co-op that makes deliveries to everyone, the coffee shop has stable walls, and actual cups. There's a cafe that actually makes food for people. The concerts are beginning to get scheduled and start to appear in major newspapers as &quot;hip events&quot; in the city.</strong></p>
<p>Real Estate Developer: Hey, the ROI on converting these old warehouses into neo-luxury lofts is like 10,000%, I should buy up these warehouses and turn them into neo-luxury lofts!</p>
<p><strong>Average person living in the area now pays $5,000/month for a super hip loft in a remodeled warehouse that they live in alone, instead of being 1 of 20 people in an illegal warehouse floor. The artists, musicians, and writers don't live there anymore, except maybe 5% of them who somehow made a bunch of money by selling their art to the trust fund kids, or randomed their way into a 9.3 review on Pitchfork media because someone recorded them randomly playing in a warehouse. There are several high-end coffee shops carefully crafted with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Dutch wood paneling and several of the cities hottest new restaurants have opened. It is paradise, and real-estate values are skyrocketing.</strong></p>
<p>Foreign investors: Real estate prices in that warehouse district in X City are skyrocketing! I should buy up as many lofts as possible to protect my massive fortune!</p>
<p>Fin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gentrification is when lower cost, lower income neighborhoods are taken over by those with higher income, which raises real estate prices and rents and forces many of the previous residents out. It often also forces existing businesses out and sees them replaced by higher end and/or chains.</p>
<p>The typical pattern is that low income but trendy people, ie. the cliche starving artists, or unknown musicians, etc. will discover an area's cheap rents, loft spaces, bars with cheap booze. As they move in, so too do the coffee shops, thrift stores, record stores, and edgy restaurants that cater to these types (think vegan diner, no frills ethnic places). Middle income creative types (graphic designers, architects) discover these areas when attending some live music event or restaurant and notice the nice bones of the older, worn real estate. They start buying buildings and rehabbing them. Landlords start fixing up apartments to charge higher rents. Un-savable and ugly buildings get torn down and new buildings go up.</p>
<p>The minority businesses there before the artists can't afford the higher rents, so the ethnic salon or bodega close. Starbucks, cocktail bars, and Dr. Martin open stores. Even longtime home owners have trouble staying as rising home values mean property taxes outpace their income. A farmers market starts up, the local park gets rehabed. Yuppie families who can't afford homes in the upscale areas of town start discovering they can get more space in the gentrifying area, plus it makes them look cooler. Boutiques and baby stores pop up, as well as trendy furniture places. The vegan diner close, and Chipotle opens in its place.</p>
<p>It'd both good and bad. It cleans up rough parts of town and expands the amount of nicer areas that people with more income want to live. But it's bad because it displaces others who cannot afford to stay, and who see their community broken up. Often those who helped get the ball rolling by making it somewhat safer (cleaning parks, neighborhood watch) then cannot stay to enjoy the benefits of their efforts. Also, it's most often wealthy whites forcing out poor minorities, so there is the perception of the strong fighting the weak. And too often, independent businesses are put out of business and replaced by generic chains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about urban gentrification, so I'll touch on my experience with rural gentrification.</p>
<p>I live in a village with a majority elderly working population. People are very poor, and they are being driven out from their homes by these outsiders looking for a nice holiday home in the heartland. The government's response is that this is a good thing, and they offer no benefits for the village to ease this transition.</p>
<p>We don't buy houses here. We inherit them. You're born in the house, you grow up here, you move to the nearby town or one of the larger villages for work, and when your parents are too old to go to work you move back into the home you grew up in, and when your parents die it becomes your house. </p>
<p>Now when parents die, rich city families swoop in. The vultures buy out the property and set about turning it into their holiday home. I can't say I'd be upset if this happens to me: I've got higher aspirations for my life than living in rural England for the rest of my days. But this threatens the village community. </p>
<p>The city folk don't enrol their children in the village school, they send them to a private academy about thirty miles away. The school is going to close in a few years because there's not enough children. The city folk bomb through the village at high speed, and during the school run they try to muscle people out of the road with their America-sized Range Rovers. They don't take part in the village politics unless they are complaining about something, like the Yewtree in the churchyard dropping quills and berries on their softtop, the farmer &quot;trespassing&quot; when he closes their gate to stop his cows from going in when he drives them through the village, the constant smell of muck in the air in spring, the farmers going to work at five in the morning, the Army marching through the village on training, or the children walking home from school for lunch (that's now a thing of the past unfortunately).</p>
<p>Used to be a time when you knew your neighbour. Used to be a time when you'd just walk round your neighbours if they were having a do in the garden and provided you brought a bottle you'd be welcome. Used to be a time when if your hens or ducks or rabbits went into their garden, you could just hop over the wall and get them back. Used to be a time when you could speak your mind without some soft skinned city sod squalling about racism or sexism or bigotry when it doesn't exist (best example: we're apparently racist for the Gurkhas living in a separate housing community than the rest of the village. It's not our decision where the Army builds their houses).</p>
<p>Our families have lived here for a thousand years. These outsiders only live here a few weeks a year, a couple of months in the summer at most. This village is our home, not some rich boy's hobby. Bankers driving beemers and Audis are not welcome here. </p>
<p>How do you think it makes us feel when people with more money than sense or decency walk around our home, looking down on us for being too poor to own a car when they have three?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL/DR; Gentrification is when property values increase to a point that people cannot afford to live in their homes anymore. The key feature that makes gentrification &quot;bad&quot; is that at a certain point (A-3 below) people don't have a choice but to sell their home and move. It is a result of market forces of property value, but it also follows racial lines with white/asians forcing blacks/hispanics out of their houses.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Gentrification is a result of three things:</p>
<p>1) The value of a property goes up when the neighborhood around it is nicer;</p>
<p>2) The taxes you pay for a property go up when the value of the property goes up;</p>
<p>3) If a property owner is paying more in taxes, they will charge more in rent to cover the cost.</p>
<p>...so if enough buildings in a poor neighborhood renovate, then the price of all buildings in the area go up. This has several outcomes:</p>
<p>A-1) People who own property in the area are more likely to sell. The increased value of their lot means that they get more than they paid for it. Why not move to another neighborhood and pocket a few thousand in profit?</p>
<p>A-2) Because more people are willing to sell their property, more property is bought up, renovated, and then sold/leased. This starts to attract real-estate investors and developers who greatly speed up the process. This creates a cycle of increasing value, increasing taxes, and increases in rent.</p>
<p>A-3) For people who don't want to sell their house, the value of their property increases as the buildings in the neighborhood are renovated. This means that rent prices increase, and for property owners there are more taxes to pay. At this point, many people don't have a choice about moving out; they can't afford to live here any longer.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>B-1) Businesses and local economies collapse. As higher-wage individuals move in, they don't buy the same products or shop in the same places as the lower-income individuals who moved out. Local businesses have to pay higher rent for their location, and also have fewer customers.</p>
<p>B-2) As businesses move out, their locations are bought up by businesses that cater to the new, slightly higher-income residents. They sell different products, and so the culture of the location changes.</p>
<p>B-3) As old businesses close down and move, they have to fire their employees. If these individuals can't find work at the new businesses then they are forced to sell their homes, feeding the cycle.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Now on one hand all this can be explained through market forces, but on the other hand American economic strata follow racial lines. There are more blacks and hispanics in poverty, and more whites and asians in the middle and upper class. So as gentrification progresses, a neighborhood typically goes from black/hispanic to asian/white.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the only people who benefit from gentrification are the people who own the property in the first place. Property owners typically make money by either selling their property for more than they paid for it, or by charging higher rent. For the poorest people in the neighborhood - those that rent or in government subsidized housing - they are forced to move out because of the increased cost of renting, but they don't have anything to sell. They are just kicked to the curb. Disproportionately these are minorities, elderly, or mentally disabled people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
