		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is probably pretty unsatisfying: because that's the way it is.  There is no reason that light, energy and everything else <em>has</em> to move in waves.  In fact, some really smart people (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light#Sir_Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>) initially thought that light was just particles that moved in a straight line.</p>
<p>However, eventually we observed phenomena like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction" target="_blank">diffraction</a>, which posed a serious problem for the idea that light is just a bunch of particles flying through the air.  However, diffraction and other such phenomena are easily explained if light is a wave.  </p>
<p>So light must be a wave?  Not so.  Albert Einstein came along and solve the problem of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect" target="_blank">photoelectric effect</a>, which he did by assuming that, instead of waves, light actually <em>was</em> just particles flying around.  </p>
<p>So who's right?  Those who observed diffraction and said light must therefore be waves?  Or those who observed the photoelectric effect, and said that light must therefore be particles?  The answer is, both and neither.  And an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="_blank">experiment</a> was done that showed just that.  Turns out, light is not a wave, although it acts like a wave sometimes.  And light is not a particle, although it also acts like a particle.  It's something totally different.</p>
<p>All mass and energy in the universe is now understood to have wavelike and particle-like behavior.  So no, there is no way to transfer energy that avoids the wave-like nature of mass-energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Waves are a metaphor we invented, to describe the way that forces travel through space -- from one spot to all the adjacent spots, or all the adjacent spots in a particular direction.</p>
<p>The way our universe works, forces always travel through space. Many (like magnetism and gravity) spread at the speed of light, though some (like sound) spread much more slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really waves but something else entirely. They behave according to an equation that sometimes acts like a particle and sometimes a wave- it’s just a quantum oscillation. The reason it does is because it does. All we really try to explain is the what not the why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When particles of any type of energy are emitted from a common source, they knock into the fabric of space, which although it may seem empty, is actually full of 'space' particles.</p>
<p>Whilst seemingly invisible, space particles react to all types of energy particles, such that when space particles are struck by an energy particle, a particle of the same type and magnitude is ejected from the diametrically opposite side of the space particle. Like a 3-D domino effect.</p>
<p>Resulting in what seems like a continuous stream of the energy particles. As the stream of energy particles reach a harmony, the resulting harmony becomes a wave with a frequency.</p>
<p>Different energy particles have different frequencies and move through space at their allocated speed. For instance, a neutrino could travel through 16 trillion light years of steel as if it wasn't even there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If not waves it would be pulses. Square hard pulses. And that’s not very good. </p>
<p>Hard pulses are pure noise. They are a sum of infinite harmonics. A big mess</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
