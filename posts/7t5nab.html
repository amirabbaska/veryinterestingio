		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of animals use sight as an important tool. For instance, hunting. As such, being aware that something is looking at you can be important. Whether it is to know you are attracting the attention of a predator (freezing when a cat looks at you), or getting noticed by prey (like a cat pausing in its stalk). Even though it isn't being used to necessarily convey an expression, it contains important information, like &quot;danger!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although many animals do not have a wide array of facial expressions, many animals will find other ways of communicating with each other. Some birds, for instance, will bob their heads up and down at each other to indicate that they're not trying to be threatening. It's sort of a proto-dance. It's fun to do at parrots, who, I've found, will often look at you suspiciously for a few seconds and then start bobbing their heads back at you. Eye contact is critical to make sure that both parties want peace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the cats I've owned have made eye contact. Usually when they want attention, reassurance, fed or let outdoors.
Once they have your eye contact, they'll often let you pet them for a moment before using body language to tell you what they want. E.g. my cat will keep looking at me and then the door if it wants out. Or it will attempt to lead me to where the food is stored by walking back and forth to 'show' me where it is. Their time keeping is pretty good too. Always seem to know when it's dinner time. It's so much fun!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've a related question. Cats supposedly view eye contact as threatening or intimidating, but my cat seems to use it a little differently. Sometimes when I'm on the computer or something, she'll come stand next to my chair and stare up at me but not jump into my lap until I make eye contact. Similarly, she will sometimes be at one end of the room while I'm at the other, and suddenly approach only the moment when eye contact is made. Generally, she never seems bothered by eye contact, instead becoming far more familiar once it's been made.</p>
<p>Is this Pavlovian or is she just a weird-ass cat?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two points I'm not seeing well represented:</p>
<p>1) Many animals do make eye contact, but they aren't looking for the same things you are when you do it. For many, staring at another animal is a sign of dominance or, sometimes, aggression. So when they look at you, they're looking to see if you look away. Their reaction to you holding their gaze usually depends on where they feel you are in the hierarchy compared to them.</p>
<p>2) Some animals learn to read human expressions, even though that's not natural among themselves. Dogs, for instance naturally have the trait above (eye contact is dominance). They also show their teeth as a sign of aggression or warning. But we make eye contact,  smile, and show our teeth when we're happy. Pet dogs figure that out. Still, if you hold eye contact with your own dog, it will likely look away. If you do it with a dog you don't know, it will probably get mad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
