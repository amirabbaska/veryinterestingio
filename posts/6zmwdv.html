<p>If the argument is that the &quot;US would never use it&quot; then why was it developed in the first place?</p></div></div>

<p>Who was going to sanction the largest economy in the world and political and military head of NATO during the cold war? Who would benefit from that? Why would anyone politically aligned with the US want to risk that relationship over a hypothetical bomb?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two parts to this: first one is the fact that it was developed back when sanctions for such things weren't, well, a thing. Back then everyone was going crazy about becoming nuclear.</p>
<p>Second, it wasn't developed in the sense that &quot;it would never be used&quot; but, rather, in the sense that they wouldn't use it first. It's there as a deterrent for other nations that would attempt to pull such a stunt in the first place. Or, more precisely, Russia at the time.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not american. And I think such weapons are a terrible, terrible idea. However, just because YOU play by the rules, doesn't mean others will.</p>
<p>So it's all quite nuanced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sanctions don't really work towards more powerful countries.</p>
<p>Look at what's happening when US is trying to hit Russia with sanctions, Russia of course will not accept/admit that US is the more powerful and yield to the sanction but rather apply counter sanctions towards US. </p>
<p>US would surely do the same towards any country that tried to apply sanctions on them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what kind of sanctions? US is (or at least can be) self sustaining on everything. Maybe not oil, but still better off than most 1st world countries (While cutting off all oil import to any European country would cripple it, except Norway, maybe the reverse would work there, as was done towards Iran)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that, according to the US government, we've never intentionally made a cobalt bomb (and won't). </p>
<p>Leo Szilard in part came up with the design to show the absurdity / futility of the arms race. </p>
<p>The cobalt bomb was never intended to be deployed. It would be insane to use one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
