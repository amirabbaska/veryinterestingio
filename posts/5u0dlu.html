		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this will get buried since I'm a little late, BUT
As a child conceived from sperm donation, you don't! There is a valid chance you will sleep with someone related to you. Due to the age of my donor, I'm much more worried about sleeping with a half sibling. I usually sit down with people I'm seeing and ask if there's any chance they were conceived from/a parent donated to a sperm bank.</p>
<p>Worst part is that there's always a chance <em>they</em> don't know. Sperm donation is a bit of a taboo subject still, so some parents never mention it.</p>
<p>I appreciate that my parents wanted children so badly, but it's still an ethical grey area for me. I enjoy being alive, but don't enjoy not knowing my father, not knowing half of my medical history, and wondering how many half siblings/cousins/relatives I have out there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, there isn't any mechanism to prevent this, but with how ridiculously unlikely it is to happen (and then even more unlikely you'd ever find out even if it did happen) I don't think it's something to be worth worrying about. </p>
<p>Sure it's creepy to think about but even in the extreme off chance this couple then actually settled down and had kids completely unaware of their relation, I don't think notable genetic issues arise after just one generation.</p>
<p>The sheer unlikeliness of any issue ever arising like this makes it not worth the effort trying to prevent imo. Maybe just don't sleep with people half your age who kinda look like you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;problem&quot; is not unique to sperm donation, fathers sometimes abandon their families/children (even before the child is born) and the child/father's identity would be unknown to the other. There's also anonymous sex, multiple partners, and other situations where the identity of the father is unknown or unrecorded.</p>
<p>So besides the small chance of this really being a problem, sperm donation doesn't necessarily create a large number of these situations compared to those that occur &quot;naturally&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
