		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes and no. Mostly no, though.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Depending on your choice of reference frame, you can make any collision look like something at rest is getting hit. For example, in your reference frame (which is in the 90 km/h car), you are at rest, so it's like being struck by a car only moving 30 km/h, at least as far as the immediate whiplash goes. </p>
<p>The big difference is that, relative to the ground, you have much greater <em>kinetic energies</em> since KE is determined by </p>
<pre><code>(Kinetic Energy) = 1/2 (Mass) (velocity)^2</code></pre>
<p>which grows quadratically with speed. Additionally, the wheels are spinning much faster, so there's more rotational kinetic energy there, but that's a small correction. </p>
<p>Basically, the reason the faster collision is more likely to be catastrophic is because the cars have more kinetic energy with respect to the ground, which is the thing they want to come to a rest with respect to. The instantaneous collision in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow" target="_blank">&quot;spherical cow in a vacuum&quot;</a> approach is the same, but the evolution of the collision in reality will depend heavily on the speeds. </p>
<p>Also, don't try this at home. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although the initial collision is very similar to a 30 kph collision, the aftermath could be quite different. The 0 v 30 crash ends with both cars going about 15 mph each, easily brought under control. The 90 v 120 case ends with both vehicles going about 105 and probably sliding sideways and out of control, an obviously much more dangerous situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. If the cars were moving in a vacuum in space, without spinning wheels, this would be precisely true. </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that about 25% of the kinetic energy of a car is rotational energy in the wheels. This rotational energy is irrespective of the relative motions of the vehicles. If the impact imparts a torque on any of the wheels that is not colinear with the axis of rotation of that wheel, the wheels will react as if the cars are moving at 90km/h and 120km/h and not at 30 and 0 km/h.
The effects of rotational inertia at these speeds is considerable.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that the vehicles are moving on a road, through the air. The car being rear-ended will tend to rock foward. If part of the chassis strikes the ground during the collision, it will tend to disrupt the orientation of the vehicle. If the orientation of the first vehicle is disturbed enough, it can result in a loss of control. Similarly the second vehicle can be disturbed. A loss of control at high speed is much more damaging than a simple collision at low speed with a stationary object. Another effect is that changes in the angle of attack with the air can further increase the instability and cause a further loss of control.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an oversimplification. But the point should be fairly made.</p>
<p>EDIT: reviewing the math, the rotational energy of the tires for a passenger sedan is ~5% of the linear KE, which at 120 km/h is still considerable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would use two spherical objects travelling in space  at 120 and 90 km/h. Assume there's no spin or tumble in either one and both have the same mass.  In this case,  yes... It would be like a collision at 30km/h with a motionless object. The car example is complicated and a lot of factors to consider that distract away from the intent of the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
