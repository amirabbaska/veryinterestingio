<p>This is incorrect. The number you produce is not necessarily a new prime. For example: 2*3*5*7*11*13+1=59*509. </p>
<p>Instead, any prime that divides this number cannot be any of the primes that you originally multiplied together. The way the proof then works is you take the first n primes p<em><em>1</em></em>,...,p<em><em>n</em></em>, multiply them together to get N=p<em><em>1</em></em>p<em><em>2</em></em>...p<em><em>n</em></em>. Because N+1 is a number bigger than 1, it follows that some prime p divides N+1. This prime cannot be any of the original primes p<em><em>1</em></em>,...,p<em><em>n</em></em>, because otherwise p would divide N and N+1, and so it would have to be the case that p divides 1, which can't happen. Therefore, any prime that divides N+1 is not on the original list of primes. Hence there are infinitely many primes.</p>
<p>If you could factor numbers efficiently, then you could use these numbers to find primes. But it is easier to find primes than it is to factor so this isn't a good route.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The infinite primes proof is a proof by contradiction - it assumes there are only finitely many primes. </p>
<p>If this is so, we can take the product of those n primes, and add 1. This new number has none of the n primes as a factor, so is either a new prime number, or is composite with new primes as a factors.</p>
<p>As in u/functor7 's example, notice we got a composite number, but new primes from that number.  </p>
<p>In our case, generating new primes this way does not work, because we already know there to be infinite primes. Thus taking the product any finite amount of them and adding 1 wont necessarily give us a new prime, and since determining if a number is prime is the entirety of the complexity, it is not a useful method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, and most important:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you multiply a bunch of primes and add one, you aren't guaranteed to get a prime, you're just guaranteed to get a number with a prime factor you didn't have before. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you only knew about the prime numbers 3 and 5, you couldn't deduce that 3x5+1 = 16 was prime. All you'd know was that if you could factorise 16, you'd find a new prime number, neither 3 nor 5. </p>
<p>Secondly, and much less important:</p>
<ul>
<li>even if in some strange universe you DID get a new prime by multiplying existing primes and adding 1, you'd only be able to find a few primes that way. Each new number would have <em>twice as many digits</em> as the previous record; even if you turned the whole earth into silicon wafers for memory chips, you wouldn't be able to write down more than about a hundred such numbers. </li>

<p>Finding new primes is not a problem. Computers are finding new primes constantly for cryptography applications. I don't know how many new primes are discovered daily, but it's got to be in the millions. And these newly discovered primes are used to generate RSA keys and then discarded, likely never to be seen again. There is no shortage of primes.</p>
<p>What you hear about are things like finding very very large primes, or primes of some special form (or usually both at the same time). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number" target="_blank">At this moment, the largest known prime is 2^74,207,281 - 1. This is a number with roughly 24 million digits.</a> This number is orders of magnitude of orders of magnitude larger than the primes with practical cryptographic applications, and the hunt for primes of this size requires more specialized techniques and technology than those which generate your every-day run-of-the-mill 100 digit primes. But I think a common misconception is that each time we discover a new largest known prime, that implies we know all the primes below it. It does not. If my math is right, the largest prime above should be around the 5*10^(22000000)th prime -- that is, the approximate number of primes below that prime is a 5 followed by 22 million zeros. This is orders of magnitude more primes than there are atoms in the universe. So we will never ever have a list of all the primes up to the largest known one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
