		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's boils down to the Constitution being the supreme law of the land. All legislation and Executive Orders need to follow the Constitution. And the Constitution gives responsibility to the courts to make sure this is happening (as a check on the other branches of government).</p>
<p>The reason may seem like random judges are doing this is because there is a hierarchy of Federal courts. Federal cases start at one of the 12 or so District courts that represent regions of the US. Those courts reach an initial decision, which is typically appealled and moves up the hierarchy until it reaches the Supreme Court. Most people aren't going to know who the judges in those lower level courts are, so it looks random. Also those courts are typically made up of many judges, and which one gets assigned a case will change. So it looks like a bunch of different names.</p>
<p>What those courts are usually doing when they &quot;block&quot; an Executive Order is basically putting the order on hold while they assess the legal arguments. The court has to weigh the damage that allowing an order to continue could do (if it were unconstitutional) versus the damage they could do by stepping in and interfering. That's what happened with the immigration ban, for instance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to balance the government's power the executive's word isn't law. Power is separated in three branches : legislature, executive and judiciary. It is supposed to balance out and create a state harder to control entirely. This, judges have the othority to ignore some directives in certain cases.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this system didn't anticipate the emergence of party-governed politic, where a large number of people elected will only refer to a single axe of policy. Right now, for example you have a single party controlling two branches of the US government. And the judges are the only counterbalance in play.</p>
<p>[Separation of power] is what you are looking for if you want to learn more on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not random, and it's not judges who are doing this on their own.  People are bringing cases before their courts challenging these executive orders etc.  It's not like one can bring a case directly to the supreme court, they would have to go through the lower courts first.  This can be done as there is a system of checks and balances where no one branch of the government (Executive, Legislative, Judicial) has complete authority over the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't &quot;random judges&quot; they are Federal District Court Judges who are charged with enforcing the laws of the United States with the Constitution being the highest law of all. </p>
<p>Executive Orders are not &quot;higher-level&quot; things. The Judicial Branch is a co-equal branch of government.  One of the main responsibilities of the Judicial Branch is to be a check on the power of the Executive Branch. If a Judge believes that an Order exceeds the Constitutional authority of the Executive Branch they have a duty under the law to declare that law invalid. </p>
<p>With a few rare exceptions the Supreme Court does not have what is called Original Jurisdiction. So if you feel an Executive Order is invalid you can't just start there. You have to work your way up from the District Courts, though the Circuit Courts, and Finally to the Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>The Executive can appeal, all the way to the Supreme Court, if they feel that the judge was mistaken. If that fails then they, though the Legislative Branch, can amend the Constitution. So there is a check on the Courts as well. That is how the system is designed. </p>
<p>No one, even a President, should be above the law.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution is given supremacy over every other law in the U.S., and when somebody sues in either Federal or State court they can raise both federal and/or state issues, including constitutional issues. In order to decide these cases, State judges and Federal judges both have the power to interpret and rule on laws up to the highest level of supremacy, such as the Constitution. Since the President’s powers are articulated in the U.S. Constitution, State and/or Federal courts may block Executive Orders issued by the President.</p>
<p><strong>Long Answer</strong></p>
<p>While the above is still true and valid law, the Supreme Court has recently hinted that they might be reconsidering this aspect of the law. Specifically, in <em>Trump v. Hawaii</em>, some of the justices remarked about the constitutionality of a Hawaii District Court dictating federal immigration policy via a court order. </p>
<p>Here's what the Roberts majority opinion said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to consider the propriety of the nationwide scope of the injunction issued by the District Court.&quot; <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Trump</em> at 39</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas' more explicit consideration is at <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf" target="_blank">page 2 of his dissent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The District Court imposed an injunction that barred the Government from enforcing the President’s Proclamation against anyone, not just the plaintiffs. Injunctions that prohibit the Executive Branch from applying a law or policy against anyone—often called “universal” or “nationwide” injunctions—have become increasingly common.1 District courts, including the one here, have begun imposing universal injunctions without considering their authority to grant such sweeping relief. These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system — preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch. </p>
<p><strong>I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions.</strong> These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding. And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts. If their popularity continues, this Court must address their legality.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas goes on for a number of pages with this issue, but the gist is that he's very doubtful that lower courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions.</p>
<p>However, in footnote 13 of her dissent, Sotomayor argues back on this issue. She says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Because the majority concludes that plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits, it takes no position on “the propriety of the nationwide scope of the injunction issued by the District Court.” Ante, at 39. <strong>The District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting nationwide relief.</strong> Given the nature of the Establishment Clause violation and the unique circumstances of this case, the imposition of a nationwide injunction was “ ‘necessary to provide complete relief to the
plaintiffs.’ ” Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 765 (1994); see Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979) (“[T]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class”).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, Sotomayor is correct from a legal standpoint. </p>
<p>That being said, I'd be willing to bet that this issue is raised in the next two or three terms with SCOTUS. And, given Kavanaugh's likely confirmation, it's a real possibility that such nationwide injunctions will be ruled unconstitutional. Kavanaugh is very similar to Gorsuch and Thomas, so it will be likely that Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito, and Thomas will rule against such nationwide injunctions. Roberts is a toss up. He doesn't like to overturn past decisions (the  <em>Janus</em> case being a rare exception) and he usually doesn't hold back with his opinions. So his hint here shouldn't be taken as anything super insightful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
