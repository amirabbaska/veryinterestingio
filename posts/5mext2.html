		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putting 24 hours in a day came from the ancient Egyptians who split the day into 2 parts. Daytime was 10 hours with an hour of twilight on either side and nighttime was 12 hours. Nighttime was 12 hours based on 36 stars called &quot;decans&quot; that the Egyptians used to keep track of time based on when they rose in the sky. 18 decans would be visible at any given time of the year, but 3 were assigned to each side of twilight, so there 12 leftover for nighttime hours.</p>
<p>The 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute comes from the ancient Babylonians who liked to split things in base 60. They had a thing for the number 360 because they thought that's how many days there were in year. They also like 60 because, like 12, it can easily be divided into several other whole numbers (2, 3, 4, 6). </p>
<p>The 7-day week came up independently in a few ancient societies. It's unclear why exactly, but most likely because it's 1/4 of the lunar cycle. It just so happens that about 52 weeks fit in a year.</p>
<p>People didn't start keeping track of years in their current form until significantly later on. The first person to start counting years from Jesus' birth was a Scythian monk named Dionysius Exiguus in 525 CE (and his system didn't become widespread until sometime later). Before that most people would count the number of years of the current king or other relevant ruler. So it would be something like the 10th year in the reign of King Virgo911. In Rome they would also sometimes count the number of years from the founding of the city. Most cultures around the world did this (counting years from a significant event or based on the ascension of a ruler or dynasty) and, in fact, that's what the current calendar does (counts years from a significant event, i.e. the birth of Jesus). We do it in base 10 because we're simply counting years from a reference point.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this is picking up some steam, more fun facts. The Romans used an 8 day week during the Republic. They switched over to a 7 day week during the Empire (and officially adopted it in 321 CE).</p>
<p>The Mayans had two different length weeks. One of 13 days where the days were just numbered and one of 20 days where the days were named. I'm not really sure how that works in practice.</p>
<p>The Jews had a 7 day week because of the creation story taking place over 7 days. It's unclear where 7 came from.</p>
<p>The French tried to implement decimal time shortly after the French Revolution, but it never caught on. In decimal time there are 10 hours in a day, 100 minutes in an hour, and 100 seconds in a minute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to emphasize that some of these divisions are physical; that is, that's just how they are.  The length of the day is fixed -- it's how long it takes for the Sun to move <em>all</em> the way around the Earth.  At noon on day 1, the Sun is at its highest point.  At noon on day 2, the Sun is again at its highest point.  The length of the day is the time between these two.  How we measure it is another matter.  Notice that I didn't say that it's the time that it takes for the Earth to spin around its axis.  That's because it actually takes less than a day to do that.  It's just that, by the time it has spun around, it's also moved a bit in its orbit, so the point that was directly facing the Sun is now a little bit behind.  Also, since the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the length of the day we use is really more of an average.</p>
<p>The other physical quantity we use today is the solar year.  That's how long it takes for the Earth to go all the way around the Sun.  The year is actually <em>not</em> exactly 365 days but a bit longer, which is why we add a day every four years or so (the rule for leap years is that we add one day whenever the year is a multiple of 4, unless it's a multiple of 100, in which case we add it only if it's a multiple of 400).  Nobody thought, hm, let's make the year 365 days.  365 (and a bit) is just how long it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun.</p>
<p>The 7-day week is just something that stuck with us from ancient cultures.  The ancient Israelites, for example, used a 7-day week, in which the 7th day was the day of rest.  In the Abrahamic traditions, that 7-day week was kept, though Christians and Muslims both changed the position of the day of rest within that week.  Other cultures had different weeks.  The Mayans, for example, had a 13-day week and a 20-day month, making a 260-day ritual year (that obviously didn't line up with the solar year; they used a different system for that).  It just so happened that the 7-day week is the one we use today, thanks in large part to the spread of Christianity, and the fact that there are 52 weeks in a year (plus a day, or two in leap years) is just coincidental.</p>
<p>Another physical quantity we use, but a lot less often, is the lunar month.  This is how long it takes for the Moon to make its way around the Earth, kinda.  Just like with the length of the day, the actual measure is how long it takes between new moon and new moon, when the relative position of the Sun, Earth, and Moon are the same.  This is some quantity between 29 and 30 days.  Many cultures use it, including the Jews, the Muslims, and the Chinese; the phases of the moon are a fairly reliable way to mark time.  Have you ever seen those moon calendars that tell you the phase of the moon on a given day?  These are completely unnecessary in lunar calendars -- you always know the phase of the moon because it's the same every month!  (The word &quot;month&quot; is even derived from &quot;Moon&quot; in English!)  At some point, the Christians moved to a solar calendar, and they got rid of the lunar months.  The thing we call a month now is kind of arbitrary.  The fact is that there are a few days less than 12 turns of the Moon around the Earth in one turn of the Earth around the Sun, so they split the solar year into 12 non-lunar months like we have today, each one with 30 or 31 days (I don't know why they made February have fewer), and they no longer line up with the Moon.  But the cultures that still use the lunar calendar have to work out ways to deal with the difference.  The Muslims simply don't.  Their year doesn't line up with the solar year at all and they're OK with that.  The Jews, on the other hand, insert a leap <em>month</em> 7 years out of every 19, and there are a few other months that get an added day in some cases, mostly in order to make various holidays not fall on various days of the week (the 21st day of the 7th month, Hoshana Rabah, isn't allowed to fall on Saturday, for example).  The main impetus here is to make sure that the 1st (Biblical) month is actually in the spring (note that long, long ago, Jews switched to a calendar that begins on the 7th month, which begins in the fall), so a month is added if the 12th month ends too early.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I should mention that the division sexagesimal (meaning 60) division of minutes and seconds isn't <em>actually</em> from the Babylonians.  Before decimals were invented by <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Napier.html" target="_blank">John Napier</a> in the late 1500's/early 1600's, people actually measured everything in fractions of 60.  This included degrees of a circle and parts of the hour.  So a time might be 4 hours and a bit.  How much was a bit?  26 60ths and a bit.  The first 60th subdivision was tiny so it was called a minute subdivision, and the second subdivision was called... well, they ran out of fucks to give so it was just the second subdivision.  So the time could be 4 hours, 26 minute subdivisions of an hour, and 5 second subdivisions of an hour.  Of course, you could also have third subdivisions of things and fourth subdivisions and so on, but there wasn't much reason to use them once decimals caught on.  On the other hand, hours kept their subdivisions because they were in common use by regular people, and degrees kept theirs because they were used in navigational star charts and such.</p>
<p>The only number I haven't explained here is the 24 hours in a day, but I think other people already have so I'll leave it at that!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>364/5 is defined by orbital mechanics.</p>
<p>The rest is courtesy of the Sumerian-Babylonian astronomers and mathematicians. Their commoners had rituals centered around the 7-day week but at the same time the mathematicians used a base-twelve arithmetic, creating favour for 5*12=60 minutes per hour.</p>
<p>Whereas the roots for &quot;decade&quot;, &quot;century&quot; and &quot;millennium&quot; all come from Latin, and Romans used baseless mathematics but favoured multiples of ten. &quot;Century&quot; for them basically meant &quot;a hundred dudes&quot;, such as a unit of hundred Legionnaires led by a Centurion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
