		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Academic psychiatrist here. First off, depression doesn't &quot;make&quot; people sad. Rather &quot;depression&quot; is a description of a person's experience. It is often used to describe the symptom of depression, but there are broader clinical entities such as a &quot;major depressive episode,&quot; which have operationalized definitions.</p>
<p>As for the question of constant euphoria, it certainly exists. Although it doesn't necessarily warrant clinical attention (people don't complain to me of &quot;wellbeing&quot;), people with extended periods of mood elevation often also experience periods of dark lows as well as too-high highs. The bipolar spectrum is not well characterized, but many researchers have dedicated their lives to exploring this. Periods of inappropriately elevated mood are described as hypomania (generally still functional) or mania (no longer functional). Without treatment, they can last for days to months at a time. However, some people tend to have a &quot;hyperthymic temperament&quot; or &quot;hyperthymic personality,&quot; by which we mean that their mood (-thymia) tends to be elevated (hyper) in a chronic fashion. Still others have chronically undulating moods over the course of years, which is described as cyclothymic disorder.</p>
<p>Should also add that &quot;mixed states&quot; exist where dysphoria and excessive energy co-occur. These are particularly dangerous and are associated with risk of suicide. The mood here tends to be profoundly irritable.</p>
<p>For an interesting read, here is a study that explored a broader definition of bipolar spectrum illness in the community: Fassassi S, Vandeleur C, Aubry JM, Castelao E, Preisig M. Prevalence and correlates of DSM-5 bipolar and related disorders and hyperthymic personality in the community. J Affect Disord. 2014 Oct;167:198-205. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Periods of chronic euphoria exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think the main reason it doesn't get a lot of press is that going to a doctor &amp; saying &quot;I've this terrible affliction, I can't stop being happy&quot; doesn't get much sympathy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
