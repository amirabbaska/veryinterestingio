		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.squawkfox.com/peanut-butter-recipes/" target="_blank">this web site</a>, it's much cheaper to make peanut butter at home than to buy it ready-made, which would go against your premise.</p>
<p>But then I found <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/make-or-buy-peanut-butter-153019" target="_blank">this site</a> which backs up your premise, and showing it costs a lot <em>more</em> to make peanut butter at home.</p>
<p>So why the discrepancy? The second link might shed some light on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I used all organic ingredients for the homemade version and was somewhat limited by what was available at Peapod. If you have access to bulk bins or un-shelled peanuts, you can likely bring the cost of the peanuts down by quite a bit...</p>
<p>I feel sure that more cost-effective sources of peanuts can be found at local markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like the answer is to buy un-shelled peanuts, in bulk. You're paying a premium when you buy peanuts because they've been shelled and packed into small packages. This a) pushes the cost of manufacture up, and perhaps more importantly b) means we are prepared to pay more for the convenience of having them this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You assume the peanuts that go into a jar of peanut butter are the same ones that go into a bag of peanuts. They're not. </p>
<p>The food that you buy whole (e.g. peanuts, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries) are the best of the crop. The food that you buy processed into some other form (e.g. peanut butter, tomato sauce, tater tots, strawberry jam) are the small or bruised or misshapen or damaged parts of the crop. The appearance or condition doesn't matter because it's not going to retain that form when processed anyway. </p>
<p>People will pay more for nicely formed, pretty produce. So the stuff you buy whole in the supermarket (or <em>lightly</em> processed, like a jar of roasted nuts) is more expensive than the produce that goes into highly processed foods (where highly processed = it doesn't retain any of it's original shape or form). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price of an item doesn't have to be directly tied to the cost to produce it; often times a business is more interested in the price customers are willing to pay for an item. If customers are willing to pay more for unprocessed peanuts than they are for the equivalent amount of peanut butter, then a company will gladly charge more for the peanuts even if they don't cost more to produce.</p>
<p>(An example of this came from a previous thread about child rates at movie theaters -- it costs the same to have a child in your theater as it does an adult, but they still charge less because families may not be willing to pay full price for all their children.)</p>
<p>There may be other issues such as peanut quality specific to peanut butter as well, but I don't want to speculate on those. I know more about pricing than I do about food processing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because they can use any peanut to make peanut butter, regardless of cosmetic flaws, or size. Actual peanuts, usually have some kind of quality control for the nicer looking peanuts, or size. It's a grading process. When they harvest peanuts, they determine based on size, and quality, what's what. I literally live in the middle of a peanut field in Virginia, and lease the property to peanut farmers to pay the personal property tax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually work for a peanut butter manufacturer and am a roaster supervisor. There are a lot of different kinds of peanuts and a major factor when making peanut butter is the aflatoxin levels in the peanuts. How you sort the peanuts is a major factor into what peanut lots you can use for the final product. There are many many more factors that go into it. The color of the roasted product, the viscosity, the quality as far as the aflatoxin specifications which differs based on if you are making an EU product or domestic. Shits complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
