		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both microwaves and wifi routers (except when using the newer connection types) transmit at a frequency of 2.4 GHz.</p>
<p>Normally, a microwave is shielded to prevent the radiation from leaking out. After all, the radiation is supposed to stay inside the oven to heat the contents, not to slip out into the room. However, old or damaged microwave ovens may not be perfectly shielded, allowing some radiation to leak out.</p>
<p>Now, microwaves operate at a far higher power level than wifi routers. Wifi routers aren't made to cook food, microwaves are, so far more power is needed. To compare, a microwave will use somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1 kW (1000 W), while a wifi router will be around 100 mW (0.1 W). So even a small leak in the shielding of a microwave can cause the leaked radiation to be as strong or stronger than what the router is transmitting.</p>
<p>And why does it kill your internet connection? Try talking with someone close to a running jet engine. Notice how that doesn't work too well? The same is true in the microwave/router case. The wifi devices pick up the radiation from the microwave and this noise is drowning out the signal from the router.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can compare the waves from the wi-fi and microwave to sound waves. </p>
<p>Microwaves are normally shielded in order to contain the waves inside but older or crappier units leak some of it.</p>
<p>Since the microwave oven is far more powerful than the wi-fi (it needs to be powerful enough to cook stuff) even that small leak can be enough to drown out the wi-fi signal. Think about trying to talk to someone at a loud concert - the music will drown out your voice making it very difficult to be heard. Same thing happens with wi-fi</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hint: if you want to avoid this interference, get a modern Wi-fi router, that supports both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. The 5GHz bands have much less interference, but also don't penetrate walls and other obstacles as well, so they have a lower range.  Still, should be enough for typical household use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer here.</p>
<p>The cavity magnetron of of microwave oven is used to generate microwaves, however it generates pretty random signals when its powering up, and many magnetrons are designed to run on the purely positive or negative portions of a residential electrical service, so it powers up 60 times a second. </p>
<p>The wavelength of most microwaves generated is 12.5 cm (Î»), and as the magnetron powers up repeatedly at 60HZ, it can generate radio signals that have both AM and FM characteristics around the 2.4 GHz range. A properly shielded magnetron cavity shouldn't cause any interference, however a cheaply made or damaged one could spew out noisy sinewaves.</p>
<p>Its important to note that the microwaves do not play a role in interference at all, but the process of generating them can create these spurious signals.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
