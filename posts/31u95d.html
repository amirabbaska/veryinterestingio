It seems to be that a transgender person can simply say &quot;This is how I feel, how I have always felt.&quot; Yet there is scientific evidence that they are in fact their original gender...eg genitalia, sex hormones etc etc.</p>
<p>If someone suffers from hallucinations for example, doctors say that the hallucinations are not real. The person suffering hallucinations is considered to have a mental illness because they are experiencing something (hallucinations) despite evidence to the contrary (reality).
Is a transgender person experiencing a condition where they perceive themselves as the opposite gender DESPITE all evidence to the contrary and no scientific evidence? </p>
<p>This is a genuine question</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a very legitimate question.  Conditions of the brain and mind have long held a stigma in human culture of being separate and apart from conditions of other parts of the body.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that being &quot;transgender&quot; is a mental illness, nor am I saying that it is not a mental illness.  I am saying that most people perceive the brain as being exempt from the rules of the rest of the human body and human society.</p>
<p>I have a brother with a serious mental illness, and an acquaintance of the family blurted out one day, &quot;He just needs to get his head straight.&quot;  Well... I lost it.  I blurted out, &quot;And your Dad... The one who has the Pancreatic Cancer?  He just needs to miracle his Pancreas into total remission, too... Doesn't He?!&quot;</p>
<p>Not very tactful of me, I know.  But, the point is made...</p>
<p>How much do we really know about the human brain?</p>
<p>Why are &quot;mental illnesses&quot; considered to be curable by sheer willpower alone?</p>
<p>Why is a transgender person considered to be mentally ill?  Perhaps a transgender person is not ill in any way whatsoever.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ITT: Lots of Tumblr, apparently.</p>
<p>Transgender person here, and your question is a good one (or at least, a common one that really isn't answered clearly very often)</p>
<p>The short answer is: yes, Trans people are considered to have a disorder. Gender Dysphoria is a disorder recognized in the DSM.</p>
<p>There have been a few studies establishing certain evidence to support the idea that this is inherent (a few having to do with brain mapping/MRIs pop up now and again) but the funding and interest for serious, driven research into the field just hasn't been there until recently. A lot of existing studies are either too old to be taken seriously or flawed due to lack of funding or existing bias. The best guess right now is that the brain is just wired to expect a different set of physical characteristics than it has, and thus causes dysphoria as a way of expressing that it thinks there is something wrong with ones body.</p>
<p>Your question seems to be more &quot;Why don't we get these transgender people mental help instead of physical modifications to their body&quot; and the answer is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Trans people already have to have years of therapy from multiple doctors and therapists to get the required letters of recommendation (verification that therapists and doctors have confidence that the person does experience Gender Dysphoria and that they believe that sexual transition would be beneficial to the patient's mental health) needed to get hormones and SRS (sexual reassignment surgery) and no form of conversion therapy has worked anywhere near consistently.</p>
</li>
<li>It is just easier (at this point in time, at least) to modify the body to reduce dysphoria than it is to modify the brain to stop dysphoria altogether.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as what I can describe to you from personal experience, I am not in denial about the fact that I have a penis and that I grow facial hair and that my body produces testosterone. I can tell you that the physical presence of these things causes constant distress, feelings of depression and self hate, the whole nine yards. When I wear female clothes, ask you to call me by a different name or use different pronouns, wear makeup, etc., it is more to fool my unconscious self and distract it from the fact that certain parts of my body just feel <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Plenty of other similar conditions, like Body Dysmorphic Disorder, have long been recognized and accepted by the medical community. Sometimes the brain expects your body to be different than it is.</p>
<p>It's like if you were to take the hard drive out of one computer and into a different computer. You'll probably be able to boot and do most things, but you'll occasionally get some errors because that hard drive and the Operating System inside has been set up to expect a certain hardware configuration in the computer, and has problems when what hardware it thinks you have differs from the hardware you actually hook up to it. We (the medical community) don't know how to reprogram the computer yet, so switching out hardware is the next easiest thing.</p>
<p>Trust me, if there was a pill that got rid of my dysphoria so that I felt content with my male sex characteristics, I would imagine that would be far easier and pain free to take than years of hormone therapy and multiple, very expensive surgeries. Such a thing doesn't exist yet, so I only have one other choice.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should mention that my experiences doesn't cover every one you hear. There has been a push in certain groups to remove gender dysphoria from being the identifying factor of being transgender, and make it solely an &quot;identity&quot;. I personally take issue with this (as it removes all scientific aspects from the issue), but many trans people support the idea or just don't care. It's the internet, and Reddit is a great trolling ground when the Tumblr bloggers want to stir up trouble. You are likely to hear lots of different opinions.</p>
<p><del>EDIT 2: By popular request, AMA is up <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31vosf/iama_former_mormon_ftm_trans_women_ama/" target="_blank">HERE!</a></del></p>

<p>EDIT 4: Replies are finally dying down, I just want to say that the maturity and genuine openness expressed here really is something to be proud of. Today was a really great experience for me. Thanks!</p>
<p>EDIT 5: If I didn't answer your question, Reddit didn't give me a notification. I'll look through one last time for ones that I missed!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! I'm a neurologist, and a transgender one at that. Here's something that I wrote two months ago in response to a conversation with someone who was asking this exact question:</p>
<hr />
<p>It's unreasonable to call being transgender any kind of mental health disorder, and whilst the DSM <em>does</em> list &quot;gender identity disorder&quot; in the fourth edition, it does NOT do so in the fifth and latest. It has been replaced with &quot;gender dysphoria&quot;, which more accurately represents what the issue is - the pain of dysphoria, rather than the identity itself being the issue. </p>
<p>Being trans is a product of who we are as a species, possessed of both brains that can be miswired in relation to our bodies, <em>and</em> of sufficient self-awareness to recognise that fact. Given also that it often causes trans people extreme pain and distress, with the result that the transgender suicide rate <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank">is higher than almost any other group</a>, with more 1 in 2 transgender people having made an active attempt to take their own lives in some cases, transition is often not just a necessity, but life-saving. </p>
<p>In addition, can we consider the tragic deaths of those who have willingly or (far more concerningly) unwillingly undergone transgender &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, most recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leelah_Alcorn" target="_blank">the highly publicised suicide of Leelah Alcorn</a>? These &quot;therapies&quot; have never, ever been shown to be successful, and cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy" target="_blank">extreme trauma and sometimes physical harm</a> to those who are subjected to them. In many cases, those who undergo these procedures often commit suicide afterwards. Surely this shows that attempts to cure LGBT people, of any orientation, of their neurologically hard-wired conditions is dangerous and sadistic, not to mention of extremely dubious legality when there's an unconsenting minor involved.</p>
<p>Let's also consider the actual definitions of both <em>disease</em> and <em>disorder</em>.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><strong>Disease;</strong> noun, - <em>a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.</em></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><strong>Disorder;</strong> noun, - <em>a state of confusion</em>  </li>
<li><strong>Disorder;</strong> verb, - <em>to negatively disrupt the systematic functioning or neat arrangement of</em></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>So, a &quot;mental health disorder&quot; is a psychiatric condition that causes a disruption in the functioning of the mind, to the detriment of the mind itself. This detriment is due directly to the impact of the symptoms of the condition itself, and is not due to the social, economic or similar impacts of having such a condition. </p>
<p>Being a neurological condition, being transgender is not something that is based in the mind anyway. Being transgender is due to the fundamental architecture of the brain being in a specific way, rather than due to an alteration in the functioning of either the mind or the brain. The latter is known as a psychiatric condition; examples include OCPD (obsessive-compulsive personality disorder) and NPD (narcissistic personality disorder).</p>
<p>Being transgender does not, in and of itself, cause harm to the body. Almost all of the harmful aspects of being transgender are not, in fact, the result of the fact itself; instead, they are the results of having to <em>be</em> transgender in a world that is largely against the concept, and therefore society impresses on us all that transgender people are neither wanted nor accepted. Now, I won't lie, being transgender is very distressing to the mind, because the brain has found itself in a body that does not suit it. Certainly this is negatively impacting. However, being a neurologist and having seen these things in real disorders, I do not agree that it causes &quot;disruption in systemic functioning&quot;. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It does not alter how the brain processes thoughts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does not negatively harm the brain's ability to learn or grow</p>
</li>
<li>It does not directly (<em>read, as a result of the condition</em>) harm the mind. </li>
</ol>
<p>At least one of those things is required for a condition to be considered a disorder. None of the criteria are met, and so at most it could be considered a non-pathological neurological condition, and put down to the natural variety and diversity of the human condition.</p>
<hr />
<h2>In conclusion:</h2>
<p>Being transgender is a natural part of the human experience. Sometimes people are male, and sometimes they're female. Most often, what genitals people aligns with what gender identity they align to, but sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a person's gender identity is fluid, or non-binary, or they don't identify with a gender at all. <em>This is all totally fine</em>.  </p>
<p>Being transgender can be proven, through neurological and physiological analysis, to be something that is an inherent part of those who identify with it. It's not something that needs to be cured, or needs to be changed. It's just something that needs to be accepted. The very, very best thing you could do for a transgender person would be to <em>treat them like a person</em>. Treat trans males and females and everyone else as regular humans. Other than support for things like getting hormone replacement therapy, or maybe teaching your new bros or girlfriends about the mysterious ways of their identified genders, trans people just want to be treated like human beings. If we stop making an issue out of it, it will stop being an issue (if you see what I mean).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clinical psychology graduate student here.  There's an important idea that has been left out of all of the top comments regarding criteria for any mental disorder.  Just because something is not normal or out of the set of usual characteristics we see in people does not make it a disorder.  In order to be a true mental disorder, it must satisfy at least one of three criteria: it must cause distress to the person; it must interfere with that person's ability to function; or it must increase the risk of harm to the person or others.  Furthermore, it must not be something that is culturally accepted.  </p>
<p>You bring up hallucinations as an example, and say that we label people with hallucinations as having mental disorders because they believe false things.  However, there are plenty of examples of false things that people can believe without being considered disordered.  For instance, optical illusions cause people to believe things are a certain way when they are not.  These cause no harm or distress, so they are not considered disorders.  Similarly, people can believe all sorts of strange religious ideas with no proof, but because these are typically sanctioned by the culture they exist in, they are not considered mental disorders.  </p>
<p>What makes hallucinations part of a mental disorder is that the people who have them are often disturbed by them, and they can cause people to do harm to themselves and others.  It's the same way with gender dysphoria.  If a person believes that they are of a different gender than their biological one, but is totally fine with the situation, they do not have a disorder.  It's the suffering due to the difference where the disorder comes into play.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
