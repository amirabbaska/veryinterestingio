		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the problems that led to the development of quantum theory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment" target="_blank">gold foil experiment</a> showed that an atom's positive charges are concentrated in a small region (the nucleus) and its negative charges are spread around it in a much larger volume. It was immediately apparent that according to the classical laws of mechanics and electrodynamics, an atom's electrons should very quickly spiral into its nucleus. Obviously, these theories could not be used to understand the internal behavior of atoms.</p>
<p>The solution to this conundrum was found in a reformulation of Hamiltonian mechanics. Hamiltonian mechanics uses the relationship between an object's energy and momentum to derive its motion through its environment. By combining this with the observation that atomic systems can only exist in discrete energy states (ie, 1 or 2 but not between them), it was discovered that the momentum states must also be discrete. In particular, the electrons' momentum is constrained in such a way that there is no pathway for them to travel into the nucleus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well they do in fact collide and glue together sometimes. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture" target="_blank">reverse beta decay</a>, which causes a proton to become a neutron.</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that neutrons are heavier than the mass of a proton and electron combined, and so require even more energy to create than was available from the incoming electron. It also means that when there are too many neutrons in the nucleus, there is enough surplus energy to cause the nucleus to decay by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay" target="_blank">alpha</a> or beta emission and fire out particles that sort out the imbalance.</p>
<p>Another simple explanation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model" target="_blank">bohr model</a> of the atom, which assumes that an electron is a simple wave (pre schrodinger) and it needs to form whole wavelengths that are proportional to its momentum. If it fell into the atom, its wavelength would get longer, but there would not be enough space to contain a whole cycle of the wave, making it an impossible position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons don't actually orbit the nucleus. They exist in complicated probability distributions called orbitals. These tell you where an electron is likely to be found. You can find the shapes of these for an atom by finding a wave function that will solve the schroedinger equation. If you look at atomic orbitals you'll notice that the probability of the electron being in the nucleus is essentially zero. </p>
<p>There is one instance though where electrons will enter the nucleus. This is a type of radioactive decay called electron capture. The nucleus of an atom captures an electron from the innermost s orbital and this combines with a proton to make a neutron and neutrino.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of hand-waving explanations that don't really address &quot;why,&quot; they just kind of re-state that it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>I think the short answer has two parts:</p>
<p>First, they don't &quot;orbit&quot; the nucleus. Electrons exist around the nucleus in a wavefunction. You have to completely throw out the concept of particles travelling in well defined paths when you start thinking about electrons inside of atoms and molecules, otherwise none of it will ever make sense.</p>
<p>Second, no one knows &quot;why&quot; it is this way. All of the math and theory behind quantum mechanics is <em>descriptive</em> - we are describing what is happening in as precise of mathematical terms as we can. We can give more details, and say things like &quot;we know electrons can't be acting like classical particles because of this,&quot; or &quot;wave mechanics describes what we observe,&quot; but this isn't an answer to &quot;why,&quot; at least not in the sense that I am assuming you meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Why&quot; in science is really just moving down into a new layer of detail. If you ask why electrons don't fall into the nucleus, the next layer of detail is: &quot;Because they aren't classical particles. They aren't particles at all, and instead should be thought of as probability densities of charge.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physicists wondering at this very question is one thing that led to the development of quantum mechanics. When you look at the quantum mechanical description of an atom, you can see why electrons won't spiral into the nucleus.</p>
<p>You never really 'understand' quantum mechanics the way you do classical physics. You can get a good feel for the math, and for what you should expect to get given some physical system, but it's different from the way you intuit something like colliding billiard balls or (classical) gravity</p>
<p>When I learned quantum mechanics I came to understand the word 'understand' differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
