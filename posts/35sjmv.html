		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin provides an osmotic barrier, keeping the concentration of fluids in your body at homeostatic levels. You're not going to absorb water through the skin and even if you were able to, it wouldn't rehydrate you.</p>
<p>Additionally, the effects of water pressure and submersion during the onset of dehydration would <a href="http://www.klemmerhead.com/vitalyte/hydration-101/science-articles/hypothermia-and-dehydration/" target="_blank">contribute to hypothermia</a> and bodily wear (i.e. trenchfoot) which would take their toll over time anyways, over that of the person who remains on land. After a time, prolonged exposure to moisture would also cause the bonds between epithelial cells in the skin to weaken leading to maceration of the epidermis which would eventually leave the person open to infection as well. One notable example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blaine#cite_note-40" target="_blank">David Blaine stunt</a> in which he was submerged in an isotonic solution for 7 days and emerged with skin breakdown on the hands and feet. Humans aren't designed to survive indefinitely in water. </p>
<p>Assuming other factors are held constant, the submerged person would consume more energy and water due to the body needing to adapt to indefinite submersion and thus dehydrate sooner.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>The 'tub' is implied to be more like a pool/large tank as the test subject is submerged up to the neck, thus pressure is assumed to be a factor. </p>
<p>Also the notion that one can 'drink' through the anus has been brought up repeatedly. While it's true that a person can bypass the digestive tract and rehydrate this way, barring an enema, it's not physically possible for the average human being to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like visuals, so here are some. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomas-/17070402826/in/datetaken-public/" target="_blank">This</a> is human skin. You can see the outer edge is all thin layers. The round cyan blobs underneath are cell nuclei. Those cells in your epidermis are all constantly being renewed, and they head out to the outer edge and as they go they lose their nuclei and turn into little balls of fat. They also secrete some proteins that 'tie' each cell to it's neighnbour. This creates an 'Epidermal barrier', which stops water going out of your body, and also obviously stops water coming in. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomas-/16971478384/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a picture of an epidermal barrier function being 'tested', something (purple) has been injected into the dermis, and this substance is trying to get out from the skin, but you can see that the epidermal barrier (blue) stops it. </p>
<p>If you lay in a bath tub the water is just soaking into the very very top flattened layer of your skin (the out part of picture 1), and that part of your skin is just the thin, flattened keratinised chitinous skin flakes that are your 'wear and tear' armour. The water doesn't get past your epidermal barrier and can't help you. </p>
<p>Having said that, you can drink water, and if you don't swallow it you can still absorb it readily in your mouth. The same lack of epidermal barrier function in your mouth is also in your ass, so you can just try and suck some water up your <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">ass</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While skin is fairly waterproof, there are some fairly accessible mucous membranes which could do a decent job. If you pried your anus open or inserted a cloth up there while pulling your foreskin back to expose the head of your penis (or insert a cloth into your vulva if you're a woman) you might be able to absorb a significant amount of water over time through these membranes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should also consider effect of temperature. At the same temperature, water will transfer heat much much more rapidly. If too cold, water will hasten you freezing to death. If too warm, water will hasten your death by dehydration.</p>
<p>If the ambient air is very warm but the body of water is pleasantly cool, being submerged would be protective as you would not have sweat as much to stay cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Why, when I pee, I feel like I have totally relaxed my urethral sphincter and my bladder is totally empty, do I sometimes feel a strong need to pee 5 minutes later. Does this happen to everybody, or just old people?</p>
