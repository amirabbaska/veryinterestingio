I grow daffodils in my kitchen which is a pretty consistent temperature all year round however, without fail my daffodils will bloom in the spring and die back over winter. How do they know when to do this? </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for their responses. I understand how it works now.</p></div></div>

Temperature varies every day and swings over a large range.  It's not as reliable as sunlight.  Some plants, like cherry trees, do use ground temperature, but they bloom very early in the spring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually by the amount of light/darkness they get. Many plants are either &quot;short-day&quot; plants or &quot;long-day&quot; plants. </p>
<p>&quot;Short day&quot; plants are actually more accurately &quot;long night&quot; plants, in that they require more than a certain number of hours <em>without</em> light in order to get the signals to enter their reproductive life cycle. They've tested this by putting these plants in an isolated environment and turning on and off the lights at specific times. If you leave a &quot;short day&quot; plant in darkness for 13 hours but turn the light on for ten minutes in the middle of those 13 hours, it still won't bloom! This is because its internal clock resets when it gets hit with that light.</p>
<p>&quot;Long day&quot; (short night) plants are exactly the opposite. They will start blooming only when they're exposed to less than 12 hours of darkness at a time.</p>
<p>The way this actually works is that plants have special enzymes called phytochromes that exist in two different molecular forms based on whether they're exposed to, essentially, brightness or dim light/darkness. Short day plants need a lot of the &quot;dark&quot; form of the enzyme to activate the genes necessary for flowering, so they can only bloom when longer nights allow the &quot;dark&quot; form to build up to high enough levels. Vice versa for the long day plants.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer for most houseplants, but those of us over at /r/microgrowery know. Different light cycles and temperatures tell plants the seasons. With cannabis, the plant has two phases; Vegetative and Flowering. Vegetative is typically the early summer, and Flower is usually fall. Indoors, you can keep plants in Veg virtually indefinitely. This is because in the earlier part of the summer, the plant receives 14 hours of sunlight per day, and we can mimic that through artificial lights (Some like a 18/6 cycle, some like 24 hours of light per day). The plant has no reason to flower because it &quot;thinks&quot; it's early summer, so it just grows structurally and not at all for reproduction. Warmer temperatures also help for the same reason. </p>
<p>Once the plant begins getting less than 14 hours of light per day and slightly cooler temperatures, it &quot;knows&quot; that it's getting later in the year and begins to move to the Flower phase. Indoors, we just shorten the light cycle to 12/12 and drop the temperature a tiny bit to mimic the changing seasons. The plant begins creating pollen sacs or flowers to reproduce. Cannabis is a wind-pollinated plant, meaning that they do not rely on bees or other insects to spread their pollen, rather they &quot;pop&quot; pollen into the air and hope it spreads to a female plant. If a healthy female plant is pollinated, it will stop growing and focus on seeds, because it &quot;knows&quot; that the year has ended along with its own life cycle. When growing for product, the females are isolated and when they move into flower, the flowers get bigger and stickier and more proudly displayed because the plant &quot;knows&quot; that it needs to get pollinated before winter sets in.</p>
<p>Plants never really &quot;know&quot; the seasons, but they react to them and rely on them to direct their own life cycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daylight length and daylight quality. In the full blown summer the days are long and the light is more in the blue spectrum, as summer is ending the daylight is shorter and more into the red spectrum.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why you need blueish lights for growth (metal halide), and reddish light (high pressure sodium) for growing... ahem.... your tomatoes indoors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
