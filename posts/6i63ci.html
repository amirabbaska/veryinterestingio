		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I know they aren't exactly selling your information, they're making more readily available what's called 'Publically Identifiable Information'.</p>
<p>This kind of information is technically accessible to basically anyone, but truly should only be identifiable by the individual- such as old phone numbers, vehicles owned, old addresses, relatives, etc. Most of those are identifiable by Google, social media, Whitepages, even deep digs into the internet but there are so few people out there trying to actively seek 100% of all of that information fraudulently. But where LexisNexis comes into play is more of the in-the-moment quizzes that companies are utilizing. You can only err once during these questions, and the odds that someone fraudulent could correctly guess all of the 3-5 questions about you is very, very slim</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former LN employee here. The information that you are able to get by filling out the paperwork to request your own report can only be obtained by insurance companies and potential employers which have been &quot;credentialed&quot; and obtained your written consent.  The credential process includes having a valid business license on file with LN and also having a site visit to ensure that the business is legit and understands data security. They must have a locking file cabinet for personally identifiable information, for example.</p>
<p>Any information that is sold or available to the public is already public record.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you signed your employment application (or whatever had this form), one of the forms was a &quot;Consent to background search&quot;.  In that form you agree to let Lexis verify all of the data they have, what data you've given them, and then share this with your employer (or whomever you signed the form for).</p>
<p>For people looking up info on people in Lexis itself, they either only have access to publically available records (addresses, death records, criminal records... these are all public info) but anything more in depth requires special authorization.  Private Investigators can get this authorization as I recall.  As well as others that are deemed to not abuse the information and have a reasonable need for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to use LexisNexis, or other similar services, you must be verified.  Typically a representative will verify information provided and then do a site visit to ensure compliance.
Each time I use the service I must answer questions relating to my purpose under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
These services are necessary, especially for debt collection and court proceedings.  Users are required, and agree, to keep information confidential.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This implies that the other people getting data from LexisNexis don't also fill out lengthy paperwork to prove who they are...  Which is not the case. LexisNexis certainly has an interest in only sharing their data with legitimate (and well paying) customers.  And the data is all stuff you consented to sharing or, in other avenues, aren't actually in control of (data gathered about you by someone else isn't yours at all).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
