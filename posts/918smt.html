		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: The faster you move, the closer you need to get to the celestial body you want to slingshot around. At some point, you burn up in the atmosphere, crash into the surface or get ripped apart by gravitational force differences.</p>
<p>When you do a gravitational slingshot, you're essentially &quot;bouncing&quot; on the planet, doing a 180 degree turn around the celestial body. From the celestial body's point of view, you approach it at the same speed and once the slingshot is complete you leave with the same speed. In other words, we can simply see it as a bounce with a restition coefficient of 1 (no energy lost) on the celestial body.</p>
<p>The key to a successful gravitational slingshot is to have the celestial body approach towards you. Let's say you have a planet hurtling towards you at 10km/sec, while you fly towards it at 2km/sec. From the planet's perspective, you are approaching the planet at 10+2=12km/sec, you'll loop around the planet and then go back in the direction you came from at 12km/sec. However, from our perspective, we approach the planet at 2km/sec, get flung around it and then fly away in the same direction as the planet at 22km/sec (very confused about the exact speed).</p>
<p>In essence, you're stealing some of the kinetic energy of the celestial body you slingshot around, and the effectiveness of this is solely dependent on how fast the celestial body is moving, so there's no theoretical maximum speed apart from the speed of light (which you can always keep getting closer and closer to as your kinetic energy increases).</p>
<p>However, there are practical problems that will either reduce the efficiency and practicality of a slingshot, or even make it downright impossible. The faster you go, the stronger gravity needs to be to be able to sling you around the celestial body. The only way to increase the force of gravity from the body is to get closer to it. This means that you get quite a few problems. If you're trying to sling around a planet or moon, you could start experiencing drag from the atmosphere, which would not only slow you down a lot but also potentially burn you up. If the planet/moon has a solid surface, you may not even be able to get close enough to the planet without crashing into it. Similarly, getting too close to a star has some obvious drawbacks.</p>
<p>A black hole is therefore optimal for a slingshot operation as it is neither warm nor has any significant atmosphere nor surface. You can always get a little bit closer to the event horizon to allow you to turn around it quicker, although at some point you'll get so close to the black hole that your ship is torn apart due to the different parts of the ship experiencing so different gravitational forces (the parts closest to the hole turns inwards, while the farthest parts don't turn enough to keep up with the center of the ship).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acceleration from a gravitational slingshot is limited by a few factors: how fast is the assisting body moving, how strong is its gravity, and how close can you get without impacting its surface/burning up in its atmosphere? For an optimum gravitational slingshot, you want to use a very massive body with a small radius in an extremely fast orbit. Your best bet would be to find a binary system of two neutron stars or black holes orbiting one another at relativistic speeds. Under the right circumstances, your spacecraft could easily accelerate to a significant fraction of the speed of light. </p>
<p>It's also unnecessary to use an unmanned spaceship for this trip. The human body is only damaged when different body parts experience different amounts of acceleration. Since the gravitational field of most astronomical bodies is practically uniform on the length scale of the human body, there is no risk of bodily harm. A passenger on the slingshot voyage would feel like they were in free fall, just like a person orbiting the Earth or floating through interstellar space. </p>
<p>The exception to this would be if you experience significant tidal forces. For example, if you get really close to a black hole, the strength of the gravitational field experienced by your feet will be greater than that experienced by your head (or vice versa depending on your orientation), and you run the risk of death by spaghettification. However, for this gravitational slingshot experiment, you could always just use a more massive black hole (which has a more uniform gravitational field) to avoid this risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will find this very interesting. This isn't completely relevant but there are ways to use what you would think of as a &quot;Gravity Slingshot&quot; to get far faster then other comments have suggested as the max.  Alot of comments did the math of falling into a black hole and swinging around at a 1% c if you have a long run up. But there is a MUCH more devilish way to use a black hole to go extreamly fast. Black holes spin horrendously fast and have a enormous mass. If a ship was to grab hold of a asteroid far larger then itself and fly into the maelstrom of a black holes disk, it will speed up and spin with the black hole up as it moves farther in. As the Ship+Asteroid gets close to the point of no return it reaches the Ergo Zone. At this point the ship drops the asteroid into the event horizon, and the kinetic energy of the two masses all goes to the ship which is blasted out going multiple times faster then it was only a second before. And I'm talking .2c easy. I looked it up, and if you were to use a moon as you sacrifice for a small ship you could reach .8 or .9c. Ya, no lie, no joke. Here's a nice video explaining the concept.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on the star.
Sling shot, if I remember correctly is the act of being dragged by a planetary body, alllowing the starship to &quot;steal&quot; momentum from that, and accelerating.
So if you do that on a neutron star or a black hole, orbitig another one you can actually gain significant speed, giving you don't get spaghettized by the magnetic field,  gravity and you actually have enough escape velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you enter a planet's sphere of influence you will leave at the same velocity relative to the planet.</p>
<p>So if you are cruising along at N meters per second relative to the Sun, you will find yourself traveling some different value of N when you reach the sphere of influence.</p>
<p>This can be a lot faster, if the planet is coming toward you, or a lot slower, if it is going away from you.</p>
<p>So if the planet was coming straight for you, you're faster relative to it than you were relative to the Sun and you can end up going right back the way you came, at that velocity.</p>
<p>The result is a net addition of twice the planet's velocity relative to the Sun. You can get less out of this at other angles, or you can lose velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
