		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are really 5 years old: </p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine three people on a row boat. </li>
<li>Single-phase power: One guy is rowing, and each stroke takes three seconds. Stroke - 2 - 3. Stroke - 2 - 3. It's enough to move the boat. It's enough to power virtually any modern equipment -- whose power supply takes those strokes and converts it into useful energy.</li>
<li>Three-phase power: All three guys are rowing. Each person's stroke takes three seconds. But they each stroke exactly 1/3 after the last dude goes. So essentially, you are never more than a third of a stroke off the some guy's strongest.</li>
</ul>
<p>This explanation is not a literally 100% precise analogy, but it's reasonably good enough. One complication is that:</p>
<p>(a) in the United States, where 3-phase power is commonly &quot;line-to-line&quot;, the power of a 3-phase system (at a certain amperage) is not literally 3x the power of a single-phase system (at the same amperage). For reasons beyond the understanding of a 5-year-old, it is 1.732 times greater.</p>
<p>(b) in Europe, where 3-phase power is commonly &quot;line-to-neutral&quot;, it's a better analogy.</p>
<p>But whatever, you are five.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both are forms of alternating current (AC)</p>
<p>Alternating current cycles from +120V to -120V, 60 times per second (assuming you live somewhere that uses 120V 60 Hz for mains power)</p>
<p>Single phase power means that all of the power in the wire alternates from +120V to -120V. </p>
<p>Three phase power has three wires, all alternating from +120 to -120, all at the same frequency, but they are offset from each other. Basically, when Phase 1 is at its peak, Phase 2 is in the middle, and Phase 3 is at the bottom. So in 3 phase, there's virtually always a wire at 120V or very close to it. It delivers a steady stream of power, and that makes it much more useful for higher electrical loads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From someone who has worked 30 plus years in industrial environments.  Surprised that everyone in this thread is stating 120 volt 3 phase as if that's even a thing.  Most 3 phase power in the U.S. is 480 VAC 3 phase. That's what most industry uses for powering moterized equipment.  240 volt 3 phase is also used but less common.  I have never heard of 120 volt 3 phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are holding a pole, and someone else has the other end. The other guy pushes you with the pole, then pulls, then pushes, then pulls, etc. etc.  Really fast.  You never go anywhere, but you get pushed back and forth. That's single phase power.  </p>
<p>Now imagine that there are 3 poles, attached to your belt at 120 degree spacing.  Pole A pushes you, and then when they are pulling on you Pole B pushes you, and when Pole B is pulling on you Pole C pushes you.  All of them push and pull you constantly, but out of synch.  You never go anywhere, but you get pushed/pulled a lot. This is 3 phase power. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is basically 3 lines of same voltage that are 1/3 out of phase with each other.  AC is push/pull on the electrons created by (in traditional rotary style generators) magnets moving past a coil.  The + side of magnets pulls the electrons, then the - side comes in a pushes the electrons, and this goes back and forth creating an alternating current in the form of  sin wave.  Now, within this generator the coils/magnets are arranged in such a way that as one coil's electrons are pushed another's is pulled and yet another is right in the middle, each of which is it's own phase.  These 3 lines leave the powerhouse at super high voltages, 500KV+ and are distributed to the &quot;grid&quot;.  They run to sub stations that take in these high voltages and convert them down to say 10KV.  These mid level lines are then distributed to points of use where there is another transformer that converts it down to 110V.   Now, most homes and small businesses only need 1 phase, so the transformer for that location only pulls off of 1 of the 3 lines.  Converts it to 110V and sends it into the building.  However, big industry that uses big electrical motors and such will actually have all 3 phases come in and those 3 phases are fed to the motor.   A 3 phase motor is much more efficient, creates less heat and can generate more power.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
