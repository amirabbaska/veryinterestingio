		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is an electromagnetic wave, which consists of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. All waves are governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation" target="_blank">wave equation</a>, and an important property of solutions to wave equations is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference" target="_blank">interference</a> (if you add one wave to another, you get an effective wave which also satisfies the wave equation).</p>
<p>When light travels through a medium, the electric field induces oscillations in the neighboring electrons. These oscillations create electromagnetic waves of their own, which interfere with the original wave to create an effective wave with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity" target="_blank">group velocity</a> lower than the original vacuum EM wave. (If you're curious to know more, this is called the Lorentz oscillator model.) How much the electrons oscillate also depends on how close the frequency of the light is to the electron-nucleus bound system, which is why refractive index varies by wavelength. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number typically referred to as &quot;the speed of light&quot;, or c, is really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank">the speed of light in vacuum</a>. When traveling through materials, the speed light appears to travel is slower due to interactions with atoms in the matter. However, the speed of light in vacuum is important because it turns out c also sets the speed limit for which any influence between physical systems can propagate in space. In other words, light moving in vacuum moves as fast as any particle can move in any material, on macroscopic length scales at least.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light does change as it passed through different media.  The constant you always hear about is the speed of light in a vacuum.  That is because a vacuum is the same everywhere.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Light is a electromagnetic wave.  The electrical and magnetic properties of the substance does change the speed that the wave propagates.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the speed of light is actually given by 1/sqrt(mu0 eps0) where mu0 and eps0 are some constants in electromagnetism. However, in a material, light will interact with its environment, and it’s often appropriate to use the constants mu and eps instead (material-dependent) which gives rise to a different speed of light in the material.</p>
<p>However, the fundamental statement is that ALL massless objects will travel at some universal speed c; you shouldn’t think of light as being special in this regard, because particles like gluons will also propagate at c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
