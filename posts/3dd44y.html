		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dave Brown (firearms safety specialist) did a quite <a href="http://filmcourage.com/content/filming-firearms" target="_blank">interesting Q&amp;A</a> with your question in it:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q - First of all, let’s open with the question that always comes to mind whenever we think of firearms on film sets. Brandon Lee. What happened?<br />
A - Well, like most serious incidents, it was not one big mistake but rather a chain of contributing factors. It actually began two weeks before that tragic night on the set of “The Crow.” The production needed some dummy cartridges for a close-up shot of loading a revolver.  Not knowing better, they purchased real cartridges from a local gun store, pried off the bullets, dumped out the gunpowder and stuck the bullets back into the cases. Now, any firearms expert would be able to tell you that this is highly dangerous because, of course, the primers were still live, but unfortunately they were running out of both time and money at this point and had already sent their only firearms expert home early to save a few dollars.<br />
While filming the close-ups, the actor they brought in for the scene was supposed to be supervised but the props assistant in charge of the firearm was busy doing other props work and left the actor on their own. Some witnesses reported they then saw the background performer pull the trigger while the “dummy” cartridges were still loaded in the chambers.<br />
What people may not know is that if the primer is still live, when you pull the trigger there is no sound but the spark from the primer can expel a bullet an inch or two forward even with no gunpowder in the case. At the end of the day, the props assistant emptied out the cartridges and put the gun away. He knew nothing about cleaning the gun, let alone checking the barrel for
obstructions.<br />
Two weeks later, this same revolver loaded with blanks was used to fire at Brandon Lee. Again, the props assistant handling the gun had no clue how to check it for safety and simply loaded it with blanks. There was no firearms expert on set to instruct the actor how to “cheat” the angle to the side so that it doesn’t get pointed directly at the actor when fired.<br />
Now, a blank has as much as twice the amount of gunpowder as a real cartridge and when that bullet was still lodged in the barrel from two weeks previous, the blank propelled the bullet out the barrel with the same explosive force as a real cartridge. The bullet struck Brandon Lee in the chest and he collapsed, never regaining consciousness. He died on the operating room table 13 hours later.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The set of The Crow was plagued with problems from the get go, including one worker that was severely burned by a live electrical wire, another flipped out and drove through the studio’s plaster workshop, and another carpenter accidentally drove a screwdriver through his hand. There was one particularly disturbing incident in which an actor was double-checking the gun he was supposed to shoot a person with, and found a live bullet instead of blanks. These things probably happen all the time, but in retrospect they become very important to this story’s mystique.</p>
<p>It was the 50th day of a 58-day shoot. The crew was partially non-union...The Crow’s special-effects man, J.B. Jones, had years of experience dealing with weapons on the TV series Miami Vice, and stunt coordinator Jeff Imada was also on the soundstage and had attended rehearsals of the scene, offering advice. However, since all the work involving semi-automatic weapons on The Crow had been finished days earlier, the film’s weapons specialist had already left the set. The Prop masters took over from there.</p>
<p>One of the main causes of Lee’s death was that because of a lack of dummy cartridges to fill the .44-caliber revolver with, one of the prop masters decided to remove the gunpowder from some of the live rounds, also replacing the bullet tips.  This was supposedly thought to have made the set of dummy rounds needed for shooting.  Upon shooting, the bullet tip was accidentally freed and became wedged in either the cylinder or barrel of the gun.  The prop master Daniel Kuttner filled the gun being used with blanks. The error he made was not checking the gun barrel for obstructions.</p>
<p>In the fatal scene, which called for  Actor Michael Massee, who played Funboy to fire the revolver  at Lee from a distance of 3.6 - 4.5 meters (12–15 feet) in a scene where he comes home to find his girlfriend being raped, the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round</p>
<p>Rehearsal went fine. While camera’s were rolling, and the gun was fired, Lee pulled a trigger hidden behind the grocery bag to set off a &quot;squib,&quot; a small explosive device designed to create the appearance of the grocery bag bursting within, stuck by a bullet. After setting off the squib, Lee collapsed on the set, bleeding profusely through the right side of his abdomen. He let out a groan and just collapsed. The scene played on, with Massee’s co-villain muttering in a panic, that Massee had shot the man. Things appeared normal, although Lee didn’t hit the floor the same way as they rehearsed. Brandon motioned with his arm, trying to signal distress, but everyone was too involved in the action to notice. Some thought Lee’s acting was extraordinary. One person on the set remembered hearing a faint call from Lee as he lay clutching his belly on the floor, &quot;Cut, cut, somebody please say cut…&quot; The director yelled, &quot;Cut!&quot; Lee did not get up.</p>
<p>At first the crew thought he was joking, but when realization kicked in, panic erupted... Paramedics arrived, and put inflatable pants on Brandon, to push the blood from his legs back to his upper body. Lee’s heart had stopped once on the set and once in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. They arrived at the Emergency Room entrance about 30 minutes after the accident. Brandon was taken to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) where he was operated on for six hours, and he given 60 pints of blood. </p>
<p>The entry wound was the size of a silver dollar, and it extended in a straight line to the spine. Surgeon Warren W. McMurry, who attended to Lee, said that Brandon had &quot;suffered intestinal injuries and major vascular injuries consistent with a bullet wound, and that X-rays appeared to show the bullet lodged in Lee’s spine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, detectives arrived on the set, and reviewed videotape made of the scene during filming, which indicated that Lee’s right side was in line with the angle of the pistol that was fired for the scene. Technicians on the set had unloaded the gun and placed it and the spent shell of a blank round into a plastic bag. They learned that one of the dummy shells in the gun case was missing the slug from its tip.</p>
<p>Brandon’s fiancé arrived at the hospital around noon, and his mother Linda was on her way from her home in Idaho. At 1:03 p.m., Brandon died. He was 28 years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia provides an analysis that explains:</p>
<p>In the scene in which Lee was accidentally shot, Lee’s character walks into his apartment and discovers his fiancée being beaten and raped by thugs. Actor Michael Massee's character fires a .44 Magnum revolver at Lee as he walks into the room.[8] <strong>A previous scene using the same gun had called for inert dummy cartridges fitted with bullets (but no powder or percussion primer) to be loaded in the revolver</strong> for a close-up scene; for film scenes which utilize a revolver (where the bullets are visible from the front) and do not require the gun to actually be fired, dummy cartridges provide the realistic appearance of actual rounds. <strong>Instead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film's prop crew created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge then reinserting the bullets. However, they unknowingly or unintentionally left the live percussion primer in place at the rear of the cartridge. At some point during filming the revolver was apparently discharged with one of these improperly-deactivated cartridges in the chamber, setting off the primer with enough force to drive the bullet partway into the barrel, where it became stuck</strong> (a condition known as a squib load). The prop crew either failed to notice this or failed to recognize the significance of this issue.</p>
<p>In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 3.6 - 4.5 meters (12–15 feet), the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since <strong>the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round</strong>, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him.[9] </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This tragic accident is a big reason why most movie studios now use <em>only</em> blank-firing guns on set.  These are specially made firearms that cannot shoot normal ammunition, and only work with blank cartridges.</p>
<p>Blank-firing guns have specially designed chambers so a full cartridge (one with a lead bullet in the end) won't fit.  Additionally, the barrel is obstructed so there's only a tiny hole to allow the flash to escape, but not a bullet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the death of actor Jon Erik Hexum. He was playing Russian Roulette with a set pistol that he knew for certain was loaded with blanks. By all accounts he was not suicidal, so when the cartridge went off, he apparently was under the impression that the blast would only have the force of a puff of air. The gas pressure-wave that came out of the barrel knocked a piece of bone from his skull into his brain just enough to kill him. </p>
<p>If you have watched a movie and seen pistols go off and the pistol doesn't seem to lift up at all, it's obvious that blanks do not have the recoil of a &quot;real&quot; cartridge, but...it was enough. I personally would have been just as afraid of the noise damaging my hearing as I would be of the blast (if someone jokingly held up a blank-cartridge pistol to my head)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
