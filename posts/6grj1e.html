<blockquote>
<p>How would Puerto Rico becoming a US State work? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Puerto Rico would have a referendum and decide if they want to be a state. </p>
<p>Congress would vote if they want to start the statehood process for Puerto Rico</p>
<p>Congress and Puerto Rico's territorial congress would work together to create a state constitution.</p>
<p>Once that constitution is agreeable to both Congress and Puerto Rico a final vote in Congress happens to admit Puerto Rico as a state.</p>
<p>The President signs that bill and The US has 51 states</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would the powers that be of USA want this to happen?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle the powers that be would have is adding Puerto Rice adds 2 senators and 4 or 5 congressmen, along with the 6 or 7 electoral votes that go along with those.  This would concern one party if the other was more heavily represented in PR also this would diminish the voting power of smaller states especially the 3 vote states.  Puerto Rico would also probably be a net taker of federal taxes but that depends on a lot of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What would the impact be to the country as a whole to gain a new state? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Day to day nothing really changes, Puerto Rico is basically a state now. There is free travel to and from the territory and free work access.  it would really only effect election time.  Taxes would increase for Puerto Ricans as they don't pay Federal Income Tax, but their tax burden may shift around to even that out, it depends on the exact way they are admitted as a state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I can't speak for the rest of your questions, but I would imagine it would be a very lucrative time to be a flag manufacturer. Imagine needing to change every American flag in the country? Probably big business to be had. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. PR is trying to access US bankruptcy laws via an upgrade to statehood. The vote there was &quot;nonbinding&quot; meaning it was basically a popularity contest. Only the United States Congress has the power to admit a new state. I doubt we'll be adding a new star anytime soon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
