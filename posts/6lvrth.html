		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>As a follow up:</strong> </p>
<p><em>If</em> the answer is humans are the only animal that can track using foot print (etc) cues, would this be because of our cognitive ability to think about the problem? </p>
<p>Scent can directly set off memory cues for a wolf, or urine under UV ability will show to be a rodent (because of certain chemicals left in the trails). But foot prints take a whole lot of perception such as what sort of animal is that? Is that worth the chase? Are these tracks new or old? If that animal injured because the one foot is limping (and I'm sure there's a lot more to it that an actual hunter could add there).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, as a contrapositive to your question, there must be or must have been something in the ocean that hunts visually, which resulted in the molluscs developing such a ridiculous camouflage system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
