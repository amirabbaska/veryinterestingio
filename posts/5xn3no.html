<p>It seems like it that would leave a relatively minor part of it to synthesize.. so why is blood plasma so precious that encouraging people to sign up for having needles stuck in them is the most efficient way of obtaining it?</p></div></div>

Proteins are very long, complex molecules that your body makes to take care of all sorts of things, including carrying different types of nutrients, mediating cell reproduction, and making other molecules your body needs.  Proteins are extremely difficult to synthesize in a lab, so it's more than worth it to ask people to donate blood plasma.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to synthesize proteins, is not easy. </p>
<p>Step 1. Identify the gene sequence that makes the protein.</p>
<p>Step 2. Synthesize that sequence </p>
<p>Step 3. Insert the sequence into a circular strand of DNA called a plasmid. </p>
<p>Step 4. Shove the plasmid into ecoli or some type of cell line.</p>
<p>Step 5. Kill off anything that doesn't have the plasmid. </p>
<p>Step 6. Harvest the growth media of your culture and isolate the protein.</p>
<p>This is extremely simplefied, and only works in the simplest of cases, but this kind of thing would take a lab several months to do. For a single known protein. </p>
<p>In serum there are proteins that we don't have sequences for, or that we haven't mapped from the genome yet. </p>
<p>There are also a lot of things in serum that aren't proteins, while it's the most obvious answer, it's probably an incorrect one. </p>
<p>The most valuable components are probably the clotting factors, platelets, and the like. While I know they're used in the blood clotting response and I know a decent amount about platelets and why we can't make them in a lab, I don't know much about the other factors. </p>
<p>(They're literally called &quot;factor #&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>It is a relatively small proportion of the plasma to synthesize but it is also much more complex series of structures which would need to be synthesized. To my knowledge the ability to do so is not available at this point, although I imagine it is a target of interest for researchers.   Until then we'll have to keep on donating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
