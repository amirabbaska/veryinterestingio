		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using only existing transmissions - you'd get to around 2-3 light years before even our strongest current TV, radio and etc. signals become indistinguishable background noise from the cosmic microwave background radiation. This can be calculated using the inverse square law as /u/lunchlady55 mentioned.</p>
<p>However, these are broad transmissions that use lots of power to make sure the transmission reaches the largest area possible. This is great if you want to send data to many different locations that are relatively close, and if you aren't exactly sure of the coordinates/location of where you want to send the data - you want a wide range so anybody close by can tap into your signal.</p>
<p>But we have ways to extend that 2-3 LY range by a lot. With our current technology, we could aim the signal in a very narrow beam at a specific location instead of an expanding &quot;sphere&quot; of transmissions centered on the broadcaster; this would extend our range to somewhere in the realm of 500 LY.</p>
<p>Here's a visualisation: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f6s93yv.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/f6s93yv.png</a> - Earth being the blue circle, and the range being the green area. The targets are the red rectangles. This is horribly, <strong>horribly</strong> not to scale - only to show a concept.</p>
<p>See how the green area has a much smaller area even though it reaches further away? This means we can get much further out with less energy, since we're sure of where we want to aim it and don't have to send out a huge 'sphere' of communications to reach the red rectangle (our target) - it's unnecessary. </p>
<p>So, in summary - if we set another Earth around 2-3 LY away we'd only be able to detect the transmissions barely. However, if they shot a very focused beam directly at us, we could set them much further out - around ~500 light years, depending on factors like the transmitter, receiver, what part of the EM spectrum you used (radio, micro, infra etc.) and size of the detector.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, I made that graphic in Microsoft Word... it got the job done, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is no definite information on this, but estimates using the inverse-square law, average TV station transmission power, and the transmit power of the most distant Voyager probe are a few light years out before it all fades into background noise.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Addressing a different method of detection (not EM detection)</p>
<p>Once the James Webb telescope is online, we would at least have the ability to detect the oxygen atmosphere from dozens of light years; as long as the second Earth transited its sun (from our perspective).</p>
<p>That would not prove the existence of a technological civilization, but it would be a strong indicator of at least primitive life.</p>
<p>I do not believe the JWT would be sensitive enough to pick up water vapour in our atmosphere from 20 LY but a near future telescope likely will be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a big problem with detecting &quot;accidental&quot; EM emissions (i.e. those not intended to be detected from outer space): If your emissions are still recognizable several lightyears away, you're wasting energy. No need to make your TV signal so strong it can still be received around Vega. Our best bet for detecting a &quot;twin Earth&quot; would be looking for signals of early warning radars. Their signals are (or used to be) enormously strong and, by design, have to be aimed into space. They're also more directed than omidirectional antennas, reducing loss over distance. But I couldn't tell you how far their signal reaches. My educated, unscientific guess would be a few dozen lightyears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
