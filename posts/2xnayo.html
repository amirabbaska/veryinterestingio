		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a former professional auctioneer. My father was an auctioneer as was his father. It's that kind of culture. The auctioneer's chant is meant to create excitement and urgency. Auctions are briskly paced, often selling hundreds of lots in just a few hours. Buying and selling at auctions is a skill. eBay is not an auction. eBay is an online flea market. </p>
<p>What most of us do when we learn the chant is pick some filler phrases to augment the calling of the incremental numbers.  For instance &quot;I'm at a...&quot;  &quot;Would Ya give...&quot; &quot;What about a..&quot; We practice with a metronome to get the rhythm and bounce right and work on our showmanship. We are salesmen, but we are also performers. </p>
<p>So for instance, a common phrase would be &quot;I'm at a one hundred dolla bid, would Ya give one?&quot;</p>
<p>Some auctioneers are more clear than others. Some just suck at it and spit like Daffy Duck when they try to chant.</p>
<p>There are annual competitions conducted by the National Auctioneers Association where clarity, timing, originality, and presence are among the criteria judges observe. </p>
<p>We represent both the buyer and the seller and the auction house. We have licensed and legally regulated power to forge contracts with the word &quot;sold&quot; that bind both parties to the completion of the sale and will hold up in any United States court. </p>
<p>That being said, you should know that if you go to a live auction that the auctioneer is always in complete control. If the auctioneer isn't in control they aren't doing the job. Bidders do not control the sale, nor do the sellers. The auctioneer serves a critical function.  They are the last and final word as arbiter in any auction. They have legal powers to arbitrate, refuse bids, reopen bidding, force contractual obligation on buyers and much more. They must possess a license to auction in the state the sale takes place in and they are carefully regulated. </p>
<p>Sadly, auction culture is dying off in America. Online auctions are rapidly closing in on this fine old tradition. Yes, auctioneers have held the gavel during some atrocious times in our history but in truth the auctioneer is a cultural icon that served for hundreds of years at the heart of commerce everywhere. </p>
<p>I don't auction any longer, but I respect the tradition and the occupation and I hope I have shed a little light on what was once a great culture of commerce in our history. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Auctioneer here. All the auctioneer is really saying are the bids and numbers, with a request for the next bid in there as well. &quot;I have a $20 bid, I need $25, 20 I need 25. $25 bid I need $30, I have 25 I need 30. $30 bid now 35, 30 now 35. 30 now 35, 30 now 35, 30 now 35? Sold - $30, bidder number ___. Sometimes those &quot;fill words&quot; are said so fast, and so often, that over time the auctioneer's &quot;chant&quot; kind of mutates so that, for instance, &quot;dollar bid&quot; may sound like &quot;dallabing&quot; or something like that. I think it just goes so fast because of the sheer amount of material an auctioneer may have to go through in a night. I try to sell one item every minute, and we usually sell about 400-500 items a night in our weekly Kansas City estate and consignment auction. To that point, I do think it is silly for an auctioneer to still chant that rapidly if they're selling a single item, like a house, or doing a charity event where there are not many items up for bid and the bidders aren't used to an auction sales environment. </p>
<p>Edit: lost my money (Sold $35 changed to $30)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have 1500 different size and quality apples I need to sell in one day. The farmer tells me these apples are worth $5000 (damn good aples). I need to get as close to or more than $5000 to make any money on the apples for that day. I start at Apple 1 and need to get the buyers to pay 3.33 (repeating of course) for each apple to reach to my goal of $5000 in apples, unfortunately apple 1 is much smaller and bruised than apples 2-3-4 so I will sell it as quickly as possible because it has to sell and I also will need to sell 1,499 more of them. Buyer 1 needs small bruised apples so he bids and takes it home for $2. Buyers 2-3-4 need the biggest best apples and have to buy them to snuff out the apple selling competition so they bid more on Apple #2. It goes over $3 and I have achieved a maximum value for this Apple. I still have to do this 1,498 more times. Rather than negotiate price which takes time, I will continue to rapidly call out numbers so my buyers will place the value that they see this for in their heads. You must be a really sharp 5 year old to understand what I am saying so I am going to stop now. If you have any questions about the Auction industry I will answer them as a licensed auctioneer but for now, I am going to go find some apples. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The speed is important, too.  Because auctions are public events requiring an audience, time and attention are precious.  So the faster the autioneer can communicate information to the audience and receive a response, the faster the product is sold and the more products s/he can sell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
