Water from the ocean has a whole bunch of salt in it, even more than salty food. If there was as much salt in your food as there is in ocean water, the food would be too salty, it would taste yucky, and it would make your belly ache. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Found this on Reddit. Not sure if it was someone’s answer to your question because my phone is acting up lol . </p>
<p>“There is a lot more salt in salt water than we get in salty foods. The problem is osmotic pressure and chemical gradients within the body. Essentially water follows sodium. When we take in sodium it goes into out blood stream. When we take in a lot, our blood has more sodium then the fluid in our cells do. The water leaves the cells and goes into the blood stream to make the concentrations equal. Now we have to much water in our blood which increases blood pressure. Our kidneys are like what the fuck get this damn water outa here. So they dump water into our urine and we pee it out. now our cells are like what the fuck that was our water now we don't have enough and tells our brain to drink more. We drink more salt water and it all happens again until you die of dehydration”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean salt water is really, really salty. There is about 35 grams of salt per 1 liter of salt water. 1 gram of salt contains about 0.4 grams of sodium. So 1 liter of salt water has 14 grams of sodium. Your daily sodium requirement is about 2 grams (2000 mg).</p>
<p>You would reach your daily sodium intake drinking 1 L/14 grams x 2 grams per day = 142 mL or 4.8 fluid oz of salt water. This is about half a cup of salt water.</p>
<p>Edit: Should be daily 2 grams of sodium not 1 gram.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
