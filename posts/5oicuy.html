		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Single Market is essentially an agreement that we harmonise our laws and regulations so that everything is legal in all EU countries.</p>
<p>Without this, you can have conflicting laws in different countries, meaning some products are illegal in the other country.</p>
<p>For example, in the USA all eggs <strong>must</strong> be washed. In the EU, all eggs <strong>must not</strong> be washed. This means you cannot sell USA eggs in the EU, or EU eggs in the USA. (Washing eggs means the membrane breaks and they need to be refrigerated.) </p>
<p>As well as the regulations being harmonised, we don't have import duty to pay between EU countries. This means my car factory in the UK can import parts from Italy and Spain, and sell cars to Germany without having to pay a lot of duty. If we were to leave the single market, I would have to pay import duty on my Italy and Spain imports, then pay import duty again selling the finished cars to Germany. This would make my business much less competitive than one inside the single market. In the short term, this could cripple a lot of businesses.</p>
<p>While we are members of the single market, we have a voice in shaping the EU regulations. If we leave, then we'll have to obey all the regulations if we want to be able to export goods to the EU, but won't get any say in what those regulations are. In the long term, this could lead to us being forced into following regulations that aren't good for the UK, as its not economical to make a product just for the UK market. (Except for Kettles.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worry about the potential impact on the banking sector in the U.K. Love them or hate them, they are an enormous part of the economy. Not being a member of the single market could force banks to move to Frankfurt and reduce the UK's importance in world business.</p>
<p>I'm certainly no expert, just an observation so someone may correct me! Can a uk based bank still trade on that market if the U.K. Is not a member?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
