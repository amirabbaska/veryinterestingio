		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. 3DMG relies on rapid changes to momentum that would wreak havoc on a human body that weighs 150-200 lbs, especially since most of the force would be applied to one section of the body.</p>
<p>Your second question is the more important.</p>
<p>At 1.35 m/s^2 , there is a planetary body where the average human of the same dimensions would weigh only around 30 lbs, and furthermore large-scale monsters like the Titans could theoretically move around. Plus, it can be theoretically terraformed for human life. </p>
<p>That location is, of course, Saturn's moon, <strong>Titan</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered the gear physics well. Lethal forces across the board. It's the same type of issue that ruins FTL travel fantasies. </p>
<p>To expand a bit more on the animal side of the equation though, the mass of most creatures follows a cubic scaling with size, while their skeletal structures only increase squarely. The largest creatures are all in the ocean due to the water essentially supporting their masses against gravity. The largest titans would hardly be able to move, and their size itself might kill them. Breathing and cardiac issues would wreck them,  especially as bipedal mammals. In fact, the small ones, which are blocked by the wall, would be the only actual issue as predators. </p>
<p>So you would need either everything to be underwater, or go to a planetary body that allows both sides of the equation to be viable, and still the humans still might be too fragile to operate the gear properly. Think of how bungie cords work, then realize that the 3D cables won't be doing much stretching. They'd be more successful with crushing, falling, or tripping traps on Earth if not these celestial bodies, which won't have the oxygen levels to support huge beings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each one of their tethers has got to weigh at least 300 pounds or so right? If you shoot that from your waist while standing still, you would experience so much knock back that you would immediately fly backwards for at least a couple dozen feet (probably dead). Not only that, but it would take a crazy amount of energy to use and if it were gas powered, those tiny gas canisters they use wouldn't even hold enough gas for one good swing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes (it is possible to do so) but in practice no.</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>The gas powered gun for the tethers is possible and exists. They release gas to reorient themselves akin to a jetpack which is also possible though you'd need to eject the gas at incredible speeds. Basically it's a jetpack and Spiderman's webshooters rolled into one.</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>It causes incredible changes in momentum which would at the very least break bones.</p>
<p>It's basically a flying car to people who still use horse drawn carriages. I'm not going to say it'll never exist but it won't within ypur or your childrens lifetimes. And even then its usability is limited to Spiderman like swinging around.</p>
<p>Location: changing gravity only affects how fast the user falls (gravity is basically a constant vertical acceleration) and that's not a major issue if you can retract and shoot the cable fast enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
