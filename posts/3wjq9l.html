		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doing parody of things that actually exist can be a legal minefield, and one has to think about what you say to not be defamatory even if you're just joking.  No show can say that Mcdonalds uses rat meat in its burgers to save cost without immediately getting sued to death by Mcdonalds, but The Simpsons can say that Krusty Burger uses rat meat in its burgers.</p>
<p>Parody law is also unique in that being known as a parody artist makes you more immune from it, as reasonable people will not take what you're saying seriously.  South park is just so constantly over the top that it's hard to claim anything on the show is defamatory because who takes south parks claims seriously?  They literally had to write &quot;This is what the church of scientology actually believes&quot; under one bit because otherwise people would have assumed they were making things up.</p>
<p>On top of that South Park makes enough money that they can afford the legal resources to avoid saying something defamatory and defend themselves.  Most of the fear with parodying somebody isn't actually losing in court - it's simply getting hit with frivolous lawsuits by pissed off parties that you can't afford.  Fair use laws cover a LOT of parody.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are copyright rules - notably around fair use that apply,  the big media companies are giant incestuous pool of cross licencing and agreements.   If you want to keep Disney happy you don't do stuff that will offend them,  and in turn they won't do stuff to offend you essentially. </p>
<p>If you are small outfit you risk going broke fighting in court, even if you should win, if you are big you have agreements to play nice with other people's IP.  South Park gets to do stuff because they make enough money that legal fights are worth the risk, and comedy central/viacom  are willing to risk a fight over it because that's their business, and they can afford to fight and win.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC they wanted to outright say that Tom Cruise is gay but their legal team wouldn't allow it. So they asked if they can just show him doing gay stuff. (Being in bed with a guy etc) but legal again said no. So they just had im literally hiding in a closet with everyone begging Tom Cruise to &quot;Come Out&quot;. Also they revisited the idea with Tom working as a &quot;Fudge Packer&quot; in a Fudge Factory production line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fair Use laws cover it. Shows can use people's names, likeness, etc under the Parody portion. But they do just as a CYA. South Park, which is control by Comedy Central does it plainly cause very few people would sue over it. It would be a bad PR move for them and give awesome ratings for South Park. Such as the Scientology episode and the Allah episodes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
