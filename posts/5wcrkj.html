I have only just recently began to wonder what a sense of smell actually feels like. Is it like taste, but instead of &quot;feeling&quot; it in your mouth, it's in your nose? How far away can you smell things?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much impossible to explain what it feels like, but the basic idea is that you have receptors that respond to the presence of various chemicals, more strongly to some of them than to others. Things have a smell because of trace amounts of chemicals circulating in the air, and getting picked up by these receptors. You could say it works like a combination of hearing (transmission via air) and tasting (biochemical receptors). The way the sensation works is closer to tasting, I guess, but there are way more smells than tastes.</p>
<p>Because air carries these chemicals around, how far away you can smell things depends on airflow/wind, the concentration of the chemical at the source, and how easily your receptors can detect the chemical in question. For instance, smell receptors are <em>extremely</em> sensitive to the stuff they mix into domestic gas, ethyl mercaptan, basically one milligram per tonne of air can be smelled. Spill a barrel of that stuff somewhere and chances are people will notice tens of kilometers away (subject to wind direction). Many everyday things carry just a few meters or less, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was once reading a forum post for the game Mass Effect, in which someone was discussing a quote from the game, talking about biotic powers: <em>&quot;it would be like explaining colour to a creature without eyes&quot;.</em></p>
<p>And the forum poster was saying that it's completely possible to do that, by just explaining that certain objects can be differentiated from each other by the visible light they reflect in their environment. And that over the course of your life, you become familiar with the amount of light each item gives off and how it should behave. And can even feel uneasy when you detect a type of light that isn't expected for the object, or that possibility indicates danger.</p>
<p>It is similarly the case with smell. </p>
<p>Just as objects reflect visible light, they also give off a detectable scent into the air. Some objects more then others. And over the course of your life, you become familiar to how things should smell. And can immediately tell when something isn't right (food not smelling the way it should because it was turned), or that possibility indicates danger (the smell of natural gas or other flammable material).</p>
<p>To smell is almost like detecting a different type of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taste is akin to touch; it happens in a very specific location, and only in direct contact. You 'feel taste' with the specific part of your tongue that the thing is touching. </p>
<p>But smell is more like hearing; you don't really 'feel sound' with your ears, it's just something happening outside you. In the same way you don't really 'feel smell' in your nose - your brain maps the sensation to the outside world. </p>
<p>The quality of the sensation itself is perhaps closest to taste; we use it as a much more detailed sense of taste, in fact. When people get a cold and temporarily can't smell much, they complain that they can't taste anything. Which they can, it's just they've lost a good 80% of the bandwidth they're used to. </p>
<p>So yeah... taste-hearing is probably the best analogy I can give you.</p>
<p>As for how far away... it depends on the smell. Again like hearing, some things carry more than others.</p>
<p>A cardboard box has a distinct smell, ferinstance, but unless you're in a room full of them, you have to stick your nose right in it and sniff to pick it up. </p>
<p>On the other hand, some smells you can pick up from across the room or across a whole building, even if they're quite faint. If someone's reheating a dried-fish curry in the common-room microwave in my building, the whole floor will know about it, at the very least. </p>
<p>The scent of wattle (acacia) blossom is famous for its ability to carry; despite being only slightly noticeable even close up... on a warm summer night, you can sometimes still notice it half a mile away. </p>
<p>Also, we adapt to constant smells quite rapidly; we can sit at home all day and not notice anything, go out to the shops and when we come back realize that ew, the garbage needs taking out; the smell built up slowly from a low level, so we adapted without even noticing. Coming in from outside, however... ewww!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not easy to explain. I'd say the closest thing to it is taste. It's like tasting something in your nose, and it can actually affect how you taste food. As for range, it really depends. If you're outside with a breeze, you can smell something pretty far away (like a fire a few miles off) but if you're inside, it's usually just the immediate vicinity</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully you'll find it reassuring that smell is probably the least important sense in day to day life. I like the comparison others have made to it feeling like something between tasting and hearing -- it serves a similar function of detecting chemicals like with taste, but those chemicals are in the environment around you, like sound.</p>
<p>Smell and taste aren't really that strongly correlated. For example, a toasted asiago cheese bagel can have a powerful, repulsive smell, but taste mild in comparison. On the other hand, salty foods don't really have a &quot;salty smell&quot; but can have a strong taste. The big thing here is that we learn to associate smells with tastes. You can learn to like a bad smell if you know what is causing it.</p>
<p>Strong smells can have other effects too. Bad smelling food can make you feel nauseous, strong-smelling volatile chemicals (like gasoline) can make you feel light-headed. Good food smells can make you feel hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
