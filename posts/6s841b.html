		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really fascinating question. There's a book I highly recommend reading that discusses this very topic, called &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; by Jared Diamond. For the sake of answering your question, here's a couple of the reasons the book posits.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the relative ease of domesticating wheat compared to maize. The type of wheat that was grown by early civilizations was genetically almost identical to wild wheat. Maize required extensive artificial selection to become even the rather mundane crop that it was when Europeans arrived in the Americas. Wheat could also spread equatorially, which means fewer adaptations were required for surviving in different climates. Maize was domesticated in South America, had to adapt to survive the much hotter Central Americas, and then adapt again to survive the cooler North America. Early human's artificial selection to make maize a proper cereal crop took millenia, whereas domestication of wheat occurred quickly. Wheat also has a lot more protein in it than maize, which means it requires less supplement from other foods. All this stuff seems little, but the presence of a robust and nourishing cereal crop was one of the foundations of every early civilization. Settling down means you can't forage, and providing surplus food allows for people to specialize in things like &quot;making tools&quot; or &quot;writing things down&quot; instead of hunting all the time. These advances occasionally lead to improved farming techniques, and consequently a larger food surplus.</p>
<p>The lack of domesticated animals in the New World was also likely a contributor. Humans brought protodogs over the land bridge from Russia during the last ice age, but by then we were already superpredators. Almost every large land mammal that existed in the Americas was extinct within a few thousand years (bison and llamas being two of very few exceptions). Species like horses, pigs, cows, and sheep had evolved alongside humans and had developed means of avoidance or cooperation. The humans that migrated to the Americas were almost like an invasive species. Of the few large animals that the Native Americans left alive, only one ever was domesticated, the llama, and its use was quite isolated. Domesticated animals (especially the horse and cow) allowed Eurasian civilizations to benefit from nonhuman labor, pulling plows, turning mills, all work that is backbreaking for humans and... somewhat less so for other animals (I'm not going to pretend that humans were nice to these animals, but having four legs is an advantage in pure traction). Living in close proximity to such a diverse group of animals also bred powerful new diseases. Tuberculosis, for example, is believed to have jumped to humans from animals. These diseases grew more powerful in the many densely-packed cities that formed in Eurasia, and ravaged the defenseless Native Americans when the two cultures met.</p>
<p>These advantages basically gave Eurasian people a couple thousand years or so head start, and as I mentioned before, the production of surplus food allows specialization and technological innovation, which often compounds the surplus and drives further growth. But I do highly recommend that book if you're interested in the development of ancient cultures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Inca were not aware of the Aztec, and the Aztec had little contact with the plains Indians.  The plains Indians had little contact with Inuit tribes.</p>
<p>The north-south orientation of the landmass meant that technology developed by one nation would take many centuries to disseminate because travel was so difficult.  Jungle empires can't cross the desert, and desert tribes can't cross the jungle.</p>
<p>In Eurasia, you can stick to a single climate band from Madrid to Seoul.  The Romans knew of the Chinese and sporadically traded with them, allowing technology to spread quickly across nations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add to what other people said.  An interesting geographic aspect of Europe is that it is separated by small - but passable barriers.  England is separated from Europe by a channel - not an ocean.  Italy is separated from Europe by the Alps, but not the Himalayas.  </p>
<p>This led Europeans to split into slightly isolated countries.  They were separated from each other - but not enough to prevent trade or war.  So you ended up with a pretty much constant state of trade and war.  Both of those things lead to technological innovations.  </p>
<p>To put it another way - if Europe was one big plain with no rivers or seas separating it into different countries - it probably would have been ruled as one Empire for thousands of years without splitting and fighting, and technology would have stagnated.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suggest you re-ask this question in r/AskHistorians</p>
<p>This sub has too many folks talking out of their butts about stuff they don't know anything about, or seeing needless offense in your question. </p>
<p>The short, short summary I will give you is that European technology was a result of building off technology that came from many different cultures from not just Europe, but Africa, Middle East and Asia. There was constant trade from the dawn of human history that resulted in a lot of technological breakthroughs. You had tons of cultures sharing technological secrets and just building up and up. </p>
<p>The Native Americans were completely cut off from these achievements, such as the major achievements made in metallurgy and the sciences. While some south american tribes did have metallurgy techniques like smelting and molding, it wasn't anywhere near as advanced as what was developed on the other continent, and they remained isolated from the tribes in the northern continent.  For technology to prosper requires trade, and the development of long distance trade routes seen among Europeans, Easterners, Africans and Asians never occurred in the Americas until the Europeans came over and created it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
