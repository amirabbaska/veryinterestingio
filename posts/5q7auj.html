		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it could be visual snow, but more likely what you're seeing is called eigengrau.</p>
<p>To explain, the way your eyes see in dim light is for particles of light to enter the eye and strike the rods of the eye, specifically activating a protein called rhodopsin. This protein is extremely sensitive to light, which enables us to see in very dim light, but is also so sensitive that it can be activated by the heat of your body. Since, even in pitch black, some of this rhodopsin would be activated by the heat of your body, you see a dark grey when you close your eyes instead of pure black. When your eyes are open this dark grey is actually the darkest color you can see, your brain just  compares it to the other lighter objects around it and you interpret the object as a pure black.</p>
<p>True ELI5, your eyes can never see pure black because the chemical in your eyes that let you see in dim light is so sensitive they can activate from the heat of your body, making your brain interpret a dark grey instead of a pure black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

More than half the time though it progresses into full blown images to the point that I can dream while fully awake. (Not to be confused with lucid dreaming) still entirely conscious during this. Not much luck looking that up, anyone got any idea? </p>
<p>Been like that as far as I can remember. Always thought it might be a combination of the visual snow and a very visual focused mind. </p>
<p>Edit: this only happens in pitch black btw</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably not visual snow, which should be visible at all times. The reason is because in darkness your eye and brain essentially turn up the volume on the signal from your eyes. It's like when speakers hiss if you turn the volume up to max without anything playing - tiny random fluctuations are amplified so that they are perceptible.</p>
<p>In normal conditions the sensitivity is turned down or other bright objects swamp the noise so you can't hear it, but this doesn't happen in the dark. The advantage is that you can find your way out of the bedroom for a slash without waking up your wife.</p>
<p>Fun fact: your brain also tries to maximise your ability to see in the dark by using several seconds worth of data from your eyes to form an image. This makes moving objects look blurry and hard to discern in the dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
