		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A shockwave needs a medium. An explosion can impart enough energy to nearby air to push it out of the atmosphere, but at that point it's not really a shockwave, just ejected gas. The energy is no longer being carried between particles, but is simply carrying one particle through space. A planet can actually completely lose its atmosphere through repeated event like this, and it's believed that happened to Earth during the Late Heavy Bombardment, about 4 billion years ago.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All that said, the space around Earth is not a perfect vacuum, and so some of the ejected gas will impact other particles, scattering the energy outwards as in a shockwave. But for anything less than a literally Earth-shattering explosion the energy will quickly become so spread out that its effect on the interplanetary medium will become negligible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But a supernova--the death of a large star--is so stupendously powerful that it does create a shockwave even through the very thin interstellar medium, and we can detect &quot;bubbles&quot; of lower density gas that have been cleared out by these explosions. So even though we like to say there's no sound in space, with a sufficiently large and sensitive receiver you could, in theory, pick up the sound of a supernova even from hundreds of light-years away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you are asking what happens to vertically traveling shock waves as they propagate upward. Waves interacting with the upper atmosphere is a very important part of the over atmospheres energy balance, but a shockwave is a special case. At very low pressures the gas molecules are spread out enough that collisions are no longer dominating movement and other forces start to become important.</p>
<p>The bottom line is shockwaves, do not last long as more molecules go zipping past their neighbors and disperse their energy elsewhere. The upper atmosphere is where density driven waves go to die as the coherent fluid propagation of mechanical collision decays into the random motion of temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An explosion is a chain reaction of ignition which creates more energy than safely dissipates into the surroundings. The initial reaction compresses the particles around it, and those particles react, ignoring, and this continues until am the fuel is used up. The shock wave is the left over energy not released as heat and light. Energy can be radiation, like the sun or transmission, through a medium. So a shockwave is matter which is pushed from behind really fast. </p>
<p>A shock wave requires particles to collide,  transferring energy so rapidly, the energy continues until it dissipates through the square/ cube law. The shockwave moves outwards rubbing the air molecules together ( nitrogen,  oxygen, methane etc). The rubbing releases energy bit by bit. As the shockwaves moves upwards, the number of air molecules decreases. The particles moving upwards have fewer particles to crash into. The shock wave becomes a hail of energised particles. If you are large enough (plane) you might feel a push from a large enough cloud of molecules transferring their energy into your aircraft. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
