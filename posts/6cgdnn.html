		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a radiation therapy clinic.  Patients generally don't feel a thing, in fact some even ask us after a treatment if we remembered to turn the machine on.  The consequential damage radiation does is mostly at a genetic level, so it doesn't have a noticeable effect until cells try to use their DNA to divide or make some more proteins, or the cell inspects the DNA and finds damage.</p>
<p>A sufficiently high dose could in principle increase someone's temperature noticeably, but the dose needed for that would be way above the lethal threshold.  A lethal dose only adds as much heat to a body as drinking a <del>cup</del> sip of coffee.</p>
<p>Some patients receiving high-dose therapy to their brains report some sensations during treatment.  Unclear if real or imagined.</p>
<p>In the early days of accelerator-based radiotherapy there were some accidents where a machine accidentally delivered a dose ~100&times; higher and faster than intended, and the patients reported a feeling like an electrical shock.  That may have actually been an electrical shock though, as the electron radiation carries a charge with it.  (Machines are now built with physical interlocks to prevent that type of accident from ever happening again).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Interestingly, Louis Slotin reported that he experienced a sour taste in his mouth and a burning sensation after he was exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.   There isn't really a well understood neurological reason for this, and it's kind of hard to confirm since he's one of the few people to receive a lethal dose.  We would need a double-blind study where we irradiate people, with and without their knowledge, to definably answer this question.  That might be a tad unethical though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked this originally because I watched K-19: The Widowmaker. If you haven't watched it, they did a really good job simulating the effects of radiation sickness. What caused me to ask this is someone was unable to get off the floor in the reactor because they were so poisoned and Harrison Ford had to go into a highly irradiated area to pick the person up. I was curious as to IRL if he had done that (gone into a reactor with no suit on) if he would have felt anything just going right in there and going back out to  a clean area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So extreme radiation can increase temperature.  But for the most part you can receive a fatal dose of radiation and you wouldn't know until you start dying from it.</p>
<p>Depending on how high the level is based on &quot;high&quot;.  It is possible you would know, but at that point, the radiation is so intense you are as good as dead by the time you realize it. </p>
<p>I think the &quot;elephants foot&quot; that Chernobyl created is a good example: <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/chernobyls-hot-mess-the-elephants-foot-is-still-lethal" target="_blank">http://nautil.us/blog/chernobyls-hot-mess-the-elephants-foot-is-still-lethal</a></p>
<p>&quot;After just 30 seconds of exposure, dizziness and fatigue will find you a week later. Two minutes of exposure and your cells will soon begin to hemorrhage; four minutes: vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. 300 seconds and you have two days to live. &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe I read something on this when the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened. I have to find the article (which I read years ago) where attending firefighters stated that as they got closer to ground zero, they felt the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A metallic taste in their mouth</li>
<li>Everytime they closed their eyes they would see something that looked like fireworks</li>
<li>What seemed like a pricking of needles all over their face and exposed areas</li>
<li>Impending heat in the abcense of an open flame. </li>
</ol>
<p>Needless to say, all these firefighters ended up dying from radiation sickness. It seems that what you feel depends on the amount of exposure to radiation. I'll try to find the article for your review.</p>
<p>(Edit 1: grammar and spelling errors)</p>
<p>Well I can't find that article at the moment but instead I'll give you a consolation article that explains the story of Hisashi Ouchi...the nuclear plant worker that was kept alive for 83 days. Please note the pictures are NSFW.</p>
