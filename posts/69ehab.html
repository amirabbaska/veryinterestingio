		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most exciting thing in a baseball game to me is not necessarily the outcome, but the process of watching a pitcher duel with a hitter.</p>
<p>There's so much more going on at the plate that a casual fan may not be aware of. All of the three main players in an at bat - the pitcher, catcher, and batter - have all studied each other. This leads to an intricate mind game that enhances the pure physical battle of trying to make bat meet ball. </p>
<p>The pitcher and catcher know the batter's tendencies in (1) what pitch counts he likes to swing, (2) where he favors the ball, (3) what types of pitches he tends to hit, and (4) his timing/swing/posture at the plate.</p>
<p>Likewise, the batter has studied them in the same ways, knowing (1) what pitches the pitcher has at his command, (2) when he likes to throw certain types of pitches, (3) where he likes to locate those pitches, and (4) his rhythm/motion/pace of pitching.</p>
<p>And - to add to the complexity - the guys know the other has studied them. So each has to be self-aware of their vulnerabilities and how they match up with the player they're facing. If the pitcher is a guy who likes to be a flame thrower and wants to get outs based on his fastball speed and location, but the hitter is superb at hitting fastballs, he needs to adjust. Conversely, if the hitter isn't a guy who is likely to catch up to a good heater, he needs to know when and where this pitcher might throw a secondary pitch, a change up or type of breaking ball, to have a chance to hit it.</p>
<p>The batter's base line strategy is to not make an out. Depending on the game situation that can be modified in any number of ways, but the battle between pitcher and batter always remains. The pitcher is trying to maximize his strengths and pitch against the batter's vulnerabilities, while the batter is trying to capitalize on his knowledge of the pitcher to wait for a pitch he believes he can be successful at hitting safely. </p>
<p>This leads to many batters going to the plate looking for &quot;their pitch.&quot; Like in the previous example, a batter who isn't adept at hitting A+ fastballs against a power pitcher will go to the plate knowing that in certain pitch counts - let's say with one strike - the pitcher likes to throw a low breaking ball. The batter will key in on that particular pitch and hope that its in a good spot for him as he'll be ready to pounce on it. The batter also knows he's weak at fastballs above the belt so he needs to either be ready to take his best swing at one during the at bat or be OK with letting it go and waiting for a different pitch. Of course with two strikes he's got to be mentally ready for it either way and needs to adjust physically - choking up on the bat, shortening his swinging motion - to have a chance. </p>
<p>The battles between pitcher and hitter are different every time, and a lot of starting pitchers will save one of their pitches for the second or third time they are going through a line-up in a game so that they can keep the batters off-balance and not let them feel comfortable at the plate. The batters, knowing their own tendencies, will at times change their approach at the plate - ie, a guy who never swings at the first pitch will pounce on the first throw hoping to surprise the pitcher who might be throwing a &quot;get over&quot; pitch early in the count. So, history between two players is as important to them and relevant as the current at-bat, each trying to build upon what they've learned from previous encounters to gain the advantage. </p>
<p>There are few things more intense in sports than watching a great hitter and a great pitcher square off in a high pressure moment in a game. There's so much more going on that simply &quot;I want to get a hit.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: obligated to say thanks for the gold! My first. Truly appreciate it. </p>
<p>And I walked my dogs and thought more about this and wanted to add - all of this mentality aside - you have to then appreciate the fact these guys have to physically perform. The pitcher can know the perfect pitch to throw but he's got to execute it. The batter can be looking for their preferred pitch but has to make the good swing when they see it. And the batter has to be ready to capitalize on a mistake pitch in fractions of a second. If he's mentally prepared for a fastball inside but the pitcher hangs a curve on the outer third of the plate the batter needs to react and pound that meatball. </p>
<p>There's preparation - and that's so important and can go a long way towards success - and then there's execution. God I love baseball. </p>
<p>2nd Edit: A few people have asked for video examples. I found a video from MLB Network where former players Mark DeRosa and Carlos Pena talk about how they would approach facing Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta - who when this video was made had recently thrown two no-hitters and was the reigning National League Cy Young winner (aka the previous year's best pitcher). They preach going up against a guy like Arrieta as a hitter you have to have a game plan on what pitch you're looking for and where in the zone because if you don't - you're already out.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZKZvVYfANw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZKZvVYfANw</a></p>
<p>And another MLB Network video where Bill Ripken breaks down the different effect a simple fastball &amp; change-up combination can have on a hitter. These are the two most &quot;basic&quot; pitches in baseball and pitchers can get people out simply combining them effectively. Now you see what hitters are up against... and this before you throw in curves, sliders, cutters, sinkers, etc, and vast combinations of them.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends very much on the situation. Usually they are just trying for square contact, to get the ball out of the infield.</p>
<p>Some batters try to swing for the fences, as you say. If there is a runner on third and less than <del>one out</del> <strong>two outs,</strong> a batter may try to hit the ball up for a fly ball, so that the runner on third can tag up and score (sacrifice fly), even if the batter is out.</p>
<p>If the defenders are in a shift, the batter might try to hit the ball to the other side, even bunting it that way at times.</p>
<p>But usually, it's just hit the ball solidly, hard rather than soft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a former professional baseball I player I saw this thread and assumed the responses would be mostly horrendous. There are a lot of shysters out there that think they know a lot more about the game than they really do. That said I'm pleasantly surprised. Most of the responses were solid.</p>
<p>If this comment doesn't get buried, I recommend reading Pure Baseball by Keith Hernandez. It breaks down a couple real games pitch by pitch and gives some great insight from a veteran big leaguer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might be my favourite comment thread ever. I'll probably read the whole thing (I've been reading for like an hour and am only about halfway down, but I'm going to try for the rest). Basically like sitting with a collection of baseball fans and listening to them talk to people who want to know more. Thanks to all who commented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
