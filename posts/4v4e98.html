		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to the history of Hollywood imagery, but in the early 20th century there were a few <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2016/07/do-radioactive-things-glow.html" target="_blank">commonplace radioactive compounds that glowed green</a>, including the radium used in clock dials and uranium glass (this is no longer done for fairly obvious reasons).  The green glow isn't from the radioactive decay itself, but from electronic/atomic transitions which could be activated by the radioactivity.</p>
<p>There is also a blue glow from Cerenkov radiation associated with nuclear reactors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a reverse example of the movie trope affecting real radioactive items, I run a radiation lab and the most common radioimmunoassay kit we use has been adjusted by the manufacturer so that the radioactive compound (125-I in this case) ends up in a green mixture. It's a kit in which you mix your sample with 125-tracer and an antibody, and they've added colored dye to the two reagents: bright blue for the 125-I, bright yellow for the antibody. So when you mix all the reagents together you end up with a test tube rack full of bright green radioactive samples. I've been told the manufacturer chose those colors on purpose knowing that people associate bright green with radioactivity. </p>
<p>It certainly does help when there's newbies in the lab - &quot;Don't touch those tubes, they're radioactive!&quot; <em>points to rack of bright green samples in test tubes</em> (person backs away carefully) It gets people's attention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Film editor here. </p>
<p>In films, you have to establish the facts of a situation very quickly. A classic example is the 'baguette sticking out the top of a large brown paper bag' device used when a character needs to enter a scene.</p>
<p>I'll explain: let's say you have a scene set in a house, and you need a character to enter. If he (or she) just appears, the viewer immediately thinks 'where has he been?' 'How come he's just appeared now?' </p>
<p>By giving the character some shopping bags, it explains that he has just come back from the shops. A mystery has been explained visually, without any need for excessive dialogue explaining where he has just been. But if you give the character any old bags, the viewer will be thinking 'what's in the bag?' 'Why has he just been out shopping? What was he getting? Is it relevant to the plot?</p>
<p>By having a baguette sticking out the top of a brown paper bag it immediately establishes that he has just been doing a regular food shop, again without the need for dialogue explaining the situation. </p>
<p>Nobody in real life actually gets their supermarket shopping in a large brown paper bag with a baguette sticking out the top, but in film, it instantly transfers a wealth of information, and nobody will be questioning why that character has appeared in that scene at that moment.</p>
<p>In the same way, glowing green has become a device to say 'radioactive'. If you see something glowing green, you know it is radioactive without it having to be explained in dialogue. </p>
<p>I can't tell you why it was originally green rather than, say, blue. /u/shorvok suggests it originated in comic books which I can imagine is true. But the reason it is still used today is because it is a device to instantly transfer information to the viewer by using visuals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more of an art thing than an scientific accuracy thing. We've developed a visual language over time where color, shape, composition, and context are used to quickly and effectively communicate concepts without requiring verbal description.</p>
<p>None of this visual language is meant to be accurate. It's just easily understood (via common use) and also in visual media you want to maintain color balance so your images are pleasing to look at.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red is used to denote rage, danger, ill-intent, injury, etc. Angry people will often see in red. An injured person will have red marks (even when it might more accurately be black and blue). </li>
<li>White symbolizes innocence, good intentions or purity. As such, first aid is often depicted as white(purity) surrounding a red symbol(injury).</li>
<li>Yellow can symbolize youth, high energy, annoyance (as it's bright and attention getting). Hence Pikachu is depicted yellow. Sale or safety signs often use bright yellow.</li>
<li>Black is used for evil, anti-authority, ill intent, emptyness, etc... The backgrounds of many old videogames were left black to create depth and space. The Punisher wears black(evil, anti-authority) clothing with a big white(good intentions, purity) symbol on his chest helping to indicate him as an anti-hero.</li>
<li>Green is used to denote nature and etc.. except seeing green where green shouldn't be which denotes danger, illness, or unclean. Green skin is sick skin. Green food is rotten food. A green snake is poison. Green liquid is poison or radioactive. </li>
</ul>
<p>Visual mediums use the visuals as the primary means to communicate (films, comics), or the only means to communicate (painting). A well made film should be able to be understood without sound.</p>
<p>In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the space station is a depicted as a big white space. Hall 9000 has an all seeing red eye. As the story progresses the red eye is shown more and more, and the space station is gradually getting smaller and redder until the astronauts in white suits are in a cramped space completely lit in red. </p>
<p>Without telling you anything. You already know what's going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>The white space station is a safe, pure place in the black empty void of space.</li>
<li>The white suited astronauts are explorers with pure intentions (science, exploration).</li>
<li>The close ups of the HAL 9000's red eye symbolize his evil nature.</li>
<li>The astronauts are put into continually cramped spaces bathed in red light to symbolize their being in danger and HAL's evil intent. The red lighting is also visually linked to HAL's red laser eye. We know this is all HAL's doing without having to be told so.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's visual language at work. This scene works on mute. In fact, this movie has very little dialogue. But even dialog driven scenes rely on visual language through composition, color, and body language. Even on mute, the basic concept of a dialog scene's outcome will come across.</p>
<p>As such, you automatically know a green liquid, or a green glow is dangerous subconsciously. Anything else, and it has to be explained.</p>
<p>Citations: This is very broad. Read up on Color Theory, Color Meanings, Visual Storytelling, Artistic Symbolism. Watch 'Every Frame a Painting' on youtube. Study Stanley Kubrick movies. This stuff is not written down in any one place so much as picked up in bits and pieces. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Radium was the first radioactive element discovered, and it glows green. Watches and clocks had radium added to the hands and numbers so you could see them at night. Unlike the luminescent ones we now have, they glowed 24/7 not just for a little while after the light is turned off. Sadly they also actually emitted ionising radiation, and were not good to the factory workers who made them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
