<p>To our new visitors, welcome to this special corner of reddit where we ask and answer science questions 24/7!</p>
<p>Here's how it works: You come up with scientific questions that pique your interest, and get answers based on solid science from experts and knowledgeable members of the AskScience community. To keep our content high quality, we encourage you to post comments that...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>...are on topic, factual, and scientific</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...clarify questions and answers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...link to peer reviewed literature</p>
</li>
<li>...are free of idle guesses, speculation, and anecdotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>More extensive posting and upvoting guidelines can be found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/guidelines" target="_blank">here</a>. This community promotes high quality posts by upvoting science that's worth reading. Jokes, memes, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/s4chc" target="_blank">medical advice</a>, and off-topic banter are downvoted and reported. We remove these items to keep the discussion focused on science. Sometimes it is very convenient to phrase a follow-up post as a question to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for AskScience panelists. They are experts with at minimum, postgraduate experience in their field. They are are highly knowledgable contributors who are responsible for some of the best content that is posted to AskScience. If you qualify, we highly encourage you to make some posts to AskScience so you can <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1axwqz/askscience_panel_of_scientists_viii/" target="_blank">apply for flair</a>.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a panelist to answer questions in AskScience, but we do ask that you be educated in the field of the question you are answering. You should be prepared to substantiate your answers. Try to give answers that are scientific, but are at a level where someone without a background in the field can understand them.</p>
<p>Many questions submitted to AskScience undergo an editorial process before they appear. Not all questions make it to the front page. Please <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience" target="_blank">message us</a> if something is amiss -- we're here to help.</p>
<p>We'd now like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's helped bring us here today.</p>
<p>First, we'd like to give a big thank you to the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/about/team/" target="_blank">reddit admins</a> and /u/hueypriest in particular for making this happen. We're very grateful for their enthusiasm and support for science content on reddit. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to do on a larger scale what AskScience does best.</p>
<p>Next, we want to thank all of our panelists for continuing to share with us your insights and fascinating ideas about science. Your expertise and patience in answering questions is what has made our subreddit stand out as a source for enlightening scientific discourse.</p>
<p>Finally, to our nearly 800,000 AskScience subscribers -- thank you for your continued support. Your enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge is truly inspirational. It is a major reason why we volunteer everyday to keep this place running. We realize that we couldn't have come this far without you, and it was a major consideration in our decision to return this subreddit back to default. Many of you are visible ambassadors of AskScience and play a critical role in our success. </p>
<p>Please continue to welcome new redditors to this community and share the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette" target="_blank">best of reddiquette</a> that AskScience has to offer.</p>
<p>It's been a fantastic journey growing this subreddit from a handful of subscribers to the very popular forum that it is today. That said, we understand that many of you might have concerns about how being a default subreddit might change things here. Rest assured, the mods are keeping a close eye on things, and we will chart AskScience's future based on what we see from this new traffic.</p>
<p>This is a great moment to reflect and look forward to the future. To celebrate, please share your thoughts about AskScience below!</p>
<p>Keeping AskScience awesome,</p>
<p>The AskScience moderators</p></div></div>
