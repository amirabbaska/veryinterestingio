		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well simply put - <strong>Because our brains are bad at multitasking</strong> </p>
<p>Daydreaming is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings, during which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.</p>
<p>Day dreaming is not actual sleep (despite the word &quot;dream&quot;). It is simply a short-term detachment from your surrounding. Put simply, it it just your mind wondering. Like any other action you take, you do it with your eyes opened.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to our brains being very good at selective attention. It is impossible for the human brain to focus on every bit of information it receives, so instead it will focus on one or two main points and effectively ignore the rest.</p>
<p>When we form mental images, we use many of the same parts of the brain as we use to process visual images. So, when you bring up a vivid mental image, you aren't able to make full use of those areas to process what you're actually seeing. Obviously, there is still plenty of information coming in through your eyes, but since you are distracted, it is not processed as thoroughly as when you are focused on the world around you.</p>
<p>The same goes for when you bring a memory to mind. I've often been listening to someone talk, and when something they says triggers a memory, I might not even hear what they said for the next few moments. The brain isn't too great at multitasking.</p>
<p>There are many types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists, however the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild dissociation.</p>
<p><em>What part of the brain switches those controls saying to stop processing outside information and start imagining?</em></p>
<p>We are not sure. It gets tricky from here. Not sure if is understandable for a five year old :( Experts now agree, however, that daydreaming is a normal, and even beneficial, cognitive function-albeit one that is largely still not understood. An area of the brain called the “default network,” which becomes more active as the level of external stimulus decreases, is often considered responsible for daydreaming. The default network mainly includes the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the posterior cingulated cortex/precuneus region, and the temporoparietal junction </p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies have offered support for this hypothesis, though only indirectly. These studies demonstrated “correlations between reported frequency of task-unrelated thoughts and default network activation during conditions of low cognitive demand, as well as stronger default network activation during highly practiced compared with novel tasks in people with higher propensity for mind wandering.” A different interpretation of these data, offered by Gilbert et al., argued that “instead of mind wandering, activations in the medial PFC part of the default network may reflect stimulus-related thought such as enhanced watchfulness toward the external environment that is also likely to occur during highly practiced tasks”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baddeley's working memory model tells us there is a part of our mind called the central executive (located in the frontal lobes) that controls where our attention is focused, and filters out the rest. It decides what is relevant for you to feel or notice. Mostly through practice. </p>
<p>When you first hear a loud constant noise (say, roadworks outside) it bothers you - but after a while you stop noticing it, because the central executive registers it, but filters it out of your conscious perception. When the drilling stops you tend to notice the silence as a relief because that filter no longer has to work. It's why we study better in quiet environments. </p>
<p>Same goes for hearing your name in a crowded room - central executive processes all, but only sends over stuff you might find interesting or relevant. </p>
<p>When daydreaming, we are focused on introspection so our central executive puts other stimili on the backburner until you need them again. </p>
<p>It's also what those &quot;you are now breathing manually&quot; or &quot;you are now aware of the position of your tongue in your mouth&quot; memes take advantatge of. Sorry. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely fact check me, but what we learned was that when people start to day dream or think introspectively the portions of the brain that are used for attention and working memory (right parietal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) &quot;quiet down&quot; in the sense that they lower their activity rates and the default mode network turns &quot;on.&quot; The default mode network is a network of brain regions that become more activated when the brain is focusing less on outside stimuli and more on internal reflection, day dreaming, or even meditating.   This network changes then Brian waves from beta (alert and active) to alpha (awake but relaxed). That's part of the reason people &quot;snap out of it&quot; when interrupted while daydreaming. Basically when zoning out different regions of the brain get activated and the higher thinking centers quiet down so you are less aware of what's going on in the outside world and more aware of your internal monologue, thoughts, feelings, etc. </p>
<p>Paragraph and Sources: In neuroscience, the default mode network (DMN), also default network, or default state network, is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other and distinct from other networks in the brain.[3]</p>
<p>The default mode network is most commonly shown to be active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering. But it is also active when the individual is thinking about others, thinking about themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future.[3][4] The network activates &quot;by default&quot; when a person is not involved in a task. Though the DMN was originally noticed to be deactivated in certain goal-oriented tasks and is sometimes referred to as the task-negative network,[5] it can be active in other goal-oriented tasks such as social working memory or autobiographical tasks.[6] The DMN has been shown to be negatively correlated with other networks in the brain such as attention networks.[7] Thinking about others also could include guessing their thoughts, emotions, and psychological motivations.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain has several commonly used paths of neurons, the cells in our brain that hold and conduct electric charges , we call these paths networks. When you're daydreaming, the network known as the Default Mode Network is more active. The DMNs activity is inversely proportional to the activity in the Dorsal Attention Network, which is more active when you're consciously thinking about something like math, higher-order reasoning, or anything where you feel like you're concentrating. So the DMN is active when you're thinking about nothing, when you're daydreaming or really any time you aren't concentrating

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a clear switch. When you imagine things, your visual areas of the brain light-up just as if you were really seeing, your areas for movement and control of coordination also light up like your really there. All that's missing is... very little actually. Which is why what we experience in reality and what we experience in our imaginations are one continuum of what we imagine to be reality.
