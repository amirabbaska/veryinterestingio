		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General purpose computers were the result of massive investment into computing technology and electronics during the war. To win the war all sides invested heavily to build the best code cracker, trajectory calculator, computer bomb sight, flight simulators, etc. After the war the countries that got out of it best economically were Great Britain, America and Canada. They continued to develop computing and microelectronics while the other countries were investing more in infrastructure. So the first assembly languages were written with English mnemonics. This also continued with the development of new programming languages. There were programming languages in other languages like Russian but these were not widespread and disappeared after the personal computing bubble in the early 80s that originated in California and England and further so after the collapse of the Soviet Union as they stopped producing computers.</p>
<p>If it were not for the second world war it might have been that the computer development came from Poland and fueled by the German economy and not from England fueled by the American economy and we might have seen different languages being used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the answer given by /u/Concise_Pirate, there are actually some programming languages with keywords taken from other natural languages. For example, ARLOGO is an Arabic-based language (currently in beta, I believe), SAKO is in Polish. An example of the &quot;Hello World&quot; program in Linotte, a French-based language, looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>BonjourLeMonde:
  début
    affiche "Bonjour le monde !"</code></pre>
<p>Most of these, though, are really intended for beginners and not for professional use (Linotte's slogan, for example, is: &quot;Tu sais lire un livre, alors tu peux écrire un programme informatique,&quot; which translates as: &quot;You know how to read a book, so you can write a computer program&quot;).</p>
<p>In addition to that, some existing languages are given localizations: Chinese BASIC is, well, BASIC with Chinese keywords, while hForth is a Korean version of Forth. Also, macros in MS Word and MS Excel are localized, so if you install the German version of Excel, you have to write all the macros in German.</p>
<p>Finally, there's APL, which has no keywords in any natural language, instead using symbols and mathematical operators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at programming languages whose style documents specifically require English.</p>
<p>Python was created by a Dutch programmer ( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido Van Rossum</a> ) and its foundational style/philosophy ( <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP 8</a> ) guide explicitly not only names English as its official language, but even names a famous English grammar book to reference <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id29" target="_blank">when writing comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When writing English, follow Strunk and White.</p>
<p>Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never be read by people who don't speak your language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: not Danish but Dutch, whoops </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because English-speaking people invented programming languages. And the usages of English within programming language syntax aren't a large barrier to a non-English speaker attempting to learn the language.</p>
<p>But fun fact, Apple made a language called AppleScript back in the 90s. It was a sort of natural language programming language, so it would read like an English sentence (e.g. &quot;tell application Finder to&quot; was a valid language construct). But they <em>also</em> maintained a Japanese language version of this too that would read like a Japanese sentence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
