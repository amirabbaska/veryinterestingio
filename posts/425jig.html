<p>EDIT: I know the meeting of probe and hypothetical Planet IX is pretty much impossible but I just wanted to know how long it's gonna take for eventual new probe to reach orbit and/or planet. If it really exists.
Just a random question that came up to my mind that I wanted to know answer to.</p>
<p>PS. Holy shit this blew up. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Presently, this planet is hypothetical. There have not been direct observations of this object - it's existence has been inferred from the orbits of smaller bodies in the outer solar system (i.e. they move as though their orbits are being perturbed by a large distant body). </p>
<p>With that out of the way, the media says this planet orbits at 20x the distance to Uranus. Uranus has a 20 AU orbital radius, so that puts the planet at a 400 AU distance. Voyager 1 is currently at a distance of about 135 AU out, and traveling at about 17 km/s. To travel another 265 AU at this rate, it will arrive at the planet's predicted orbital radius in 74 years. </p>
<p>Of course, given the incredibly long orbital period of the hypothetical planet it is unlikely Voyager 1 will have anything to look at when it passes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, until we can find planet IX and figure out its orbit there's no use sending a probe there.  We would have to invent a faster way to get there first anyway.</p>
<p>As for Voyager (1 or 2), it is nowhere near its predicted orbit and has no means to get there as it would require far too much fuel.  Plus, Voyager has minimal power reserves left and is using what little it has to explore the interstellar regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean probes in general and not Voyager specifically...</p>
<p>The propulsion systems capable of the fastest available speeds today are ion propulsion, and top speeds are 90,000 m/s or <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/Ion_Propulsion1.html" target="_blank">over 200,000 mph</a> - much faster than Voyager or New Horizons.</p>
<p>However, ion propulsion is very low thrust, and would take <em>years</em> along the way to build up to that kind of speed.  If such a probe were traveling in a straight line between the Sun and the planet's hypothesized minimum distance from the Sun (perihelion), and traveling the entire distance at the maximum speed, it would still take over a decade just to fly by the planet.  And flying by the planet at maximum distance (aphelion), traveling in a straight line going top speed the whole way, would take about 65 years.</p>
<p>But as noted, it takes a long time for an ion drive to speed up, and an almost equally long time to slow down enough to be captured by the planet's gravity (since no one would want to spend decades waiting for just a brief flyby).  Also, trajectories are hardly straight lines, but long curves under the gravitational influence of the Sun and other planets, so the distances would be significantly longer than either perihelion or aphelion.</p>
<p>You're looking at several decades transit time at minimum, and well over a century at maximum.  The planet being inclined 30 degrees from the ecliptic doesn't help, since changing orbital planes is costly in fuel all by itself.</p>
<p>In addition to the plane change, it's not a simple scaling from other probes precisely because the probe has to speed up and slow down.  Going 90,000 m/s is way too fast even for something with that mass to directly capture it, so it would have to cut its speed drastically.</p>
<p>Optimistic, 20-80 years.  More realistic 30-110 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
