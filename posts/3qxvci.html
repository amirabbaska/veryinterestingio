Mistake #5: Letting food cool before putting it in the fridge
Why: Illness-causing bacteria can grow in perishable foods within two hours unless you refrigerate them
Solution: Refrigerate perishable foods within 2 hours (or within 1 hour if the temperature is over 90ËšF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On the other hand, if you have something like a big pot of soup, you can end up heating the food around it in the fridge because it'll be giving off heat for so long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a restaurant where food safety was highly stressed and taught. It is important to know that uncovered leftovers/lukewarm leftovers do not need to wait before going in the fridge.</p>
<p>When SHOULD you wait to COVER your leftovers before SEALING them in the fridge? If you have a soup or any other large amount of food that is hot enough to create a large amount of steam you need to let that cool without a top/seal. Placing a sealed vat of steaming hot soup/liquid in your fridge creates a insulating effect that can keep your sealed foods in the TDZ even if they are in the fridge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>bostonjerk and dwight are right: never let food sit in the danger zone (40-140F) for more than 2 hours. If there is a hot plate that you need to cool, it's best to cool it as quickly as possible. Divide the food up into shallow tupperwares, and then put them in the freezer to cool or put it on an ice bath for about 15 mins, then put it in the refrigerator. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
