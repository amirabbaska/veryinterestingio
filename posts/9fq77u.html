<p>Also, I understand that nuclear submarines can stay underwater for a long time, but even they do surface once in a while. My question is - why? Why do they have to do that? Can't they remain submerged during the entire mission? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A diesel engine needs a source of oxygen, to burn with the diesel to power the engine. They can't store enough oxygen for long term running. Indeed, most diesel subs only use the diesel engines when at the surface or at periscope depth, pulling air down to run the engine to power the craft and to charge batteries, and when submerged they run solely on battery power.</p>
<p>But nuclear subs can stay submerged for as long as they can keep the crew fed (and sane). They can generate water by desalination, oxygen by electrolysis of water, and the CO₂ is removed by scrubbers that are regenerated using heat - all driven by the power output of the reactor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear submarines can stay underwater for as long as they have food for the crew, a normal amount of rations is 90 days' worth.</p>
<p>Diesel subs need to come up every few days for air, since their engines burn oxygen.</p>
<p>Another reason to surface is for communications; you can't send radio signals when deep underwater, and penetrating radio using VLF (very low frequencies) still has a maximum depth of about 60 feet. without coming up to the surface you would't be able to receive orders or information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former submariner.  Theoretically, it’s only a matter of supplies and crew stress.  I was serving in the 80s when there was no commercial Internet, and entertainment was limited to books, video tapes, and magazines.  I can imagine that this lack of communication would create considerable stress for today’s crews.</p>
<p>I discount the whole fresh air argument I keep seeing pop up on this post.  The air onboard a sub can be maintained breathable for an indefinite period of time.  Think about the ISS.  It isn’t like they can dip that thing into the atmosphere every now and then.  As long as you have a source of O2 (electrolysis on a sub, shipments of LOX to the ISS), can scrub out the CO2. CO, and H2, and otherwise filter noxious fumes, you don’t need fresh air</p>
<p>Another consideration is that the US coast has a number of ‘submerged-free’ zones, particularly at major ports, where nothing should operate submerged.  If there is anything submerged in such zones, it’s assumed to be hostile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could theoretically stay under for about 3 months. Subs are specifically loaded with a &quot;90 day loadout&quot;. The longest I ever stayed under was 60ish days. </p>
<p>Depending on the mission they really should at least stick the snorkel mast up and change out the atmosphere. The HVAC system is very good but it just circulates farts over time. It's amazing the difference ventilating fresh air is after weeks of not doing so. </p>
<p>We make our own fresh water and oxygen but can't make our own food. After about day 10 or so the fresh fruit and veggies are gone so it's all canned and frozen stuff. Day 45ish and you're down to all canned mostly. Day 55 it's rough. Beanies and weenies every day almost</p>
