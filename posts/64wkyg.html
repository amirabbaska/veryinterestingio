		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version is their proposed drill sites are in the territorial waters of the US, Costa Rica, and Mexico.  So they need to get permission from whichever government controls the drill site they settle on.</p>
<p>The long is:</p>
<p>The earth is &quot;owned.&quot;  Every government owns (or controls who owns) all of the land directly underneath it.  Obviously this isn't infinite, the nature of the Earth being a sphere means that if you went down deep enough there would be overlapping claims, but present technology doesn't let us drill anywhere close to where that would become an issue. </p>
<p>Governments also own the ocean up to 200 miles off their shore, as well as the land underneath that ocean.  Once you get outside of that 200 mile zone you are in international waters.  Here things start to get unclear.  </p>
<p>Most of the world has agreed to a treaty known as the Law of the Sea Convention.  That convention sets up how things are to function within the 200 mile limit, and created a commission known as the International Seabed Authority (ISA) that is supposed to determine when entities are allowed to conduct undersea drilling in international waters.</p>
<p>The problem here is that the US has agreed to everything in the  Law of the Sea Convention <em>except</em> the provisions creating the ISA.  Since the US doesn't recognize the ISA and the US effectively controls most of the Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans the ISA has very little authority.</p>
<p>As of right now this isn't a problem, because the technology does not exist to drill in international waters and so far the ISA's activities have been limited to authorizing a handful of deep sea surveys that went nowhere.</p>
<p>As to the Japanese company in question - they have 3 proposed drill sites, all of which are within the territorial waters of the US, Costa Rica, or Mexico.  So the answer is simple.  They have to secure permission to drill from the government that controls whatever site they eventually decide to drill at.  </p>
<p>If they were drilling on the land, they would need to comply with whatever regulations were applicable to such drilling in the country where it was being carried out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The rules for individuals who own land vary by country. In some countries, a land owner owns all the way down. In other countries, underground oil, mineral, and water rights may be owned by the state. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a dangerous endeavour. The boundary between the crust and the mantle is known as the Mohorovicic discontinuity, which I believe marks a change in rock density. Reaching it could be quite explosive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
