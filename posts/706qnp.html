		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question in full. But what I do know is that we regularly create ASD type symptoms in animals for testing/research purposes. So broadly, yes, artificially altered animals can exhibit signs of autism. If you are asking if it is observed to occur naturally, then I am unsure. As a neurologist I can see no reason why not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question and well-worded. Had you asked &quot;do animals get autism&quot; there would be no way to answer because an autism diagnosis must be based on human frame of reference. That seems obvious, but it's key to recognize there can never be an autistic animal. As soon as the symptoms leave human context, it's not really autism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2814%2900824-1#.WbvqchynSSs.google_plusone_share" target="_blank">This</a> is a good reference from one of the leaders in the field of autism research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are many biological steps between genes and behavioral outputs; moreover, the social and environmental contexts that shaped human behavior compared with that of rodents have been highly divergent over the course of evolutionary time. Thus, behaviors resulting from mutations introduced into the mouse genome might best be construed as no more than potentially useful readouts of underlying neural processes. Drugs act on molecular targets, not directly on behaviors or other symptoms. Thus, predictive validity for therapies requires good conservation of the molecular mechanism by which activation or inhibition of a molecular target affects a well-chosen readout that correlates strongly with a human symptom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hallmarks of autism are 1) social disorder and 2) stereotyped behavior. Obviously this super broad and you could fit just about any average user into the autism box with this diagnosis. It's up to the doctor to make the call about whether the behavior is pathological. </p>
<p>It's even more difficult with animals in nature because we can't really monitor their social interactions the same way as with people. Sure, with monkeys we can measure eye contact or watch for things like over-grooming, but we could never know if these are because of &quot;autism&quot; or he/she just doesn't like the perfume you're wearing and it makes him/her itchy. </p>
<p>Studying autism in research is a different story. We can make animals with a genetic mutation that copies a mutation found in human autistic patients. If we see a sudden change in animal behavior because if this mutation, we can be pretty sure there is some overlapping biology being screwed up common between the patient and the animal. </p>
<p>TLDR: Yes</p>
