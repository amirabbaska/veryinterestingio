		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your lips lacks sebaceous glands, which means unlike most of your skin it can't keep itself lubricated with natural oils.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> Sebaceous glands are the little oil producing 'pouches' that are at the base of each individual hair inside the hair follicle. The oil comes out of your pores and is there to keep your hair and skin lubricated, conditioned, pliable, and healthy. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> Several folks have brought up fordyce spots. These <em>are</em> a sort of sebaceous gland associated with the lips, but they're only along the edge of the lips, or what is known as the &quot;vermilion border&quot; (these harmless spots are also found on the penis, scrotum, and labia). I am not a doctor but it doesn't seem like they're <em>as</em> well equipped to keep lips from chapping in many conditions, and the enzymes from our own saliva can override any benefit they may try to contribute if you lick your lips too much. The rest of the lips are high and dry, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong> Some fellas with beards have mentioned not having as much trouble with chapped lips since growing said beard. I'd never even considered this until now (girl here, can't beard) but I would believe that the oils from your beard would make it to your lips and keep them moisturized and happy. </p>
<p>Good discussion, everyone! And thanks for keeping me fact-checking. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The external covering of your lips is essentially a thin layer of skin. Like all skin, it can get dry. Poor hydration, sun exposure, and cold weather can all dry out and irritate your skin, lips included. When you lick your lips, you're rubbing your tongue over that skin and wearing it down through contact and saliva. Do that repeatedly, and your lips will dry out even more since saliva is not moisturizing, but rather is full of enzymes meant to break down food. Stay hydrated and keep chapstick on hand to prevent chapped lips and stay comfortable! :)</p>
<p>EDIT: I realize I made it sound as if saliva can break down skin. It can't. My point was more to note that saliva's purpose is not skin moisturization, but something else entirely. When you lick your lips, you make them wet, but it evaporates quickly. Through evaporation, even more moisture is pulled out of your lips. Don't lick your lips!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: why do (most) chapstick brands create a dependency that results in my lips becoming even more disgustingly chapped than they were before? I have not tried all brands, but I haven't ever had a brand that didn't cause this problem. Currently I use Aquaphor with varying results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lips get chapped when they become dehydrated, or sun burnt, or go through too many hot/cold cycles (anecdotal). As has been noted, licking your lips exacerbates the problem, while a good lip balm helps a great deal. What has not been noted yet, that I have seen, is that a diet high in omega-3 containing fish, or omega 3/fish oil supplements seem to help a noticeably when taken in sufficient quantity - at least 1200mg per day. </p>
<p>I have always had a problem with chapped lips during the winter, but over the past year, I've been very regular in using omega 3 supplements, and my lips have, thus far, done wonderfully during this winter season. Gone from using lip balm 2-3x a day in past winters to less than once a week this winter. Worth a try and tons of other health benefits too! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your lips is thin and sensitive. It prone to drying out when you're dehydrated or when it's licked. The reason licking your lips causes chapping is because your saliva contains digestive enzymes that are designed to break down food and the acidity of saliva can really dry out your lips over time (I chronically lip my lips and I always have dry lips!).</p>
<p>The best way to make sure your lips aren't dry is by drinking plenty of water, moisturizing them, either with a lip balm or something like coconut oil, and stop licking them!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> You well-researched bitches making me look dumb, STOP IT! I now understand that saliva isn't acidic! I just assumed it was because of the digestive enzymes, I made the assumption it was acidic.</p>
<p>The more ya know, I guess! Thanks for commenting. :*</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
