		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to find the lowest temperature fire can be. Like the actual flame, not the ignition point or anything like that. On earth, not on earth, however. The more answers the better. I started asking my HS science teachers in 1992, asked every science professor I've had. Never got an answer.  Thank you!</p>
<p>Edit:  Going to edit to clarify my intentions:  14 year old me, sophomore in HS, was bored one day, and wondered if there was a fire cold enough I could hold it, touch it, be engulfed in it, without being harmed.  /u/legalizegaypot hit the nail on the head with his expanding of the question.  Now, while I love the theoretical discussions, my original intention was to find the coldest fire that could be produced from known materials.  I hope this helps to clarify my intentions, but damn, I'm loving the theoretical discussions right now.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a tough question to answer, even having studied combustion for a few years in a graduate environment.  I would define a flame to be a reaction which is propogated by a 2-d front within the fluid volume (not on a solid boundary).  That is to say, the reaction is better represented by a 2d surface rather than a 3d volume.  The reaction front can then be pushed around by the local fluid velocity.  If you use this definition to determine the minimum possible flame temperature, you'd possibly look for two gasses (possibly liquids) which ignite on contact with each other, and release very little heat.  I'm not a chemist, but I will say that finding such a combination would be difficult as reaction speed typically increases with energy being released.</p>
<p>This leads to a second point: Combustion reactions (and therefore flames) also are characterized by a fairly large activation energy in comparison to their heat release (which is also typically large).  This means that they depend on the heat release of their products to ignite new reaction.  Again, I'm not a chemist, but to get to a super low flame temp, you'd have to investigate a wide variety of reactions here.  I'd start by looking at reactions with the lowest possible autoignition temperature, and then cool them way below that so that their reaction gets them a few degrees above the autoignition temp.  A diluent would maybe have to be added to get the temperature down.  And the final temp would have to be sufficiently high that the reaction region is still thin (milimeters) enough to be considered a flame.  A good place to start would be exotic fluorine molecules with autoignition Temps way below 0C.</p>
<p>Again this is a very open ended question and depends heavily on the chemistry involved, but I wanted to clear, up a lot of the misinformation floating around here about what a flame actually is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you are defining a, &quot;flame.&quot; Are you looking for a chemical reaction that is consuming a fuel and emitting light and heat? Are you defining it as something that must consume a certain type of fuel (presumably oxygen?), or can light be the source of energy? Also temperature is an average of heat, so it really then depends on volume as well. </p>
<p>I think the simplest answer to your question would be, very very cold. You could consult the literature and try to find ultra-low temperature chemical reactions that emit light. It would take some time though... </p>
