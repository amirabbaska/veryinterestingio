		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they all are randomly out of tune, but just slightly, so they add up around the proper notes.</p>
<p>On average you get a sound that is more intense around the right notes and their harmonics (which makes it sound non-dissonant), and the out of tune sounds just becomes a bunch of overtones making the sound a richer and more complex timbre.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's sometimes called &quot;detuning&quot;, used in music recording when a whole bank of synthesizers are all tuned slightly differently, producing a very &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; waveform.</p>
<p>Very similar is the difference between a solo violin and an orchestra full of them.  Love the latter, not a fan of the former.  In a group of violinists, each will be playing a slightly different tone, but they'll average out to the right one, so that's the one we hear.</p>
<p>When a solo violinist is a little off key (which they often are), it's easy to hear and unpleasant to the trained ear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possible explanation is that engaging in coordinated behavior such as singing or chanting significantly changes perception of self and others, creating a sense of identity that is corporate rather than individual.  </p>
<p>&quot;...the auditory suppression that commonly accompanies speech production is absent during synchronous speech with a live person, and hypothesize that this may alter the subjective experience of self versus other when participating in unison speech.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These cortical activations may correlate with a change in the locus of control of the interaction: when people coordinate their actions, they minimize movement degrees of freedom by becoming part of a self-organizing system with the locus of control “outside” either individual...&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason that a choir can sound fuller than a soloist, or an orchestra can sound fuller than a single instrument. It is very difficult for multiple singers or instruments to be perfectly in pitch with each other all the time. These slightly detuned pitches get averaged together when we hear them and this leads to a thick and full sound. </p>
<p>We can produce this artificially by doing the same thing, take a tone and split it into several tones each slightly detuned from the others and we call this a chorus effect. The sound of 1980's pop guitars was heavily influenced by this. </p>
<p>However, when there is just one tone that is out of tune, this causes 'beating' which is when the sound waves sync up in an irregular pattern and it sounds harsh. </p>
<p>When two tones are in tune, they either sound at the same frequency, or at perfect divisions of that frequency. For instance 440hz and 880hz sound good together because the 880 vibrates exactly twice for every vibration of the 440. It adds up. </p>
<p>But 440hz and 450hz do not perfectly match up, and so it causes the sound to fluctuate unharmonically leading to beating. </p>
<p>To put it another way, music is math that we can hear. Chords are fractions and if the fractions divide evenly, it sounds good. If the fractions do not divide evenly, it sounds bad. When you hear about people comparing music to math, this is what they are talking about. Each note has a numeric value in hertz, and chords are formed by taking a root note or root tone in hz and producing complimentary tones that divide well with that root note. Notes that do not divide well will produce chaotic waves that break up the simplicity of the root tone instead of re-inforcing it and we find this displeasing. So music sounds good because math. ;) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
