		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HOLY CRAP! A question from my industry!  Yes, i worked the first FOUR years of my engineering career at a factory in rural America that produced approximately 2 million pounds of unsliced turkey deli meat per week.  I still work for one of the largest producer of turkey in the world.  The answer almost exclusively boils down to economics.  Turkey is a lower cost protein to make than chicken (by a small margin...but feed inputs are roughly 70% of the cost of poultry and turkeys are more efficient feed converters.  Every little bit counts here).  On top of this turkey is incredibly seasonal.  Thanksgiving, christmas, and to a lesser extent easter are when turkey producers make their money and spend the rest of the year trying not to lose it.  You cant just turn on the giant industro-ag machine that is turkey production for three holidays so production must remain relatively stable year round.  People dont buy whole turkeys throughout the year so producers have to get creative.  Enter turkey bacon, burgers, and.....deli breast!  Essentially...if you want reasonably priced thanksgiving and christmas turkeys...the industry has to find creative ways to sell it year round....the white goes to deli, dark goes to ham, bacon, and burgers.  If you have any other questions i would be happy to answer! Poultry is my life! Currently working at a large cooked chicken plant (edited to remove a customer reference...don't want to get make anyone mad...i can't/won't be able to answer questions about specific customers or products)
Edit to add a few other economic factors...turkey takes substantially longer to grow than chicken so contracts on pricing are easier to secure.  Chicken grows in weeks...so your contract price might look great the first flock...but feed prices change rapidly and if you lock in a year contract on chicken you could be getting screwed.  Also, there are higher margin outlets for chicken breast than deli meat.  Restaurants dont want to serve turkey because its slow to cook...chicken is fast and with high margins...chicken breasts are incredibly popular at the meat case for grilling.  If you can get it in your store, buy a raw turkey tenderloin to marinate and grill! Best cut of meat to grill bar a ribeye!
Edit a second time to say thanks for the gold.  If you have questions keep asking and i'll answer ALL OF THEM.  NOW GO OUT THERE AND ORDER SOME TURKEY! Im headed out for a bit but keep asking.  Ill answer all the questions you send me.<br />
FINAL EDIT GUYS: My fingers hurt and i need some cold cut turkey to rejuvenate.  some people are getting pretty close to figuring out my identity so i've disclosed to much and am gonna stop answering questions.  i am not a &quot;heartless animal killing nazi&quot; but i do have a family to feed and a great job i wanna keep!  For the vegans/vegetarians out there i know i won't change your opinions but know we are doing the most humane and respectful processes we can.  i feed this stuff to my family and eat it almost every day.    if you have any turkey specific questions let me know in my private messages and i'll be glad to answer them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i work in a grocery store beside the deli counter - let me explain.</p>
<p>Mostly it's the illusion.  And the fact that turkeys only sell a few times a year (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas), so the industry needed to find a way to market turkey meat year round.</p>
<p>As for the illusion part - that is because nobody really expects to see slicked chicken since a chicken is small and they think that people are actually slicing a chicken breast.  </p>
<p>When you get sliced turkey (from a deli for example) you are not getting an actual sliced turkey breast either.  The meat arrives in a ball to the store, its mostly preformed meat with a little bit of binding agent (corn starch or something, I don't really know) and a whole lot of water.  The person who is going to slice it has to drain a lot of water - the water is great for adding weight and you pay by weight often.  </p>
<p>The big ball of meat is easy to slice and that is what they used to make sliced turkey from - which is a lot easier for people to believe than a sliced chicken breast I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a Deli in Australia many years ago (here Deli's just sell cold meats, olives, sliced cheeses, etc).</p>
<p>I would say that Ham was the most popular product by far. There were at least 8 types of ham, with varying degrees of processing - with 'off-the-bone' being the least processed, and most expensive. 'Champagne' ham was just a ball of pink with a ham-like skin. Once sliced they all looked roughly the same.</p>
<p>Turkey meat was a niche, and the 2 types you would get here were; processed, or breast meat - which again appeared similar once sliced, but tasted completely different.</p>
<p>There was also sliced processed chicken meat, which is mainly for kids and disgusting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turkey has less fat than chicken, and during the &quot;fat is evil&quot; era of the 1990s, this health aspect gave turkey a big boost, especially with all the ad campaigns reminding people of that fact. </p>
<p>To this day a lot of people still think that turkey is the healthy alternative to lunch meats like ham and roast beef.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
