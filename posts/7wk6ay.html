		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has signals that tell you if you need to be eating or not.  What most people consider &quot;hungry&quot; is your body saying &quot;hey, I've pretty much completed pulling all the stuff I can out of the last things you've eaten. If you don't put more in, I'll start working on stored goodies.&quot; (i.e., Fat/Muscle)  If you don't feed yourself in a short amount of time, it turns off the hunger signal, and says &quot;ok, gotcha, onto the stored goodies&quot; and suddenly you're not hungry anymore.  </p>
<p>Then there's really hungry. This is your body saying &quot;no man, you really gotta put something in me. I've already spent some time working on the stored goodies, I need external food! Like, now, man!&quot;</p>
<p>Most first world people rarely ever go long enough to feel the second one. Mainly when it happens is when we skip breakfast, get to work, and end up skipping lunch because we're too busy, even tho &quot;eh, I could eat, I'm a bit hungry&quot;. By the time late dinnertime rolls around, you're saying to yourself &quot;man, I could eat a horse! I'm starving!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because hunger comes in waves, which is signaled by the hormone called Ghrelin. And contrary to popular belief, these waves diminish in magnitude overtime. Meaning if you get a hunger spike at 5 pm, you'll get another one a few hours later, but it won't be as strong as the first one.</p>
<p>To your question though, it's just because of the wave-structure of hunger signaling. This is why fasting is far easier than you'd think. You  don't experience the sensation of hunger 100% of the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you wake up, your body gives you a sort of hormone rush to make you not feel hungry for a few hours or so. It’s why so many skip breakfast. Evolutionarily it gives you time to go find/catch your food by giving you the energy you need. Otherwise you’d wake up starving and not be able to efficiently hunt or gather </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically your body switches into recovery mode, which doesn't need much energy, as it only needs to take care of nonessential functions. Your brain function reduces, heart rate slows, etc. Most importantly, the triggers that make you feel hungry (amongst many other things!) are also reduced in effectiveness, as hunger is controlled by a system not essential for sleep </p>
<p>As such when you wake up it takes some time for your body to get back to its waking state, which being much more intensive, induces hunger again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach releases a chemical called ghrelin to your brain at certain intervals signaling hunger. If you wait these out the hunger subsides.  In fact, during a fast your stomach's production of ghrelin drops significantly, so that after the first three days or so you feel much less hungry during the ghrelin release periods.</p>
