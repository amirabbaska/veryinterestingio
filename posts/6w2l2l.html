		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One problem with the question is that pain research often tosses &quot;perception of potentially harmful stimuli&quot; in the same pot as &quot;suffering&quot;. </p>
<p>Many very simple organisms have ways to perceive and react to things that might hurt them. A bee doesn't like to be squeezed and will sting in defense if it gets too bad. A simple coral will notice touch and withdraw from it. Even plants react to damage.</p>
<p>What they don't have is the higher capacity to think and worry about those experiences. It happens, seems to be uncomfortable, the animal tries to get out of the situation, but they don't seem to develop a lasting &quot;fear&quot; or often even just a strategy to avoid the same situation from happening again. </p>
<p>A big part of what turns pain into suffering is the brain's ability to simulate the future. We can expect that something will hurt, we can fear it, we can imagine how bad things could get. We worry. Simple animals don't.</p>
<p>Context matters a lot to humans. The pain after a good workout can feel good, while the same amount of pain after an accident can have us suffering. It's very difficult to test for such processes in animals. You can check their bodies for special pain transmitting nerves, or chemical changes to damage, but that doesn't say anything about their ability to interpret the sensation beyond reflexes to move away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an abstract from an actual study. Invertebrates probably feel pain. </p>
<p>Nociception or pain in a decapod crustacean? Barr 2008. Animal Behavior. </p>
<p>Nociception is the ability to perceive a noxious stimulus and react in a reflexive manner and occurs across a wide range of taxa. However, the ability to experience the associated aversive sensation and feeling, known as pain, is not widely accepted to occur in nonvertebrates. We examined the responses of a decapod crustacean, the prawn, Palaemon elegans, to different noxious stimuli applied to one antenna to assess reflex responses (nociception) and longer-term, specifically directed behavioural responses that might indicate pain. We also examined the effects of benzocaine, a local anaesthetic, on these responses. Noxious stimuli elicited an immediate reflex tail flick response, followed by two prolonged activities, grooming of the antenna and rubbing of the antenna against the side of the tank, with both activities directed specifically at the treated antenna. These responses were inhibited by benzocaine; however, benzocaine did not alter general swimming activity and thus the decline in grooming and rubbing is not due to general anaesthesia. Mechanical stimulation by pinching also resulted in prolonged rubbing, but this was not inhibited by benzocaine. These results indicate an awareness of the location of the noxious stimuli, and the prolonged complex responses indicate a central involvement in their organization. The inhibition by a local anaesthetic is similar to observations on vertebrates and is consistent with the idea that these crustaceans can experience pain.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: However, another group could not replicate these findings, for whatever reason. </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Nociception is the physiological detection of noxious stimuli. Because of its obvious importance, nociception is expected to be widespread across animal taxa and to trigger robust behaviours reliably. Nociception in invertebrates, such as crustaceans, is poorly studied.</p>
<p>Methodology/Principal Findings</p>
<p>Three decapod crustacean species were tested for nociceptive behaviour: Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus), and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.). Applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae caused no change in behaviour in the three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the stimulated antenna, and there was no difference in movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in P. clarkii revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of concentrated sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>Conclusions/Significance</p>
<p>Previously reported responses to extreme pH are either not consistently evoked across species or were mischaracterized as nociception. There was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting topic. </p>
<p>The current theory is that there is a correlation between complex and non complex organisms and the interpretations of pain. More complex organisms feel pain similar to humans. </p>
<p>For example vertebrates, like a dog or human, are more complex then a spider or bumble bee. </p>
<p>An experiment took place with two groups of bees. One group had their leg pinched, simulating their leg being cut off, while the other group had nothing done to their legs. Two solutions of surcrose were also placed near the bees. One mixed with morphine and one mixed without.
In theory, the bees that had the pinched leg should be drawn to the morphine solution. However, this was not the case. The &quot;hurt&quot; bees did not consume more morphine than the control group, thus showing that less complex organisms do not react to pain the same way that humans do. The &quot;hurt&quot; bees did consume more of the normal surcrose and the morphine mixed surcrose so they were prone to some type of hyperactivity. Whether or not they feel the pain and experience the same things, we do not know. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: No. but they still feel something. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we can say: Pain is sensory information. From species to species, the more variance you have, the greater difference you have in sensory information. Additionally, the less complex the nervous system, the less potential there is for sensory information. </p>
<p>We know that insects are very different from mammals, and we know their nervous systems are far simpler. These two facts alone can tell us the answer is &quot;probably not.&quot; They often do display the fight or flight reaction with things we would consider painful, however, so they must experience it on some level. </p>
<p>Any further detail can get very difficult. Comparing pain in one human to pain in another human is already very complicated. You can end up in an annoying  philosophical debate comparing sensory experience between any two beings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would recommend reading &quot;Consider the Lobster&quot; by David Foster Wallace. Basically goes into the human reasoning that the idea of something having a different experience of pain means that we can not objectify what kind of pain that is and immediately assume that because of this, it is probably not as bad as our experience of pain. Even though we have no reason or evidence to back this up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
