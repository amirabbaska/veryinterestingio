<p>Meteors start really fast and then get slowed down by the atmosphere with all it's wind resistance. That wind resistance causes heat that burns them up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heating is caused by compression of gas. You probably know that if you compress gas it heats up. Objects entering our atmosphere from space tend to do so at tremendous velocities, so they hit the air hard, and squash a lot of it in front of them. This air gets very hot and in turn heats up the object. Even stuff in orbit tends to be moving <em>very</em> fast (otherwise it would crash into the ground), and this means when it hits the air, it smashes a lot of air into a small space, and that air becomes very hot and heats the object.</p>
<p>A space ship is designed, as others have noted, aerodynamically, so that less air gets squashed in front of it. Additionally, they generally take the shortest route possible through the majority of the atmosphere, so there is less time spent with a significant volume of air in front of them to squash, and during that time they are coming from a stop, so their speed is lower than a reentering body. Once a ship is in orbit it doesn't come to a stop with respect to the atmosphere, but in fact must accelerate to a significant velocity in order to &quot;stay up.&quot; Otherwise it would simply fall back to the ground. Next time it hits the atmosphere, it will be with a significant portion of that tremendous speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number of factors:
Speed of leaving the atmosphere is much lower than a meteor which can reach speeds of almost 300,000 kph, compare that to a rocket, around 30,000 kph, so the forces tearing at the spaceship are much lower.
Space shuttles have material very resistant to heat damage on different parts of the space craft, like silica tiles (basically a quartz composite). Some crafts even have a plastic coating that melts away pulling the heat energy away from the craft.
There is also a layer of insulation under the outer layer to protect the inside.
Upon reentry, things get a little more complicated. Shuttles have to come in at the perfect angle (around 40Ëš) too flat and they can bounce off the atmosphere back into space, too sharp and they risk burning up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So the meteor is fastest when the atmosphere is thickest, but rockets are fastest when the atmosphere is thinnest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
