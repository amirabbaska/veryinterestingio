		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any really large explosion that generates a large amount of hot gas will generate a mushroom cloud.  As the heated gas rises up, the outer edges are slowed down by drag and are pushed aside by the hot gas coming up behind them, creating a mushroom-like appearance.</p>
<p>It's an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability#Late-time_behaviour" target="_blank">Rayleigh-Taylor instability</a>.</p>
<p>If you detonated a nuclear weapon in zero-g, you wouldn't get that effect.  Or if the atmosphere were already the temperature of the nuclear fireball, since that would remove the buoyancy that causes that gas to rise.</p>
<p>Regular explosions will definitely do the same thing.  Source: when I was 14 and set a pile of wet leaves on fire with 3 gallons of gasoline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a result of sudden density changes. The sudden explosion and release of a large amount of hot gas which is less dense the air surrounding it rises into the atmosphere. Eventually, it gets to a point in the atmosphere that allows it to cool back to the density of the surrounding air and thus eventually falls. This causes the flattening and therefore the mushroom shape of the cloud.</p>
<p>You can demonstrate mushroom cloud formation by simply adding gases or liquids with different densities (and color for identification) together. For example, placing hot colored water in a cup with a hole on the bottom edge and then placing the cup in a larger cup of cold water. You will see a figure reminiscent of a mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the last two questions, but the shape may be spherical in space since there isn't an atmosphere of air surrounding the bomb anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it will. But they have to be pretty big. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqd9VjogPM" target="_blank">Here is a video of an ammunition dump exploding in Syria</a> which, if you ffwd to 00:39 you'll see the explosion and then a mushroom cloud forming. But even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_Massive_Ordnance_Air_Blast" target="_blank">GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast</a>, the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT is not large enough to form one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9H50tHiHjs" target="_blank">Here is a video of MOAB</a> and the test firing is near the start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brief:</p>
<p>The mushroom effect is not unique to nuclear explosions.</p>
<p>Superheated gasses from ground zero rises upward in a column because hot air is lighter than cold air.</p>
<p>As the hot gasses cool off they are pushed out of the blast column by hotter gas beneath. Now cool, the gas that rose (and the ash it carries with it) descend, but may be pulled back into the column due to the vacuum effect by other rising has still in the column.</p>
<p>The continual flow up from beneath and outward then back down and in again looks like a mushroom from the ground.</p>
<p>But from above it looks more like a sock being rolled inside out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
