<hr />
<p>So here is my understanding of the double slit experiment:</p>
<p>1) Fire a &quot;quantumn&quot; particle, such as an electron, through a double slit.</p>
<p>2) Expect it to act like a particle and create a double band pattern, but instead acts like a wave and causes multiple bands of an interference pattern.</p>
<p>3) &quot;Observe&quot; which slit the particle passes through by firing the electrons one at a time. Notice that the <strong>double band pattern returns, indicating a particle again.</strong></p>
<p>4) Suspect that the observation method is causing the electron to behave differently, so you now let the observation method still interact with the electrons, but do not measure which slit it goes through. Even though the physical interactions are the same for the electron, it now <strong>reverts to behaving like a wave with an interference pattern.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>My two questions are:</p>
<p><strong>Is my basic understanding of this experiment correct?</strong> (Sources would be nice if I'm wrong.)</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p><strong>HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE AND HOW DOES IT WORK? It's insane!</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're close but a little bit off:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you fire a bunch of electrons one-at-a-time (like your point #3), but you make no effort to figure out which slit they went through, you will see the interference pattern start to form</li>
<li>The only way you get the double-band is if you try to &quot;measure&quot; which slit the electrons went through, even retroactively (IE you measure them <em>after</em> they would have already passed through the slit)</li>
<li>What's even more mind-blowing is the idea of what-they-call &quot;Delayed-Choice Quantum Erasure&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a quick explanation of Delayed-Choice Quantum Erasure:</p>
<p>So let's say you fire photons one-at-a-time through the slits at some sensors. You get wave interference pattern because you're not trying to determine which slit they went through.</p>
<p>So you add polarized filters <em>after</em> the slits. Now you can tell which slit the photon went through based on whether it has up-down or left-right polarization. Well now your sensors will only detect particles. Cool so far, right? But maybe the polarization itself messed up the wave behavior, right?</p>
<p>Here's where it gets weird... If you &quot;forget&quot; the information about which slit it went through, it goes back to being a wave again! So in the above example, you place another filter in each path that &quot;scrambles&quot; the light polarization again. Now the double-band turns back into a wave, because you once-again have no way of knowing which slit it went through.</p>
<p>And it works even for huge distances! So it's like the universe is somehow able to know that you will <em>eventually</em> be able to determine which slit it went through, and so it collapses to a particle. But if it knows that you will <em>eventually</em> &quot;forget&quot; that information, it stays as a wave.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You missed the crucial point!</p>
<p>Even if you fire one electron at a time, you still get the multiple-band interference pattern: Each single electron will produce a single point on the screen, but after you have fired many electrons, one after the other, all the points together form the wave pattern. The fact that each electron forms one point shows you that they are particles, i.e., very small objects that are at a specific location in space.</p>
<p>However, the spacing of the wave pattern depends on the distance between the two slits. So, how can a single electron &quot;know&quot; that distance? As a small particle, it cannot &quot;see&quot; or &quot;feel&quot; the other, far away slit, when it went through one slit. Clearly, the electron has &quot;spread out&quot;, filling the whole space, hence &quot;sensing&quot; both slits, and &quot;interfering with itself&quot;. This shows you that the electron has passed through the slits as wave, i.e., as a spread-out entity which is not at all at one single specific location in space.</p>
<p>Only when reaching the screen, and thus getting &quot;observed&quot;, the electron wave &quot;collapses&quot; to a single point that lights up on the screen.</p>
<p>If you only look at the case of many electrons fired at the same time, you might argue that some electrons went through one slit, some through the other, afterwards they met, affected each others flight path, and thus somehow produced the specific interference pattern with it curious dependence on the distance of the slits. But once you notice that the same happens with only one single electron present at a time, you can no longer deny that it is really both a wave and a particle, both everywhere and yet a single point-like thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically a photon is used rather than an electron, since that makes figuring out the wavelength (which determines the pattern) a lot easier, but otherwise you got it right. </p>
<p>As far as why it works that way, we have no idea. Well, we have lots of ideas, but no solid answers. </p>
<p>We do know that if you split a photon into two entangled photons (each with half the energy) you can observe effects that appear to violate causality, in that measuring one particle <strong><em>after</em></strong> the other has gone through a double slit experiment changes the result of the experiment retroactively. Unfortunately it does so in a way that makes it useless for sending messages to the past. </p>
<p>When someone figures it out that's pretty much a guaranteed Nobel prize. </p>

<li>
<p>Yes, but your concept of observe is incomplete.  Firing an electron one-at-a-time doesn't really help you know where the electron went.  To observe which slit an electron went through, you'd shine a light just behind the slits, and the electron would collide with a photon which is detectable.  </p>
</li>
<li>Nobody knows, we just have theories.  This is one of those things that, if it doesn't blow your mind, you don't really understand it.  The way I tend to think of it is that they travel as probability waves, and events can occur which cause them to collapse back into a single point again.  Then they'll travel as a probability wave again.  Probability waves can interact with themselves and each other, hence the interference pattern when it passes through two slits.  So when an electron interacts with a photon in the case of us &quot;observing&quot; them, they collapse into a point, then go back to traveling as a new probability wave from that point.  So if you cause them to collapse back to a point on the other side of the slits, then you lose the interference pattern caused by the slits.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that in my internal idea of what's going on, the speed of light or the direction of time is being violated.  The entire wave of probabilities collapses at once, no matter how large it is.  So either it happens at infinite velocity, or something is going backwards in time and removing the rest of the probability wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
