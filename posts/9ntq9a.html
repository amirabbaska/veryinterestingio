If you were to let a drop of water go every few seconds, above a level surface, each drop would hit the surface and “break” (or disperse, dunno what the right word would be).</p>
<p>But, if you drop the water on a slanted surface, it sometimes bounces off that surface and goes in a different direction. Can anyone explain why this happens?</p>
<p>Also, I hope this applies to Chemistry. Feel free to let me know if it doesn’t.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's sort of in-between chemistry and physics.</p>
<p>A water drop contains many water molecules. These are holding together due to surface tension; they would much rather be surrounded by other water molecules than by air, so they try all try to &quot;squeeze&quot; into the ball. Surface tension isn't super strong (otherwise the water droplets would be much bigger), so they're juuuust managing to hold together.</p>
<p>When a drop of water hits a surface, don't think of it as a water drop, but rather as a collection of water molecules that are trying to hold hands. They all have slightly different movement vectors (different directions and speeds), and when they get abruptly stopped by the <strong>flat</strong> surface, they can't hold on to each other and scatter in all directions. If you have a <strong>slanted</strong> surface on the other hand, most of them will actually bounce the same direction, and therefore it's easier for them to hold on to each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine it in your head like a water balloon.  If you drop it from a high location to a flat surface, the balloon will explode on impact.  From lower heights, it'll bounce.</p>
<p>The bouncing comes from the balloon spreading out, stretching the rubber, and then the rubber snapping back together - as long as the strength of the rubber isn't exceeded causing an explosion.</p>
<p>Dropping it from a tall height onto an angle reduces the force of the impact, so it's more likely to bounce and not exceed the strength of the balloon.</p>
<p>The reason that water seems to stay together and not slough off random bits as it bounces in because the molecules getting shoved away the most - the ones on the outer rim - are still being held by the same tension and contributing to it.  You need a strong enough force to exceed that strength, or it'll all snap back together.  Either the whole thing explodes, or most all of it is going to keep holding together.  Basically, unless the balloon is stretched beyond the tearing threshold, it's all going to hold together.</p>
<p>This works as a pretty good first-order analogy because a water balloon is basically super-exaggerating the strength of the surface tension.  But surface tension is a factor of the surface area of the drop of liquid - and the force involved from a drop is dependent on the mass which scales with the volume.  If you scale up an object, the volume (and thus mass) will scale with the cube of the scaling factor, while the surface area only scales with the square. </p>
<p>So if I make a droplet 100x bigger, I've made the surface tension ~10,000 stronger but I've increased the force it needs to resist by a factor of 1,000,000.  I've altered the ratio between the two by a factor of 100.  So to make my larger system act similarly, I need to artificially increase the surface tension by a factor of ~100.  Hence a thin rubber water balloon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like the force on the flat surface overcomes the surface tension because there is nowhere else to go. On an angle the initial impact doesn't take all the force and the rest goes to the bounce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do bounce on a flat surface, but it looks different.</p>
<p>Rain drop can be divided into smaller unit still. When a slant is involved, most of these units want to bounce in the same direction and surface tension keeps them mostly together.</p>
<p>Without a slant, there's no prevailing direction for them to bounce and surface tension fails to keep the rain drop together.</p>
<p>If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will let me know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
