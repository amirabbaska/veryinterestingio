<p>What you're describing is temporary and I'm pretty sure it happens to everyone. I don't know what it's called, but it was explained to me like Feedback in a microphone.</p>
<p>Basically a sound loop in one ear that builds on itself until it swells into a high pitched ring. Eventually the noise cancels itself out and the ringing goes away.</p>
<p>It's only Tinnitus if you hear it all the time. Also, you can hear your own blood flow in really quiet places... but that's more of a low pitched hum and not a high pitched squeal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the inner ear cochlea structure are tiny hairs , the base of which connect to nerves. When sound enters the ear it ( after vibrating several other structures ) sets up vibration in fluid, which vibrates these tiny hairs allowing you to perceive sound . Sometimes the hairs stick together , making them fire the nerve, regardless of what sound is present . This can be caused by many things, but mostly exposure to loud and/or loud, sustained noise. Tinnitus is when it's a permanent condition, and ranges wildly from where it's there only if one pays attention , to cases where, supposedly people commit suicide because they can't stand it. Mine i s pretty bad, but I usually either don't notice or don't mind. I've had it since I was a teen listening to the Rolling Stones (primarily) on stereo headphones, so I could turn the volume UP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is how my ear doc explained it to me.  Due to inner ear damage from prolonged exposure to loud music or noises, the ear is damaged and there is hearing loss for certain frequencies.  The brain recognizes this hearing loss and &quot;invents&quot; these pitches to fill in the gaps.  This is why they say that sometimes having a white noise on can alleviate some of the ringing...because then the brain doesn't have to fill the silence with the sound..  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
