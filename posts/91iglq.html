		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a voluntary and an involuntary aspect to swallowing. Generally you start by pushing your tongue back, it triggers a cascade of reflex movements that close the nasal passage at the posterior end of the palate with the soft palate and close the trachea opening with the epiglottis.
Once the reflexes start, your body presumably disables the gag reflex as further sensation from the Vagus nerve in the area is unnecessary to complete the action of swallowing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gag reflex is a protective response of the body to prevent the passing of food, drink, or other substances from the oral cavity (the mouth) into the pharynx (the throat). The primary role of this reflex is to protect the airway from invasion, thus reducing the risk of aspiration or choking.</p>
<p>When we swallow, however, a different reflex is triggered: the swallow reflex. This occurs when the tongue voluntarily pushes food or drink (called a bolus) toward the back of the oral cavity. The bolus activates some combination of nerves in the back of the tongue, the pharyngeal arches, uvula, and posterior pharyngeal wall to initiate the swallow reflex, which enacts a series of involuntary muscle movements designed to close off the trachea (windpipe) and direct the bolus into the esophagus.</p>
<p>When swallowing foods and liquids the swallow reflex typically activates instead of the gag reflex, thus allowing people who have a gag reflex (about 1/3 of the population do not) to swallow easily. Some people have an atypically sensitive gag reflex that can preclude swallowing as it activates prior to the swallow reflex  when a bolus is propelled toward the back of the oral cavity. These people are treated by a team that often includes an otolaryngologist (ENT) and speech-language pathologist to minimize the sensitivity of the reflex to allow for more effective swallowing.</p>
<p>I would also like to clarify on some points I have seen so far in this thread. </p>
<p>First, the swallow reflex can still be activated even if the food is not sufficiently masticated (chewed) into small enough pieces to pass safely through the pharynx and esophagus. The gag reflex is designed to decrease the risk of this happening, but it is not always activated in these circumstances and (again) not all people have one.</p>
<p>Second, the larynx does not open up during the gag reflex. Instead, the vocal folds (vocal cords) close and often the aryepiglottic folds (false vocal cords) close as well. This protects the airway from invasion in case the gag reflex is not successful in clearing the material from the pharynx back into the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Third, the absence of the gag reflex has been shown to be associated with dysphagia (disordered swallowing) <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00455-017-9826-y" target="_blank">source</a>. However, the loss of a gag reflex is only one reason among many that increase a person's risk for dysphagia with advancing age. More common reasons speech-language pathologists see older individuals for dysphagia evaluation and treatment include: decreased muscle tone or control of the tongue, larynx, or pharynx; decreased pharyngeal or laryngeal sensation; anatomical changes (e.g. cancer, surgery); and changes in cognitive abilities. Many of these are secondary to diseases and conditions that become more likely with advanced age such as dementia and Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Edit: deleted &quot;overrides&quot; in favor of &quot;activates instead of&quot; in first sentence of third paragraph as a more accurate, clear description</p>
<p>Edit 2: 1st sentence - replaced &quot;designed&quot; with &quot;a protective response of the body&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reflexive pharyngeal swallow. It's a reflex closely related to the gag reflex but instead of pushing material out back to the mouth, it pushes material down toward the esophagus. The mechanism also forces closed the glottis, protecting the airway. Dysfunction in this reflex can lead to aspiration of material into the lungs. The stimulation caused by this reflex leads to a chain reaction resulting in a peristaltic wave down the esophagus, forcing the food bolus into the stomach. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
