		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is also very common in plants, somewhat due to their being less complex. If a human has one extra chromosome, it causes major problems because we are very complex and tiny changes can really mess things up. Plants being less complex are able to handle changes that come with extra chromosomes, and sometimes can even benefit from it. </p>
<p>Plants are able to hybridize and have extra ploidys for the same reason. Two similar plant species mating together can often have viable offspring while in the animal world, hybrids are rarer and often not viable like mules.</p>
<p>Extra ploidys happen by mistake in reproduction. A ploidy (n) is a set of chromosomes. Humans and animals are diploid (2n) meaning we have two sets one from each parent. A mistake in cell division in plant reproduction can cause plants to have different ploidys. Like triploid (3n) or more. Rice for example has twelve sets of chromosomes (12n). Since plants are less complicated and mobile, the extra sets of chromosomes are less harmful and can  randomly lead to extra benefits</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have *46 chromosomes.</p>
<p>And as many commenters have already pointed out: junk DNA. The sheer size of an organism's genome is not and indication of the organism's complexity. Polyploidy, or having more than 2 sets of chromosomes, is especially common in plants. Sometimes an aberration occurs causing the number of sets to change, most commonly a duplication, and BAM! - the genome is twice as large, without the organism's complexity being terribly affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We dont know concisely but genetics can explain a lot.</p>
<p>A fern isnt some ancient species, a relic kept through time. its a lifeform alive at the same time as you, and underwent the same genetic experiences as the same organisms that descended from /it/. The consensus is its &quot;junk DNA&quot;, however that doesnt at all encapsulate why this is and what those many chromosomes do, and anyone telling you just that is immensly googling and trying to sound high and mighty.</p>
<p>Ferns in particular were some of the early land plants, and these types of plants had weird things. Particularly in the difference of gamete synthesis and generational life stages. back in this time of the evolutionary tale plants would have a diploid stage and a haploid stage - imagine if sperm or eggs lived for a while as humans, and then got together made a diploid human (closest analagy i can think of bear with me). </p>
<p>Nobody knows exactly how it happened, but the genome of the fern has an issue during meiosis, and this happened throughout the past. For some reason the normal process keeps another set of chromosomes, and there needs to be more research as to how.</p>
<p>Where other organisms have selective pressure and undergo constant recombination and mutation to forward evolution under selection, the fern has not underwent much morphological change, but its genome has underwent the same rigor as the other genomes of life right now (albeit instead of descent, the fern kept it all).</p>
<p>Though DNA replication has a high fidelity and high retention, the process is very automatic. and when it comes to the generational setup of the fern in particular, the replication phase to create a gamete insures that any genetic information that did not bear fruitful during natural selection is still conserved; its mind blowing when you realize it, but a genome isnt everything that will be used to make everything, a lot of it is many repititve sequences and structural partitions, the most important part of the genome is arguably what is actually transcribed. </p>
<p>Ferns have a few genes they transcribe, and thats stuck. Because they started so early in the evolutionary timeframe their genetics is pretty stuck to transcribing pretty much what it needs and has needed for a while. This leads to an organism that has only a few genes, that will be transcribed to read /other/ genes, also few in number, and if you dont change the code on that first part of the transcription pathway, then its stuck on what actually gets read from the genome, no matter the size of it.</p>
<p>Everytime any sexual reproduction happens, the genome undergos small copies, flips, transformations and reversals. Because the fern never really changed what it transcribed from the genome, not only do you have an organism that looks damn near what it was, it never killed the fern over generations to keep so many of its copies and changes that expanded its genome. Its still kickin, and so you get an organism with a huge genetic library with such an &quot;archaeic&quot; morphology.</p>
<p>some organisms branched off from this, well actually MOST plants have some fern in them, but you can see now how this is a case of goldilocks finding it just right, genetically speaking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>ERVs also provide very interesting proof that humans and the great apes share a common ancestor. There are still many viruses in our DNA at locations where chimps and gorillas have them too. (Sorry Abrahamic religions)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
