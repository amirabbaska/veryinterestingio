	<title>After the recent eruption in Hawaii, it is clear to see how it affects life on land. My question now is how does it affect life in the ocean? Does the water in contact with the lava super heat it, killing off any organisms living close by?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, there's no &quot;after&quot; about it. The hype has slowed down but the volcano has not. Here is the <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/status.html" target="_blank">official status</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://bigislandnow.com/2018/06/08/6-am-clear-view-into-puu-oo/" target="_blank">recent news update</a> about the lava flow that is currently entering the ocean. Specifically, look at the following quote from the June 8, 6am update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strong thermal upwelling was noted in the ocean extending up to 1000 yards out to sea from the visible lava front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That may not sound like much but it is. It's enough that getting a boat that close is dangerous and trying to swim or scuba dive near the lava can easily kill you. Trying to do science in those conditions isn't easy.</p>
<p>Look at the Wikipedia definition for <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/status.html" target="_blank">laze</a>. Basically, it's the hot lava reacting with the ocean to create deadly acid. Not nice.</p>
<p>There are also things like giant steam explosions and large portions of newly formed lava collapsing and creating tsunamis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the water in contact with the lava super heat it, killing off any organisms living close by?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, of course. But it really depends on your definition of &quot;close by&quot;. I live on the other side of the island. Many tourists consider that so &quot;close by&quot; that they've cancelled their vacation plans even though the only real affect we feel is extra vog (overcast skies).</p>
<p>Look up Kapoho. Here's a good <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/06/us/hawaii-volcano-kapoho-bay/index.html" target="_blank">before/after</a> comparison. That was a gorgeous bay filled with all sorts of organisms. Now it is all under lava.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
