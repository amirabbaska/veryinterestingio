		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The solar system didn't emerge from a single larger star, rather it emerged from an ordinary molecular cloud, like any other star. The metals (heavy elements) originated from <strong>many</strong> star that went supernova and threw out their interior into interstellar space which mixed with the already existing gas clouds. </p>
<p>New stars can't form from single supernova remnants because the gas is both hot and expanding, while stellar formation needs gas cold enough to contract. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>heavier elements were seeded through the universe by supernova. Specifically by Population III stars and the large examples of Population II stars. </p>
<p>Supernova are unimaginably violent and energetic. The matter blown off by them from them isn't just flung out a little distance and then pulled back in, the shockwave is moving at thousands of kilometers per second. the Gravity of the solar system doesn't stand as chance. Given a bit of time, that matter gets spread and distributed over a very very large distance. </p>
<p>And then another star goes supernova. And then another. And then a few million more. And so on. Each of them flinging those heavier elements out into their galaxies/protogalaxies.</p>
<p>In the meantime star formation hasn't stopped.  In the heart of giant molecular clouds throughout the galaxy, hydrogen is happily collapsing into new protostars, except instead of mostly pure hydrogen with bit of helium and a very little bit of lithium those first stars have spread heavier elements into the mix. This actually accelerates star formation in those molecular clouds  since the higher density particles make it a bit easier for gravity to do it's thing. </p>
<p>A few billion years of supernovae and there's now quite a lot of heavier elements out there. Relatively speaking anyways. The build of hydrogen in whatever molecular cloud are sun formed in collapsed in this &quot;modern&quot; era of star formation. Hence why we're here sitting on sitting on a rock mostly made up of those heavier elements talking about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're making the mistake of thinking that the heavy elements had to come from a local star. In the early universe there was a huge abundance of hydrogen and as a result, many many giant stars that lived short violent lives. Coupled with the expansion of space, it wouldn't necessarily have to be a local star. </p>
<p>Also a good amount of the mass is converted into energy such as gamma rays and x rays. But the rest of the mass could be in a huge distance away from us, depending on the origin star(s). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been answered elsewhere in the thread, but elements heavier than iron are formed when a star goes supernova, not before.  Iron is the cutoff point because that's when the fusion process goes from exothermic (producing energy) to endothermic (requiring energy.)  But during a supernova, the star is producing plenty of energy to fuse elements into all sorts of heavier metals.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
