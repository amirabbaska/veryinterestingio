		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a stress response. </p>
<p>While it may not seem the same as how you feel when you're anxious about a test you think you just failed or nervous about a cop that just pulled out behind you, it's the same physiology. Like the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response" target="_blank">fight-or-flight scenario</a>, stress can cause your digestive tract, along with your appetite, to go into sleep mode.</p>
<p>The simplest way to think about stress responses like this is to take it to the extreme. If you were getting chased by a lion, the last thing your body needs to worry about is what's for lunch or digesting whatever you had for breakfast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you go through a major life change, your brain reacts to it. In this case there's a real (or at least perceived) loss. This may trigger a slight depression (note: not a depressive disorder or even a depressive episode, just regular ol' normal sadness). </p>
<p>As for losing your appetite, you're a little bit wrong on that. Different people will react in different ways to the same (or similar) situations. Some people, when sad/depressed will lose their appetite, whereas some people will eat <em>more</em>. The brain is weird like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Post break-up, if one's appetite and sleep patterns show a significant change, it's because of an episode of depression. </p>
<p>Depression is essentially the 'sickness syndrome' one faces due to emotional inducers. Sickness syndrome is what happens when you get sick, like the name suggests. It could be because of cold, fever or even cancer. A sickness is an active attack on your immune system, and your body starts shutting down certain functions slowly. One of the primary symptoms are the dulled down sensory organs- Sight, taste, touch, sound and smell. You will find depressive patients preferring darkness instead of light, because their eyes have literally become that sensitive to so much brightness, it can't register that amount of information as easily as a healthy person would. Similarly, your sense of taste becomes less efficient and food begins to taste bland. This is the cause for over-eating as well as loss of appetite. The over-eaters seek solace in the food that they are eating, and there are some food items, such as, chocolates which help with the increase in Serotonin which helps maintain a balance in hormones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I went completely in the opposite direction after my last breakup and put as much food and whiskey in myself as physically possible to the point where I would be really uncomfortably full.
