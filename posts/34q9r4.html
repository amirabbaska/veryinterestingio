		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just going to say, that having lived in a modern, first world city when a 6.3 mag EQ wrecked it shortly after a 7.1 stomped through (CHCH, NZ, 22/2/2011):</p>
<p>NYC is fucked.</p>
<p>With a cactus.</p>
<p>I'll try to show you your level of fuckedness, and I won't even have to fuck up any buildings.</p>
<p>NYC has pipes? Everything underground is now trashed. Sewerage, electricity, gas! Great, so now it's trashed and on fire. Better get some people moving! Oh, all your train lines are fucked. Ok, how about truck / car transport? No, I doubt a single one of your elevated freeways would handle the ~0.8g acceleration that bought down the Hanshin Expressway in Japan in a smaller earthquake.</p>
<p>You have no power.</p>
<p>You have no clean water.</p>
<p>You have no sanitation.</p>
<p>You have no communication networks.</p>
<p>You have no food deliveries.</p>
<p>You have no land access.</p>
<p>Your streets are covered in rubble, and your hospitals are filled with wounded and dead. People can't even take care of themselves since they don't have disaster preparation kits around. </p>
<p>You have a metro area with eight million people, suddenly reduced to 1,214 km^2 of useless concrete. You can't begin to imagine what you've lost. You have your self and the people around you. Food won't last more than a few days. What water supplies you have will be used or contaminated in a day, or less. Sanitation failure leads to disease, and you can't even dig bio toilets in concrete. You can't get to hospitals, they're kilometers away, placed for easy access by automobile, and the major access routes are nothing more than piles of concrete and twisted steel.</p>
<p>It took days for my city to get water and food out to some of the harder hit areas of the suburbs, and most people could get out of the CBD in only a few hours of walking since it's only something like 16 blocks total.</p>
<p>You can't stay in NYC, you have to evacuate the entire populace, it's not a sustainable place to live. But you can't get out. Roads are covered in people, wounded, stranded cars and rubble. Freeways have collapsed and are site of mass deaths.</p>
<p>You are trapped. You'd have to walk. At least a hundred km out to somewhere not totally useless, then even further to somewhere that can help. With little to no food or water. It'd take days, and it would kill people.</p>
<p>I'm a Kiwi, I lived through two serious earthquakes in a modern, first world city, where the population has built with these kinds of events in mind, has procedures for the short and long term aftermath, and a populace who understands how to survive the first 3-5 days after such an event.</p>
<p>You are asking, what is the effect of an earthquake TEN to ONE HUNDRED times more powerful than the ones I lived through, in a city of twenty times the size, no building standards, no preparedness, and no personal survival kits.</p>
<p><strong>I cannot convey the overwhelming magnitude of how fucked you are.</strong></p>
<p>EDIT: If you want tips for preparedness, try reading around <a href="http://www.getthru.govt.nz/how-to-get-ready/emergency-survival-items/" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The damage would be staggering.</p>
<p>New York City (I'm guessing you mean the city, not the entire state), last experienced a big earthquake, and it was <em>only</em> 5.5 mind you, back in the 1800's . This was long before there were tall buildings within it. New York is not in a area prone to earthquakes bigger than that, but never say never.</p>
<p>What would suffer the most would be old &quot;Brownstone&quot; constructions made of brick. They are strong against pressures pushing &quot;down&quot; on them (the weight of the floors above them) but very, very bad against lateral (sideways) movements.   Imagine a stack of Jenga blocks.  Push down from above, and they are pretty strong.  Push the tower from the side though and....crash.</p>
<p>Modern skyscrapers built with steel are better at resisting earthquakes, but the building code requirements in NYC do not require new buildings to withstand earthquakes the way a skyscraper in say San Francisco or Tokyo do.  A level 8 earthquake like the one that hit Nepal would probably flatten most of the city, with loss of lives in the hundreds of thousands or possibly even millions if it hit in the middle of the day during a weekday, when the city is most populated with people working there.</p>
<p>It would be bad,  let's just say that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Max Spectral Acceleration of a short period (Ss,max)(~0.3 sec) building in new York is 0.56 g's and 0.141 G's for long (S1,max) (1 second period) (per USGS for state values, given an area code could be different). Design values for buildings per ASCE 7-10 is 2/3 of that value 0.56 <em> 2/3 = 0.373 for short (Sds) 0.141 </em> 2/3 = 0.094 for long (Sd1).
For the location of the Nepal EQ (per UFC/GSHARP): Ss,max = 2.24; S1,max = 0.94.</p>
<p>The location of the Nepal EQ had a max spectral acceleration of around 2.1 g's for a short period (~0.3 sec) building response, and 0.60 g's for 1 second building response and 0.10 g's for a 3 second building response.</p>
<p>This means that for a short period building, the acceleration was 93.8% of the maximum considered earthquake (MCE) and 63.8% for 1 second/long period buildings. In the US the 2/3 coefficient that we used earlier was to change from MCE to design earthquake (DE) values. We can see that for short period buildings the acceleration was far above the 66.7% of MCE used for design but for long period buildings it was below the design earthquake values.</p>
<p>So if an earthquake that had the same probability chance of hitting New York came, small buildings would likely be severely damaged and some collapsed, many of the larger buildings however would be fine. If the same energy of the earthquake hit New York, it would result in forces much higher than what they are designed for in an earthquake. EQs likely don't control most buildings in New York though, most would likely be controlled by wind so they may still have the capacity to survive the event but may need to be demolished as many would not likely have the performance to survive cyclical loading like an earthquake has.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr: it would cause a lot of damage to small buildings, skyscrapers would be a case by case basis but many would likely have to be demolished.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p>
<p>Update: didn't realize how much technical information/wording I was using...hopefully this will help! Spectral acceleration is the acceleration felt by the building given in G-force and is used to determine the force on a building. It changes depending on the frequency the building shakes in as a result of the ground moving.  A lower frequency (longer period because period = 1/frequency) will result in lower accelerations (lower force also because F=m*a).  Think of sliding a plate of jello back and forth, if it is taller (not as stiff) it will wiggle back and forth more slowly. This means the changes in velocity are slower so the accelerations will be slower. In each area there is a maximum considered earthquake, the kind people over at the USGS determine what the biggest earthquake and the most shaking that the ground will do based on the ground soil and nearby faults.  They determine what the G-force a building will see in that earthquake will be for a building that has a 0.3 second period (short period or Ss) and a 1 second period period (long period or S1). Engineers use these values to determine what the design values of the G-force for short (Sds) and long (Sd1) period building as well as any other period building. In the US we say the design earthquake will have G-forces 2/3 the size of the maximum considered earthquake. This design earthquake gives the g-forces engineers use to design the building. So each area will have buildings built for earthquakes that are likely to hit in that area.  In my response you can find a guesstimate for the destruction of an earthquake the same size and an analysis for the destruction of a size earthquake that has a similar statistical possibility of occurring in New York as the one that occurred in Nepal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be especially devastating because New York is a low risk location for earth quakes in the first place.  <a href="https://www2.bc.edu/~kafka/Why_Quakes/WQ_HazMap.png" target="_blank">Check out this map</a>.  When you prepare a city for emergency responses you have to prepare for least likely to most likely and I would assume that while New York is prepared for many things, earth quakes are not one of them.</p>
<p>The population density and importance of just a few bridges for transportation would make it a huge cluster fuck.  The buildings are probably not made to sway like tall buildings in California up to Alaska are.  Buildings that are too ridged fall like trees, but flexible buildings can sway a bit like grass and not get flattened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's almost impossible to overstate how bad a 7.8 would be in NYC. The city as we know it would cease to exist in seconds. </p>
<p>Every old brick building would collapse. Every fucking one; they're not designed to withstand any amount of shaking. And those alone make up a gigantic percentage of New York's building stock. </p>
<p>And even most of the newer ones probably couldn't take more than a 5 to 6 on the Richter Scale. And the only reason they'd have any chance of making it is because of completely unrelated building codes that just happen to make them somewhat more stable. </p>
<p>Now, most of the modern skyscrapers would survive, but again, it's largely just due to building codes intended to protect against other things, combined with the way such buildings are constructed in general. </p>
<p>And that's just accounting for collapses. You then have to think about the aftermath: immediate flooding throughout the city, unending fires from the Cloisters all the way down to Battery Park City ... Seriously, just take a look at any video of Lower Manhattan on 9/11 and multiply it by at LEAST 100, probably quite a bit more. That's what you'd be dealing with. </p>
<p>It's probably stupid as hell that our laws aren't just as strict as LA's, given that we have two fault lines running directly underneath the city (one around 125th Street, the other around 14th), but since the fault lines only show any meaningful movement once every few hundred years, nobody wants to do anything about it. (Retrofitting buildings to be quake-resistant is not at all cheap.) So all we can do is hope that the next quake doesn't happen for another couple of hundred years or more, long after we've figured out better ways to retrofit old buildings and simply wait for a lot of the old pre-1915ish buildings to be replaced. </p>
<p>Fun fact: Chuck Scarborough wrote a novel about an NYC earthquake in the early 1990s. He did a decent amount of research for it, and in it, the amount of damage was so overwhelming that the federal government completely threw in the towel and decided to turn the entire city into a combination park and museum, with only minimal housing or business of any sort. The destruction was THAT bad. But the fun part is that one of the few buildings to survive was the World Trade Center. (Because it was so tall, it was designed to sway quite a bit in high winds. That's what saved it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
