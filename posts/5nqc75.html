		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I learned in physics the acceleration of a mass (and the change of direction is an acceleration) results in a change of kinetic energy, so traveling in a narrow space like an electron around an atom requires acceleration to change the direction of the electron to stay around the atom, so then why are atoms stable at all and why don't electrons bounded to atoms lose energy all the time?</p>
<p>Edit: I meant acceleration of charge, not mass, thanks for pointig this out.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and one of the questions that led us away from the classical model of the atom and towards the quantum model. You are correct that the classical way we think of an atom (positively charged nucleus, negative particle in a circular orbit around it) would emit radiation, causing the electron to decay into the nucleus. The fact that this doesn't happen means this must not be the correct model.</p>
<p>We now know that the electron is not a point mass orbiting the nucleus at all, but a &quot;density cloud&quot; which constantly surrounds it. You've likely heard of the &quot;wave particle duality&quot; of light- well it's not just light which has this duality, all particles do (it's just most pronounced with light, since the less mass a particle has the more &quot;wave like&quot; it acts). So, the electron is in a wave around the nucleus (and actually, when it is in its ground state it is in a standing wave) so it doesn't radiate (in fact, when it is in an excited state it is no longer a standing wave, which is why it does radiate and then fall down to the ground state). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accelerating a mass doesn't necessarily cause its kinetic energy to change so long as the magnitude of its velocity is constant.</p>
<p>The previous answer explains a more complicated issue in that accelerating a charged particle does cause it to lose energy, and how the absence of this effect with electron orbits helped us understand that the typical chemistry book model of an atom is inaccurate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers here really:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you are correct that acceleration <em>can</em> cause a change in kinetic energy. However, there is a special kind of motion called <em>circular motion</em>, such as the approximate orbits of planets, where the acceleration is roughly perpendicular to the direction of motion at any given time, so the kinetic energy is unchanged. So the electrons, orbiting in circular motion around the nucleus, should not lose energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>However: Electrons have a charge. Highschool-level physics should tell you that accelerating a charged particle causes radiation to be emitted, and that this radiation carries away with it some of the energy of the particle. Accelerating the electrons in a circle, therefore, should cause them to lose energy. The solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave-particle duality. Everything is both a particle and a wave. When electrons orbit the nucleus, the orbitals behave as waves, and the electron does not truly accelerate, but simply exists in all possible places around the nucleus, with varying frequencies (we're pushing the limits of my physics knowledge here). Thus, no radiation is emitted, and no energy lost. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: A letter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dont think of an electron as orbiting around an atom but being &quot;stuck&quot; in an orbital. An orbital is an area in or around an atom that due to the collection of forces around it, the electron will &quot;stay&quot; in this area unless given enough energy to get out of this area, ie. it gets hit by a photon, or another electron flys by.</p>
<p>In the simplest atom, hydrogen, the first orbital is called S1 and is an area around the proton where the electron is &quot;trapped&quot;. If you have more then one electron, they will become trapped in other orbitals with names like S2, P2, ... Search &quot;atomic orbitals&quot; and you will get some pretty neat pictures of where the electrons end up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right, but atoms don't work like that. If they did they would be unstable because the electrons would be radiating energy. That's the main reason why Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom is wrong and this led to the development of quantum mechanics, where thinks work very differently (the question has no basis there as you can't say the electron is travelling and under acceleration).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
