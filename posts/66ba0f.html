The energy output by the sun is decreased by traveling theough the atmosphere. Would there be any benefit to using planes or balloons to collect the energy from the sun in power cells using solar panels above the majority of the atmosphere where it could be a higher output? Or, would the energy used to get them up there outweigh the difference from placing them on the earth's surface?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is actually currently being researched:
<a href="http://eas.caltech.edu/engenious/twelve/idea_flow" target="_blank">http://eas.caltech.edu/engenious/twelve/idea_flow</a></p>
<p>The idea is to launch arrays of space-based photovoltaic cells that would use microwave transmission to beam energy back to Earth. The big benefit of this type of approach is that it mitigates the variability of traditional solar panels. </p>
<p>In the short term cloud cover can cause variability in power output of solar cells and also the obvious issue of the day-night cycle. In the long term, the closer you are to the poles the more your sunlight varies throughout the year. What might be enough solar panels to get you through a 16 hour day in the Summer won't necessarily get you through an 8 hour day in the Winter.</p>
<p>A space-based solution could theoretically solve all of these problems by having several arrays of cells in geostationary orbit, such that some subset of them will be exposed to sunlight at all times. Since the energy could be beamed down in microwave spectrum, clouds etc. would not be as much of an issue as they are for visible light. </p>
<p>Obviously there are tons of technical issues to get this sort of thing working, but people are working on it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere is largely transparent to visible light, which is the range most conventional photovoltaics use. If located higher there could be a marginal increase (ignoring other factors at the moment) because there would be a few percent more of that light, however without the atmosphere blocking the more energetic wavelengths like UV the cells degrade requiring you to add thicker shielding/glass to mimic the effect of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Additionally photovoltaics have a reduced efficiency when hot, which is a concern when they are being hit by useless wavelengths (which normally the atmosphere blocks) that only heat the panels and contribute nothing to the actual generation of power while also having very little to no medium to assist in transferring that heat away</p>
<p>Finally you'd need a way to get that power from the panels back down to the ground, which could be done in a variety of ways, but realistically it's not practical from an engineering or cost perspective when you want the power at ground level in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, its called SBSP - Space-Based Solar Power. Most light is filtered by the atmosphere. With SBSP, it is collected and beamed down via microwaves.</p>
<p>There are plenty of excisting resources out there regarding SBSP:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We would need large scale storage to be viable. If the amount we could store was more than the energy required to send it into space then it'd be efficient. If not then no.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I have a related question. If we used solar panels in space to capture energy that would otherwise miss Earth (say at a certain point, the Sun, solar panel and Earth wouldn't be aligned.) Wouldn't this contribute to global warming? We are injecting more energy onto the Earth without taking any out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
