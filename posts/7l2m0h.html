		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dual clutch transmissions are basically a sequential manual transmission controlled by computers and therefore automated and programmed not to stall. If you are able to override the computer, then yes, it can be stalled.</p>
<p>CVTs are like automatics and use a torque converter and will not stall as if it were an automatic. However it is not strictly true that CVTs cannot be stalled as nothing prohibits you from installing a foot-operated clutch to the CVT(same with automatics), in that case, it can still be stalled</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, DCT:
These transmissions use two clutches - one for even gears and one for odd gears. This is what helps make them so fast. As you are about the upshift or downshift, the computer &quot;readies&quot; the other clutch's gear by selecting the higher or lower gear depending on whether you want to go up or down a gear. When the next gear is connected, and the computer is ready to shift, it can very quickly release one clutch and engage the other. Then it can select the next gear again on the disengaged clutch. You save the &quot;gear change&quot; time consumed by a normal manual transmission. If we had more legs, we could do the same thing with 2 clutch pedals.</p>
<p>That answers why they are fast and desirable, but why don't they stall? Well, the computer-controlled clutches do the same thing humans do while driving. When you come to a stop, the car selects first gear, but disengages the clutch. It can hold it's position using the brake (even if you aren't pressing it enough, like on a hill), or by slipping the clutch like a human might do. This can cause extra wear on a clutch, but it's pretty much the same way humans drive a manual transmission. The computer decides when you want to stay still, creep forward slightly, or move forward and continue accelerating. Then the computer modulates the clutch appropriately just like a human so that the car does this. This technology is still improving, and many people complain of &quot;jerky&quot; driving behavior especially in parking lots or with a cold car because the computer isn't as smooth with the clutch release as a human might be.</p>
<p>CVTs:
These actually use a torque converter typically. The ones that don't (like a motorcycle) use a clutch to follow the same principles as a normal manual transmission. CVT is all about the gears (not the clutch engagement of those gears).</p>
<p>To understand how CVTs work, picture a typical multi-speed bicycle where you have front and rear gears. You know that by moving the derailleur in or out on the front or rear gear sets you can adjust for high power and fast acceleration with a low top speed, or low power with low acceleration but a much higher top speed. The whole time though the chain on the bike remains the same length (I know that fixed gear sizes actually mean the derailleur needs to pick up some slack, but I am simplifying the explanation).</p>
<p>A CVT works on the same principle. Instead of using a chain, it uses a kind of belt that always stays in the same place. Both of the &quot;gears&quot; the belt rides on are actually like cones where one end is very small and the other end is very wide. Picture them like the small gear and the large gear on the back of the bicycle. By moving the cones towards or away from the belt, we can change the diameter of the front gear to be larger at the same time the rear gear is smaller (the belt stays in the same place). This would be like going to a large gear on the front of the bicycle, and a small gear on the back of the bicycle, except because they are cones the change is &quot;continuous&quot; instead of in steps like a bicycle. The result of all this is that we change the gear ratio in the transmission continuously, so as the car accelerates (higher MPH) we can adjust the gear ratio to keep the engine at the same speed (RPM). This is more fuel efficient and produces more power across the MPH range.</p>
<p>EDIT: Added some paragraph separation so it doesn't look like a 5 year old typed this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some CVTs and DCTs use electronically controlled clutches (or similar tech), which automatically engage the clutch when the engine revs above a certain limit. these cars are notable, because they do not inch forward when you release the brakes while the engine is idling in drive gear.</p>
<p>some CVTs and DCTs use torque converters, similar to how traditional automatic transmission vehicles.</p>
<p>in both cases, the system actively prevents the engine from stalling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically the engine is on one side and the transmission on the other. The aren't physically attached so no stalling while changing gears.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.makeagif.com/media/3-05-2016/83UNgZ.gif" target="_blank">And here's a CVT</a></p>
<p>it's like an automatic just a different way of doing it nothing really special.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
