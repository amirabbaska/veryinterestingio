<p>Many of the land based artillery guns had a longer range than the ship-mounted guns, so they were simply out-ranged.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually something I know something about. If you haven't read D-Day, by Stephen E Ambrose, I'd really recommend it if you're interested. All quotations are from Chapter 14 of the book.</p>
<p>They bombarded the crap out of the beaches. Several veteran soldiers have said the opening naval barrage on D day was one of the loudest things they had ever heard. One of the Allied airborne troopers tells it this way. &quot;The Barrage coming in was quite terrific. You could feel the whole ground shaking toward the coast. Soon they lifted the barrage farther inland. They sounded so big, and being poor bloody infantry, we had never been under naval fire before and these damn great shells came sailing over, such a size that you automatically ducked, even in the pillbox, as one went over, and my radio operator was standing next to me, very perturbed about his, and finally he said, 'blimey, sir, they're firing jeeps'&quot;</p>
<p>A total of 68 destroyers participated in the bombardment of the 5 beaches. Ambrose summarizes the reason why the success didn't work in the following way. &quot;In short, a tremendous tonnage of shells hit the beaches and batteries. The results, for the most part, were terribly disappointing. As anyone who has visited the normandy beaches will attest, this was not because of inaccurate fire, but rather the result of German skill in fortification building... They [the batteries] took many direct hits, dozens in some cases, but even the 14-inch shells failed to penetrate. The shells made pock marks, the knocked away some concrete, they exposed the steel reinforcing rods, but they did not penetrate.&quot; However &quot;Many of the German gunners inside were rendered deaf or knocked out by concussion&quot; from being inside a concrete bunker.</p>
<p>Tl;dr They tried. There was a lot of concrete.</p>
<p>Also, look down at Huggies130's reply for some really amazing pictures.</p>
<p>edit: Spelling</p>
<p>edit 2: More spelling, and I'm blown away by the gold. Thanks. Also, it turns out that Ambrose isn't that great of historian. His book is really well written though, even if not a perfect historian, so take the recommendation with a grain of salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did in fact do both naval and aerial bombardment. A combination of poor weather, little observation ability, and trying to make this a surprise (the bombardment was short) meant that most of the rounds missed the defenses or went past the defenses into the French countryside.</p>
<p>The inaccuracy in weaponry between WW2 and today cannot be understated. For instance, a B-17 in 1944 could carry 4,500 pounds of bombs, with a crew of 10, a distance of 800 miles into combat. Those bombs were unguided.</p>
<p>Today, a B-52 could carry <strong>70,000</strong> pounds of bombs, with a crew of 5, a distance of 8,000 miles into combat. It also flies twice as high and three times as fast. And oh yeah, they can drop a load of completely guided bombs.</p>
<p>So in WW2, it would take 16 B-17s with a total crew of 160 to fly a tenth of the distance the B-52 does in the hopes its bombs hit a single target - which more often than not, they missed. That same B-52 could hit <em>multiple</em> targets successfully on its one run - and oh, btw, that B-52 took off from the continental US.</p>
<p>Case in point: the first night of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 saw <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=29272" target="_blank">more targets successfully hit in a single night</a> than in the <em>entire Combined Bomber Offensive of 1942 and 1943</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned the close support provided by the navy during the landings. The naval bombardment was heavy and extensive, including thousands of rockets mounted on landing craft, but the German fortifications were built to withstand the attack. Shipborne gunfire was inaccurate, aerial bombing less so, which is why modern air forces use an $85k smart bomb rather than the fifty unguided bombs it would take to hit the target.</p>
<p>The ships got very close to the shore on Omaha, and one American destroyer was sunk by shore batteries. The battleship Texas was hit dozens of times, and several other ships were badly damaged. A gun firing from a non-moving bunker is just more accurate than a gun firing from a ship going thirty knots through waves, shooting at concealed, armored positions. Some officers gave the naval gunfire much of the credit for allowing the breakout from  Omaha, and the V Corps history sums it up: &quot;“Thank God for the Navy,” (V Corps commander MajGen) Gerow told Bradley, reporting that destroyers had literally sailed into the surf as little as 800 yards from the beach to fire directly at bunkers and machine gun positions...&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They did both <a href="http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/dday/utah.aspx" target="_blank">air and navel bombardment</a>.  However, that intense shelling is also a signal to defenders that the attack is happening here (one of the great intelligence coups of the war was convincing the Germans that the attack would occur in <a href="http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/dday/utah.aspx" target="_blank">Calais</a>).  So there's a point of diminishing returns (where landing may be easier after bombardment for several days, but further inland there would be more troops (since they had the entire bombing period to choose the best inland locations) and the beachhead is easily re-taken.  </p>
<p>They also were very limited by the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/06/d_day_normandy_landing_science_the_army_navy_compromise_on_tides_and_timing.html" target="_blank">tides and weather</a> (they had a 3 day tidal window and one day's weather was not good).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
