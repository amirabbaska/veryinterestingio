		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that if something were to happen the sun (e.g. say if it would explode), the effect of this change would not be felt on Earth until a sufficient time has passed for light from the initial position of the sun to reach the Earth (which like you say will take about 8 minutes).</p>
<p>The reason for this is that no information can propagate faster than the speed of light, and the same principle applies to the state of gravitational fields. When observing <em>changes</em> to a massive body (e.g. the sun) and its associated gravitational field, the changes are observed not in &quot;real time,&quot; (t) but rather at a delayed time called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_time" target="_blank">retarded time</a> (t')), which is given by </p>
<p>t' = t - R/c,</p>
<p>where R is the separation between the observer and the object. For example in the case of the sun, this retardation is (on average) 8 minutes, since this is the amount of time it takes light to reach the Earth. This means that any change in the sun would not just not be seen on Earth until 8 minutes later, but it couldn't cause any physical change on Earth at all until 8 minutes later.</p>
<p><strong>edit: Some caveats and clarifications...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I took the question in the original post to mean more generally how long it would take for an object subject to a gravitational field to feel the change in the field created by a change in the distribution of mass giving rise to the field. This is why I used the example of the sun exploding as a physically allowed example. However the sun cannot simply disappear instantaneously as this would violate a very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem" target="_blank">fundamental conservation law</a> of the sun's mass-energy. Because such a change is unphysical, there is no defined solution to the underlying field equations that would predict how the system would evolve. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3m2clx/if_the_sun_disappeared_from_one_moment_to_another/cvbhl84" target="_blank">The answer</a> given by /u/rantonels is rigorously correct on this point, please don't downvote his answer. </p>
</li>
<li>A lot of questions have come up on whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" target="_blank">quantum entanglement</a> somehow offers an example where information is transmitted faster than the speed of light. See /u/Weed_O_Whirler's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3m2clx/if_the_sun_disappeared_from_one_moment_to_another/cvbjh3f" target="_blank">great answer below</a> for why this is not true: even though entanglement applies without a delay, this does not mean that you can use the effect to transfer information faster than allowed by the speed of light.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If my understanding is right, it's also worth noting that for a <em>static</em> gravitational field, the &quot;speed of gravity&quot; can be considered infinite (instantaneous). In fact, if it weren't, planets could not orbit the sun as they do because of the 'delay.&quot; <em>Changes</em> in that field, however, propagate at the speed of light.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question was asked thousands of times here, you might want to check out the search function.</p>
<p>The situation you describe is incompatible with Newtonian gravitation, because non conservation of mass leads to inconsistency in the theory (failure of Gauss' law). So the answer is undefined.</p>
<p>Same in general relativity, but there you can salvage the situation by assuming the lost energy from the disappearing sun converts into gravitational radiation (for some reasonable sense of &quot;energy&quot;). In that case a gravitational shockwave of massive energy propagates outwards at the speed of light (for some sense of &quot;speed&quot;) destroying basically everything up to some distance.</p>
<p>The answer that the gravitational field &quot;shuts down at the speed of light&quot; is too naive because it ignores the fact that the sun &quot;just disappearing&quot; invalidates gravitation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
