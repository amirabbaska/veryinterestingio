<p>There are functions I can use to store a value between program states, but I can't store a list of values.</p>
<p>If I have 2, 8 and 15 and I want to carry them between states, I'd have to store 3 values, but is there a way to use a calculation that I could reverse that would produce a single number, so I could get the values back after?</p>
<p>I could store 2, 5 and 7 as 257 and have the program decipher it to return 2, 5 and 7 but that only works for single digit integers, and long lists would produce a number too large.</p>
<p>The use of primes comes to mind but im unsure how, or if it's possible. Ideas?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the values are limited in size you could store them by shifting the bits to the left as you go through the program (e.g. if they're limited by like 6 bits you can shift your second list element to the left by multiplying it by 2^6 ) and adding them together. Reversly you can “pop“ elements from the stack by usage of modulo operations (modulo (value;2^6 )  returns the last value on the stack and by doing value=(value/2^6 ) you remove the element you just read, assuming integer, so you can read the next one) Obviously you still have a limit for how many elements you can store and the “frame“ is static so you reserve the max amount of bits for a list element even if it doesn't use as many. Basically...the same idea you presented but by using a shift based on the binary basis instead of the base-10 system you should be able to save some space (And instead of only working for single bit integers it works for a wider range of values).</p>
<p>I believe you could get a much better answer on here if you can give people a little bit more context information. Usually when trying to “compress“ informations like this it's all about knowing which assumptions can be made about the stored elements, in what type of application they are used in etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Usually in situations like this you would store a pointer to a list of values allocated in some storage area that persists across both states.</p>
<p>This is why callbacks in C generally take only a single <code>void *</code> context argument -- if you need more than one value, you just use a pointer to a data structure. Or in Win16/Win32 the <code>LPARAM</code> or <code>WPARAM</code> parameters passed to the Window procedure callback are sometimes actual integers and sometimes pointers to larger data structures cast to integers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a programming answer and a mathematical answer. The programming answer is to use a data structure like an array or linked list to store the values. This is the most practical solution by far.</p>
<p>The mathematical answer is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering_for_sequences" target="_blank">Gödel Numbering</a> of some kind. There is no limit on the size of the numbers except that imposed by the maximum integer in your architecture and language. That page uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem - so not primes per se, but still number theory.</p>
<p>But you can use primes: if p_n is the <em>n</em>th prime number, you could let the product of p_n_1, p_n_2, ..., p_n_k represent the numbers n_1, n_2, ..., n_k. If you don't care about ordering, you can use this to store a multiple instances of the same value by letting p_n^2 represent n twice, for example. Of course you can use a similar trick to allow encoding ordering too, or use the Chinese Remainder Theorem from the wikipedia page.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How many are your values? Are they bounded? Despite the encoding being reversible, do you want it to have any more properties (or not to have)? Are they arbitrary integers, or do they have some sort of meaning? Is there an underlying distribution that you know of or assume?</p>
<p>PS. Assuming I won't have answers to any of these, you can look at <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PairingFunction.html" target="_blank">pairing functions</a>, e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/919612/mapping-two-integers-to-one-in-a-unique-and-deterministic-way" target="_blank">Cantor's pairing function</a> or <a href="https://hbfs.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/mild-obfuscation/" target="_blank">&quot;bit blenders&quot;</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Store them in base (2^n)-1, use the (2^n)th binary number to encode a break between numbers. The first four bits identify which base you're using</p>
<p>You would use the most convenient base for the number set. Base 3, for example, would use  00, 01, 10 as its digits, with 11 encoding a break between numbers. </p>
<p>So your numbers would translate to:</p>
<p>0011 (base 3) 10 (the number 2) 11 (break) 1010 (the number 8) 11 (break) 011000 (the number 15) </p>
<p>That's 20 bits, or 2.5 bytes storing the 3 separate numbers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
