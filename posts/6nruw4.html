		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, by looking at a whole bunch of YouTube videos of trials and sentences being read out to defendants for both petty crimes and very serious crimes, there are some things I really struggle to grasp:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Judges almost always seem to include their own, personal opinions and give a &quot;moral lecture&quot; to the defendent. The judge takes up a lot of &quot;space&quot; with his or her own personality, so to speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They seem to be able to &quot;make up&quot; punishments to some extent, e.g. sentencing the defendent to carry a sign with a humiliating message on it. Is this actually the case? Are these punishments explicitly defined in the law, or does the law in these cases give judges the freedom to come up with &quot;appropriate&quot; punishments?</p>
</li>
<li>Judges sometimes seem to subjectively change the sentence depending on what they feel like, e.g. someone being disruptive or insulting the judge: add 6 months of prison. A judge having a good day: remove (part of) a fine, or shorten a prison sentence. Is this actually the case? </li>
</ol>
<p>What's the reasoning behind all of this? How much of it is accurtate? Does it differ a lot by state?</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is because in Sweden, the judge has a much more passive and low-key role. While they of course still are the head of the court and responsible for the process and the order in the court, there is A LOT less focus on the judge.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At trial:</p>
<p>There are two types of trials, jury trials and bench trials. There are two types of questions - questions of law and questions of fact. In a jury trial, the jury is the factfinder. They get to determine whether the defendant is guilty or innocent by determining whether the defendant did what he was charged with based on the evidence. In a bench trial, the judge determines guilt or innocence. In either case, the judge also determines questions of law. They get to see whether legally, a certain piece of evidence can be introduced, certain questions can be asked, or certain witnesses are called. </p>
<p>In sentencing - the judge determines the sentences based on statutory guidelines. Sometimes there are mandatory minimums - for certain crimes (generally repeat offenders), the judge HAS to give at least the minimum sentence. In cases without mandatory minimums, the judge has discretion to reduce (or increase) the sentence due to mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Of course, they have to generally follow the guideline of no cruel and unusual punishment, so they cant impose a 10 year sentence for shoplifting a shirt. </p>
<p>For your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Judges generally want to give justice. In many cases, they will talk to the defendant and lecture them. But in sentencing, judges can explain why they sentenced the way they did. On top of lecturing the defendant, this is all recorded as part of the court record. That way on appeal, the judge's reasoning is nicely laid out in the transcript. If the appeal's standard is, &quot;did the judge abuse their discretion,&quot; having all the reasons laid out on record about why the punishment was given helps them not get overturned. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These cases are VERY rare. These cases are also not explicitly defined in the law. But they arent unlawful, per se, as long as they arent cruel and unusual. If someone decided to appeal the conviction based on the sentence and actually get it overturned because the punishment was cruel and unusual, then future judges wont/cant/shouldnt impose these sentences. But most people would rather hold up a sign for a couple hours than pay thousands of dollars in fines (plus hire a lawyer for an appeal, which can take years) or spend time in jail. </p>
</li>
<li>Its possible. If the defendant is being disruptive or insulting the judge, the judge might impose a higher sentence. But their reasoning will never be, &quot;because they insulted me.&quot; They will say, &quot;the defendant showed little remose and didnt respect the justice system.&quot; Whether the judge is being petty or not is probably unknowable. But on the flip side, a lot of judges are willing to find mitigating factors as well - if the person is remoseful, checked into rehab, apologized or paid back the victim or whatever, the judge will often reduce the sentence, or sometimes throw out the case altogether for some of the pettier stuff. </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>As for why the difference - Sweden is a Civil Law system, where only Legislative Acts are law. The United States is a Common Law system based on a principle called &quot;stare decisis&quot; - meaning that judges create precedent for future judges to follow. Neither system is better than the other, just different. </p>
<p>For example, take the crime of Conspiracy. Conspiracy is generally defined as, &quot;two or more people agree to commit a crime and take a step in trying to commit the crime.&quot; Lets pretend both the US and Sweden have this law. Say we have a drug buy. One person sells, one person buys. Technically the selling and buying of drugs can fit under &quot;Conspiracy&quot;. However, both systems realize that this isnt the type of crime that the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; law was meant to tackle - its not conspiracy if the crime necessarily needs at least 2 people to be committed. In the US, a judge can say that in their opinion. Their case changes the current law of Conspiracy to not include these types of drug buys. In a Civil System, the Legislature needs to come forward and make this part of the law, which can take up more time. But on the flipside, they also get less abuse of power, and finding the current law is a lot easier (in the US, you might have conflicting legislation and judge-made precedent, so you might go go digging to find the most recent law and determine how much power the most recent law has). </p>
<p>From what I understand, Judges take a more active role in Civil Law systems for factfinding (calling witnesses, asking questions, presenting evidence) but less in sentencing. In the US Common Law system, the Judges rarely ask questions or present evidence. The lawyers are the ones to present all the evidence, and the Judges are there to make sure the evidence is legit. </p>
<p>EDIT - I should add that most (like 90-95%) cases are resolved with a plea bargain. There are very few guidelines for a plea except for other sentences imposed by the judges before you, and judges often subvert mandatory sentences by accepting a plea. Also, accepting a plea is considered to be a mitigating factor to reduce sentences -
since youre willing to accept responsibility for the crime (which in practice is a lot more complicated, but thats a different problem), the judge takes that into consideration. </p>
<p>And the word &quot;sentences&quot; can mean many different things that isnt jailtime. There have been a huge history of ways to give shorter/less severe sentences for crimes - things like suspended sentences. For example, a possible sentence is &quot;1 year suspended for 2 years.&quot; That means you have 1 year of jailtime, but you dont actually go to jail. You go on probation for 2 years, and if you make it through probation, you dont have to spend that year in jail. If you screw up on probation, you go to jail for the full year. \</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Sometimes the law forces the judge to impose a certain sentence, these are usually called mandatory minimums. For the most part, though, the judge has the power to decide the sentencing (except for the death penalty, that usually has to go through) the jury.</p>
<p>Also, the federal court system has sentencing guidelines that aim to standardize the process and take away some of the judge's discretion. A few states have guidelines too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They can't sentence them to hold up a sign as the punishment for the crime. They can however offer it as a condition of probation.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, they can offer almost anything except torture as a condition of probation. &quot;No computer use for 4 years&quot; is a fine deal if the alternative is a 10 year prison sentence, even though it's borderline impossible to survive without a computer (and this has been ordered often in hacking cases).</p>
<p>The key there is that the convicted person agrees to wear a clown wig rather than take the standard sentence. They don't have to agree, in which case they'll get the standard sentence, which in America at least is usually very draconian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For most offenses other than first degree / capital murder there's a range of suggested sentences based on the crime, any aggravating or mitigating factors, and prior convictions rather than a strict schedule. For example the sentencing guidelines for a home invasion might be 5-10 years, for possession of heroin fine/probation to 60 days, etc. In some cases judges can deviate from those if they have a good reason, but that's likely to set up an appeal. For the most part they do stay within the guidelines. But 5-10 years is a big range. What the sentence is depends on how tough on crime the individual judge is, how the defendant behaves, whether the judge is having a bad day, etc. </p>
<p>Imagine a defendant breaking down crying in front of a judge saying how much he regrets his acts, combined with a judge that believes in short sentences to primarily rehabilitate, on a Friday afternoon, with support of his family after the judge has just won $1000 in lottery tickets. Then take a defendant on a Monday morning how hurls f-bombs at the court, says he didn't do it or his victims deserved it, in front of a judge who's tough on crime who just wrecked her car on the drive into court that morning. </p>
<p>The really creative punishments make news because they're so rare. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
