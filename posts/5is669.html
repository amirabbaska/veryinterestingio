It's molten after all, it must have some sort of fluid dynamics to it, right?</p>
<p>I was wondering why the ring of fire is where it is, and came to the conclusion that the shape of the pacific ocean seems conducive to an oceanic suction effect that might add stress to plate tectonics in a ring shape. I'm no physicist but I don't see why a substance covering most of the earth's surface can't affect the earth in much more substantial ways than rising and falling tides. </p>
<p>To follow up, would rising sea levels mean more/stronger earthquakes due to the greater stress exerted by water on plate boundaries?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is unusual in two ways: it has a magnetic field and a very large satellite. The reason it has a magnetic field is because of the dynamo effect of a molten core, which also gives rise to plate tectonics.</p>
<p>The cores of both Venus and Mars appear to have cooled and solidified long ago, with the result that they do not have plate tectonics.</p>
<p>Mercury was expected to have a solid core also, because it's size should have allowed it to cool and solidify, but the Mariner 10 spacecraft detected a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11782-molten-core-may-explain-mercurys-magnetic-field/" target="_blank">magnetic field</a>. Although it is not mentioned in that article, tidal heating caused by the sun is a candidate for the cause of this.</p>
<p>Likewise, tidal heating by the moon has certainly contributed to the persistence the molten state of Earth's core, although the magnitude and significance of the effect is not easy to establish.</p>
<p>Our magnetic field, along with the atmosphere, deflects charged particles headed toward the surface of the Earth. It is part of the reason life has persisted and evolved; otherwise DNA damage would at least have created a selection pressure that would certainly have altered the situation as it exists today.</p>
<p>It is therefore possible that the moon indeed has contributed both to plate tectonics and the existence of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>Plate tectonics is the surface expression of thermal convection in the Earth's mantle. Primordial heat from the Earth's formation combined with radioactive decay produce a very hot interior. This heat needs to escape to the surface. The rocks of the solid mantle are hot enough that they flow like a liquid on geologic timescales. If you could see the inside of the Earth's mantle sped up over hundreds of millions of years, you would see it turning over like a pot of boiling water. </p>
<p>At the surface, new oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges. These mark the upward branches of convection. This new crust is transported horizontally to subduction zones, where it sinks back into the mantle. These mark the downward branches of convection. Along the way, the oceanic crust loses heat to the surface. By the time the crust sinks into the mantle at subduction zones, it has become cold and dense. The sinking crust cools the Earth's interior.</p>
<p>TL;DR: plate tectonics is powered by thermal convection of the mantle, not tides from the moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes, the moon pulls on the earth's crust and its oceans as it orbits the earth. Just not nearly as much as the movement of magma forcing its way to the surface and &quot;pushing plates around&quot;.
If you stood on a scale at times when the moon was directly over you vs directly opposite on the other side of the earth, you wouldnt be able to notice much of a change in your weight.
I think the noticable effect on the tides, is due to the fluidity of the oceans, allowing the waters to build up momentum over time as they &quot;chase the moon&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
