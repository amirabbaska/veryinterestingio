<p>All for the same essential reason. Something clear is clear because its structure is well aligned to allow light to pass through with<strong>out</strong> lots of refraction or absorption. Snow flakes (and bubbly water, and glass shards) provide millions of surfaces, all pointing different directions, sending light bouncing and bending and absorbing in all sorts of ways. The light gets diffused into what you see as white. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that in reality both liquid water and ice/snow have an intrinsic blue color. This color comes about because water and ice absorb the red part of the spectrum more strongly, leaving blue light to be reflected. However, in the case of ice/snow a second mechanism is at play, namely diffuse reflection caused by scattering and multiple reflection events. This diffuse reflection overwhelms intrinsic color of the ice and gives off a white appearance. </p>
<hr />
<p>To see that liquid water really looks blue, all you have to do is to look at a big clean body of water such as the ocean. You can make sense of this color by looking at its <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WWn5L3Z.gif" target="_blank">absorption spectrum</a>. As you can see in the graph, the absorption coefficient keeps rising as you move through the visible spectrum from blue to red. As a result, the red end of the spectrum gets absorbed more strongly, leaving mostly blue light to be reflected. Now this absorption coefficient is also very low, which is why a small volume of water looks clear and it is only once you have a sufficiently long optical path that the faint blue color becomes apparent.</p>
<p>Now in the case of ice, the absorption spectrum changes a bit, but not that much in the visible part <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cCqFZ5u.gif" target="_blank">as you can see here</a>. As a result, you would once again expect ice to look clear for small bits and blue for sufficiently large chunks. Indeed that is true, but in many cases this color is hidden by a second factor: diffuse reflection. In the case of snow, part of this diffuse light comes from multiple reflection events <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Diffuse_reflection.gif" target="_blank">as light passes through the crystal</a>. Another somewhat related mechanism is scattering. Defects inside of the crystals as well as the air gap between the individual snowflakes can act as scattering centers. Moreover, because these spatial variations are on the length scale of visible light or larger, the mechanism at play will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">Mie scattering</a>. This type of scattering is largely wavelength independent, which is why the scattered light looks white. The exact same effect explains why clouds are also white. More to the point, it also explains why ice cubes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/E6PnR07.jpg" target="_blank">can look clear in some parts and white in others.</a> The white patches tend to be concentrated near the center where the crystals grew faster and with more defects.</p>
<p>edit: Elaborated on the importance of multiple reflection along scattering in causing the diffuse reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with /u/crnaruka here. The color of water doesn't matter, and the scattering due to snow does not really depend on a Mie scattering calculation. Snow is white because of how crystal surfaces reflect light.</p>
<p>Snow being white is basically the core idea behind <a href="http://www.shimadzu.com/an/molecular_spectro/uv/accessory/solidsample/solid.html" target="_blank">diffuse reflectance measurement</a>, a scientific technique for measuring the spectrum of a powder. Basically, at every interface some of the light is reflected and some of it is transmitted.</p>
<p>The key point here is that reflection happens at <em>every interface</em>, so if you have a lot of interfaces (say, by grinding your material into a fine powder) you will get a lot of reflections. Reflected light tends to leave the powder while transmitted light penetrates deeper into it, which then gives it more chances to get reflected. Thus, having more interfaces per unit volume shifts the balance in favor of reflection. THAT is why finely ground powders, or snow with small crystallites/grain sizes look brighter.</p>
<p>The reason fine powders look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection" target="_blank">flat</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection" target="_blank">specular</a> is because the little interfaces you get from grinding or random packing aren't aligned, they are randomly oriented. This is also why people can get snow-blindness - the snow particles are so small they make excellent (diffuse) mirrors that reflect almost all the incoming light, which is enough to blind people. The absorption spectrum also doesn't matter very much because the light isn't penetrating very far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR;</strong> The light bounces around in the snow a lot more than it does in water. In water, light simply refracts a little. In snow, light bounces around in lots of cavities, scattering the light pretty much everywhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at water you are looking at a single phase with no difference in refractive index as a beam of light crosses it and so it appears transparent. When you look at a snow pile, you are looking at innumerable phases, solid water as flakes and air between the flakes. At every change in phase, light will bend and soon any beam of light will be broken up into countless beamlets, some of which shine back at you. So you see white light. Called 'scattering'. Same thing as fog, smoke, 'steam', dust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
