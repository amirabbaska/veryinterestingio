<p>Math wasn't handed down from us from the gods, perfect and written in stone. People invented it by asking questions and finding rigorous answers through what evolved into mathematical deduction and proofs. The thing is, if you ask a good question, then its answer will produce hundreds of more questions, so you are left with even more things to answer. Repeat for 2000 years, and you get today where hundreds of new results in math are being published every day, and so many more questions being asked without an immediate answer. Math is much more than college algebra and calculus, just like a glacier is much more than a single snowflake. </p>
<p>The amount of math activity, as measured by papers published, has increased exponentially through time, and it's not showing any signs of slowing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you solve the Collatz conjecture? Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2. If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process with the new number. Indeed, no matter what number you choose, you will always eventually reach a repeating cycle (4, 2, 1).</p>
<p>The conjecture has not yet been proven, but it is considered to be true because it has been tested for all integer values up to 5×2^60.</p>
<p>Two famous mathematicians, Paul Erdős and Jeffrey Lagarias said respectively: &quot;Mathematics may not be ready for such problems&quot; and &quot;This is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics.&quot;</p>
<p>And guess what? Tons of other similar problems exist in mathematics, just like in physics, chemistry, biology and other natural sciences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm super late to the party, but...</p>
<p>Mathematics is constantly reinventing itself. Early on, and for much of its history, people reasoned about mathematics in a very loose way. Sure, we had some notion of formalism with Euclid's axioms, and people tried to be rigorous in their arguments, but they assumed people knew what a &quot;function&quot; was or that proofs worked a certain way. This completely blew up with the invention of calculus, where intuition turned out not to be entirely reliable. People ended up proving a bunch of &quot;contradictory&quot; results because it turns out they were talking about slightly different things or didn't quite consider every case. How embarrassing!</p>
<p>Well, people set out to fix this problem. From the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, there was a major effort to reduce mathematics to the mechanical derivation of true statements (and proofs of them) from a set of agreed upon rules. The goal was to be able to come up with a proof for any true statement you could formulate according to the rules. This would give a solid basis for mathematics to build out from, one we could have been sure of the correctness of.</p>
<p>This failed <em>spectacularly</em>. Kurt Godel shot it in the heart while Alan Turing shot it in the head. Either's proof would've been the end of that effort, but together, that effort was totally dead. However! the effort to mechanize mathematics <em>did</em> give a consolation prize, in the form of the electronic computer. (In those days, a &quot;computer&quot; was a person who did your calculations for you by hand.)</p>
<p>From that point forward, there's been a persistent effort to explore the way in which we can &quot;formalize&quot; mathematics -- that is, how we can come up with rules and frameworks to reason with.</p>
<p>This exploration is still very much alive. There was some major work from the early-1900s to the present on working out alternative ways to describe the process of reasoning. In fact, very recently a new framework (which expanded on some older ideas) called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory" target="_blank">Homotopy Type Theory</a> was published. This framework came about because a very smart man had an error in his work for <em>years</em> before anyone noticed, and decided that we needed new, more powerful methods of proof-checking on computers. Automatic proof-checking would make mathematics (and potebtially programming) better, by letting us be <em>sure</em> our claims were true.</p>
<p>So, even today, major work is happening on even basic mathematics -- like describing how we reason and prove things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of open problems in mathematics, but as a non-mathematician you're probably most interested in the problems that are applicable to other fields. A lot of these are things that science suggests are true, but whose formal proofs are very difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li>One example is the formalization of quantum field theory (see <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4068/formalizing-quantum-field-theory" target="_blank">here</a> for a discussion). Quantum field theory (QFT) is the theory used by physicists to describe the behavior of the universe except gravity, and has been remarkably successful at producing testable predictions agreeing with experiment. However, these calculations have gaps in their logical derivation: there's a mathematical argument, then a jump that doesn't make sense, then more math. Trying to find a way to explain these calculations with mathematics would greatly increase our understanding of QFT and hence the universe, as well as make such calculations more methodical. This is an active area of research.  </li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" target="_blank">P versus NP</a> problem --- you might consider it computer science, but programs to prove it, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory" target="_blank">geometric complexity theory</a>, use a lot of sophisticated and recent mathematics. The problem basically asks whether there are fast algorithms for a certain class of hard problems. Many of these problems occur in applications in software engineering (e.g. graph coloring is used in optimizing compilers and SAT solvers in constraint solving), so having a considerably faster algorithm on large outputs could have concrete effects in software development.  </li>
<li>A lot of problems in theoretical cryptography (e.g. shortest vector problem in a lattice, hardness of discrete log, hardness of factoring) are thought to be difficult to reverse-engineer, but there has been no proof. The existence of a proof would bolster certain protocols --- and a counterexample would force us to change the protocols in use on the Internet right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other problems that readily apply to the rest of the world: topological quantum field theory is being applied to increase the reliability of quantum computers, for just one example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
