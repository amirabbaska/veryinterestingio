		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood vessels have some pliability to hem but not much. There are many instances in traumatic joint and extremity injuries where a vessel can be ruptured by the twisting and pulling force or severed by hard tissue like bone or cartilage. One of the things we look for in traumatic extremity injuries is whether or not we can feel a pulse or assess blood flow below the injury point. If there are signs that blood flow has been compromised then that person would need to get to an operating table ASAP. A very recent example of a traumatic injury causing blood vessel rupture was the injury to Chicago Bears TE Zac Miller who had a devastating knee injury that tore his popliteal artery in his Left Knee. </p>
<p>Not a MD but I have 17 years between Combat Medicine and civilian Paramedicine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood vessel twist and can accomdate this to an extent. Go to far and you risk damage. Interestingly part of the reason you cant twist your neck all the way around is related to this. In fact owls evolved a very interesting adaptation to the blood vessels feeding their brain which allows them to twist their head ~240 degrees. The blood vessels widen near the base of their neck so blood pools thus allowing them to pinch the blood vessels as they twist their neck further then we can and still provide blood to their brain.</p>
<p>Its very interesting. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple google-scholar or pubmed search will reveal many studies and case reports regarding damage to arteries (such as dissections) caused by hyperextension of a joint - that is, extending a part of your body beyond its normal range of motion. As well all know, simply <em>trying</em> to extend a joint beyond its normal range of motion is painful, and this is a good reason to obey that pain.</p>
<p>But yeah that said, things are kind of pliable. If you watch videos of surgeries, you will eventually see surgeons sort of plucking at or even pushing/pulling on blood vessels to either work on them, assess their health, or access something beneath. So in that context, you can literally see how flexible they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body actually uses movement from your joints to circulate blood back to your heart.  Veins have “gates” in them that allow the blood to flow in one direction.  the bending from your joints pushes the blood through these gates back to the heard.</p>
