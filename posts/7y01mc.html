<p>Wgen you see the shielding at the entry and exit it is quite obvious they can not emit a lot of radiation.</p>

&quot;The radiation dose typically received by objects scanned by a cabinet x-ray system is 1 millirad or less. The average dose rate from background radiation is 360 millirad per year. The minimum dose used in food irradiation for food preservation or destruction of parasites or pathogens is 30,000 rad.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well a luggage scanner is fluoroscopy, which is on all of the time, and medical imaging is on a short period of time. You have to think about the density of the object being radiographed. Ask yourself, is, or can, luggage be more dense than human tissue? You can adjust both fluoroscopy and an x-ray tube's penetration. An abdominal x-ray will be less than a skull x-ray. Luggage with books and metal objects will need more penetration than luggage full of clothes. Long story short, it depends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, requires the potential risks from a procedure to be carefully balanced with the benefits of the procedure to the patient. Because the patient must be exposed to a continuous source of X-rays instead of a momentary pulse, a fluoroscopy procedure generally subjects a patient to a higher absorbed dose of radiation than an ordinary (still) radiograph. Only important applications such as health care, bodily safety, food safety, nondestructive testing, and scientific research meet the risk-benefit threshold for use. In the first half of the 20th century shoe-fitting fluoroscopes were used in shoe stores, but their use was discontinued because it is no longer considered acceptable to use radiation exposure, however small the dose, for nonessential purposes. Much research has been directed toward reducing radiation exposure, and recent advances in fluoroscopy technology such as digital image processing and flat panel detectors, have resulted in much lower radiation doses than former procedures.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
