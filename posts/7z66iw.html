		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on <strong>Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.</p>
<p>The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.</p>
<p><strong>Answering Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience" target="_blank">The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here</a>. In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.</p>
<p>If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/" target="_blank">please refer to the information provided here</a>.</p>

<p>do animals recognize rhythm?  so if i'm sitting on the couch with my dog, and we're both listening to music, we can both hear it.  my hand rests on his back, and i start tapping my fingers to the beat of the music.  does my dog recognize that the music and my finger tapping are connected/the same? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Have their been many studies done on ASMR? I'm curious about things like the prevalence and difference between people who claim the experience and people who do not.  I've only been able to find one or two pretty generic studies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How does a small birds survive freezing temperatures? Coupled with colder air at higher altitude, it seems like a sudden freeze would result in a lot of dead birds. Do they just huddle up and hope for a chance to get somewhere warmer? Do their feathers provide insulation like, per se, a squirrels fur? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1.) What happens to individual atoms when a material flexes or bends? Do their bond angles and bond lengths change at all?</p>
<p>2.) What would happen if we could enclose helium atoms inside another material? I don't mean in bonding, I mean like a cage of atoms surrounding a helium atom (I believe there's a name for such a configuration but I can't think of it). Would the material be lighter? Would it have any unusual properties?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
