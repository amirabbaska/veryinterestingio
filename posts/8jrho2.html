		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at churches today most of them accept evolution, theistic evolution or say that it is not in conflict with Christianity.</p>
<p>It is primary the evangelical protestantism that are common in part of the US that disagree with it. The are a loud voice in the US and they try to have political influence so they are noticed.</p>
<p>The Catholic church have had no definite stand on evolution but in 1950 Pope Pius XII confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation by God and not the product of purely material forces.They support supports theistic evolution but it is not a required teaching. Gregor Mendel 1822-1884 the founder of the modern science of genetics that shows what evolution worked with was a catholic abbot.</p>
<p>Theistic evolution is from the wiki article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Francis Collins describes theistic evolution as the position that &quot;evolution is real, but that it was set in motion by God&quot;,[3] and characterizes it as accepting &quot;that evolution occurred as biologists describe it, but under the direction of God&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So god can have guided it or intervened  more or less. It is compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological evolution but in it sefe not a scientific theory as there is no way to demonstrate that it is false ore true.</p>
<p>So the idea that evolution is not compatible with Christianity is not true. But for obvious reason you will hear more for the groups that is against the scientific theory and what to change education the from the groups that accept it. People don't protest for the current state so you will not hear from then except for counter protest.</p>
<p>The strong disagreement with evolution is among Young Earth creationism ie a world created by god that is less then  10 000 year ago from a literal reading of the bible. Their belief in incompatible with evolution and a lot of other sciences like geology, cosmology to name a few.</p>
<p>They primary take a stand against evolution because it is easy to get people involved and care if they are created by god  and not evolved from common ancestor to the other great apes. To say that sedimentary rock formed in a global flod vs millions of years of sediment deposits is not a subject you get people engaged in.</p>
<p>Old Earth creationism where you don't have a literal reading of the bible and a creating of 6 literal days. God can then have created and shaped thing over million or billions of years can exist in ways that are not incompatible with science. So if the bible is not literal true but part is  figurative or metaphorical description evolution is not a problem and is accepted with some theistic evolution modification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Darwin was fully aware of the heresy in his &quot;evolution by natural selection&quot; theory.
This was complicated by his respect and love for his wife, which opposed the idea.
This is why he postponed the publication for 20 years, constantly refining the text, cautiously hedging against critique.
Being a devout hypochondriac and awaiting his imminent demise, he wanted it to be published after his death.
This was not to be as Alfred Russel Wallace was about to scoop him and he reluctantly published it. He was immediately attacked by church figures such as Samuel Wilberforce.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Darwin and evolution we're considered assaults on Christianity because of other unrelated stuff going on at the same time. A few different ancient languages and works were deciphered including the Epic of Gilgamesh, which has a flood story similar to the one in the Bible, but older than any copy of the Bible by far. Lord Kelvin estimated the age of the Earth at 20-100 million years. Egyptian heiroglyphs were only recently deciphered, and new works were being translated all the time. The first fragments of the legend of Sargon of Akkad's birth, which shares many elements with the Moses story from the Bible were translated. To top it all off, the second  great awakening was on the downswing. The upshot of all of this was that religion was starting to look less like an immutable eternally static thing and more like something that changes over time, and religious people were extremely resistant to that idea. Along comes old Chuck saying that humans themselves haven't always been humans but changed over time, and that was just too much. People started attacking evolution with religious fervor, and they passed that antipathy to their kids and their kids kids and so on until today, when it's still going on but the original reasons are all but forgotten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Darwin’s ideas lead the way to us possibly answering some very BIG questions. Where did we come from? How did we get here? </p>
<p>These BIG questions were historically thought to be outside the realm of science and in the realm of the mystical or religious. Naturally the answers met some resistance (and still do) because of it. </p>
<p>But I think the reason it resonates so strongly with atheists is actually a bit different. When you really grasp the theory, it is so amazing and mind boggling that it is almost like a non-religious supernatural experience. And I don’t mean supernatural as in ‘outside nature’, more like a hypernatural experience, </p>
<p>Just focusing on something relatively small like the metamorphosis that a caterpillar goes through when it becomes a butterfly and how natural selection created <em>that</em> is breathtaking. And then combine this with an understanding of the underlying organic chemistry and the realization that the elements that make up it’s composition came from reactions in stars, and they have been assembled through natural processes to become this biological transformer that can fly...</p>
<p>It is almost unfathomable to think of anything more amazing than this. All from the natural world.  Atheists see the theory of evolution as connecting some of the most difficult dots in this puzzle. Darwins theory connected us lifeforms with the natural world. All of us. When you have a naturalistic worldview, this is a grand slam. </p>
<p>Personally, I think the the theory of evolution is the biggest discovery thus far by humans. Period. I struggle to think of a bigger question than ‘how did we get here’ or ‘where did we come from’. These questions now have an answer that begins to make sense. And ‘where are we going’ is also something we might now be better informed about as well, since we know how we got here.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only question that might be bigger is ‘<em>why</em> are we here’. I’m not convinced that Darwin’s theory doesn’t help answer this as well. After all, <em>why</em> does the sun rise and <em>how</em> does the sun rise are really the same question. Why are we here? Because nature selected for us, that’s why. Like round planets. Like aerodynamic birds. Like long necks on giraffes. Like thinking creatures. We have survived, that’s why we are here.</p>
<p>Yeah but ‘what is our <em>purpose</em>’ you might ask. Maybe this is a bigger question that evolution can’t answer. Well, what is the purpose of fast predators? What is the purpose of green lizards in the forest? What is the purpose of beautiful flowers? What is the purpose of thinking creatures like us? Because of the theory of evolution, we now have a better way of thinking about these questions as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
