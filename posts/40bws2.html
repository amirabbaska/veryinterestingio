		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And you have just hit on one of the most challenging parts of being an attorney. Over many centuries of legal rulings, it's been determined that investigators should have a greater degree of freedom while they are trying to get to the truth. They are not bound by having hard-and-fast evidence when investigating a case because that would make it very, very difficult to do their jobs. A good example is how a policeman can ask a leading question to get a suspect to talk. Policemen can also lie to you (your buddy is ratting right now, so it's in your best interest to talk) for the most part at will, which a lawyer can't do.</p>
<p>That said, lawyers shows often fail to represent the most accurate rules of the courtroom. You often see lawyers in SVU or another show drawing conclusions during a witness' testimony even though that is not allowed. During a witness examination, it's the witness who is supposed to tell the story. You don't want a lawyer to narrate what happened when he called his own witness. The mentality is that you are calling them because they add to your case, and if they add to your case, let them talk. On cross, a lawyer is addressing the other side's witness, trying to poke holes in their story. The lawyer needs to be able to challenge them a little more, so they're allowed to lead the witness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leading a witness is perfectly OK in court when the witness would otherwise be uncooperative. On cross-examination, this is assumed; on direct, a witness who will try to avoid helping the person calling them can be treated as hostile, which means they can also be asked leading questions. A suspect is inherently hostile to the police, so it's not an issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former prosecutor here - what's important here are rules of evidence that control admissibility IN COURT. Police interrogations are not subject to these rules because they are not asked in court (they are subject to 4th, 5th, 6th amendment though).  Additionally, a defendant's statement is almost always admissible by the State because (theoretically at least) the defendant cannot be forced to testify and cross examine himself. Everyone here is correct in saying you can cross a witness on direct if they are hostile, BUT you cannot call a witness for the sole purpose of deeming them to be adverse/hostile.  And in practice, you don't want to risk shit going off the rails in front of the jury because your witness is being hostile. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the US, but in the UK the Police have rules and guidelines that they have to adhere to when detaining someone in custody (Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 - Codes A-G) and an interview 'guide' called the PEACE model which says that questions should be open (who, what, when, where, why, how) unless the person just isn't answering your question, then you can ask 'closed' questions. As for having a lawyer, that's a legal right, but having a lawyer doesn't mean that they'll get you off. If the Police have enough evidence then they'll usually just tell you to 'cough it' to save everyone's time, and your own. The Police can hold you up to 24hrs, 36 with an extension and more by appointment of a Magistrate. </p>
<p>As for 'leading questions' if you're a juvenile or have other 'needs' then you will usually be appointed an 'appropriate adult' to ensure the interview is conducted properly and fairly. As for everyone else, you're a big boy/girl. How you answer is up to you. But you had better know how to keep your story straight, especially with an experienced interviewer.</p>
<p>Unless of course you're innocent, in which case justice should prevail (*disclaimer - I'm fully aware this isn't always the case and do not speak on behalf of the Police)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
