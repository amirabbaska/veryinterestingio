		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body can only process so much sensation at once. By touching the place that you've hurt, you're basically distracting your brain from the sensation of pain by introducing pressure. </p>
<p>It's another reason why ice packs can help with pain - not only do they reduce swelling, they introduce the cold sensation and give your brain something else to think about other than the pain. </p>
<p>Edit: what I've described above is apparently known as Gate Control Theory. I didn't know this, all I've done is transcribed the explanation that I was given when I was little, because my dad is a very knowledgeable man and I used to ask a lot of questions! </p>
<p>I think it's worth noting some of the other theories given below that may have been buried: you instinctively check the damage to see if you are bleeding or missing anything; you place pressure on the area to stem the bleeding. </p>
<p>I'd imagine it's a combination of the three, and probably more! Thanks for your input everyone. I've learned a lot today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I find interesting about this is that we don't just do it to ourselves. When someone I care about (like my kids or my fianc√©) is in pain, my first impulse is to cover the area with my hands. This is true of both injuries and incidental aches like sleeping on it wrong. And, medicinal or not, it always seems to help. I don't think I'm likely to be healing them with my touch, but it does seem to calm them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have described the mechanics of it, but I wanted to point out that there's a evolutionary behavior hypothesis/conjecture for why we never evolved a different response, and maybe even encouraged it: if you grab your head at the site of an injury, you're putting pressure to prevent blood loss there, and you can also feel anything like a splinter still stuck in your skull or a drop bear latched onto you.</p>
<p>PS: I hope the readers of this thread don't mind a spot of writing advice. In the case of this title the author probably wanted &quot;e.g.&quot; which means &quot;for example&quot;. &quot;i.e.&quot; translates to &quot;that is&quot;, and is usually used to give a general solution to a list; eg, &quot;Beagles, dachshunds, bloodhounds; ie, hound dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>To get a little more specifically literary-device-y, when it's used the way it is in this title, it makes it sound like the only thing the speaker cares about is someone hitting their head on a corner, and that starting out with &quot;get hit&quot; was just playing coy.</p>
