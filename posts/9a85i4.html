<p>High estrogen favours storage in the lower body, known as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoid_fat_distribution" target="_blank">gynoid</a> fat distribution pattern, commonly seen in women.</p>
<p>Low estrogen favours storage in the trunk,  known as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_fat_distribution" target="_blank">android</a> fat distribution pattern, commonly seen in men.</p>
<p>Cortisol, testosterone, insulin, and hgh all play a role in how readily your body stores fat, but not really where it's stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Exercise and diet that are appropriate, will cause you to lose overall body weight, from everywhere it stores it, most likely leaving fat where it first formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a common misconception that you can spot reduce body fat, you can't target where to lose fat. However areas like the stomach have more fat than other areas, so they are usually the first place you will notice trimming down.</p>
<p>As for gaining weight, if its just fat you'll gain in more in high fat areas like I mentioned above. If its hypertrophy (muscle growth) you'll gain it in muscles you are training.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres a study that measured Tennis players bodyfat % in there arms and after a prolonged period of time, the dominat arm ended up the same BF % as the other arm that wasn't used at all.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Now, they also did a controlled study, with four different groups of men, all on the same food regimen, all eating at a deficiet.</p>
<p>Group 1: Trained only legs three times a week and did 30 min of medium intensity cardio after training</p>
<p>Group 2: Trained only upper body three times a week and did 30min of medium intensity cardio after</p>
<p>Group 3: Trained only legs three times a week with no cardio after</p>
<p>Group 4: Trained only upper body three times a week with no cardio after</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Results, while they all ended up losing bodyfat, the interesting results came Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 had lost a significant more amount of bodyfat in there legs compared to the rest of the group, and group 2 lost a significant more amount of body fat in there upper body compared to the rest of the group.</p>
<p>​While we can't choose the body part that our fat wants to burn, I think we an at least influence or body to use either our upper body or lower body as fat based on the results but only after doing a cardio session after.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am no scientist or researcher so don't quote me word for word but how they explained it was, after doing an upper body or lower body workout, our body takes adapose tissue out of ? and is ready to be used as energy but a lot of it never gets used and ends up going back to where it was and that is why doing cardio after a workout significantly affected the results. </p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Now, if I could only find the study and link it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
