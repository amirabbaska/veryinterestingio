		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also probably has to due with HIPPA laws, which protect your health privacy.  Only people that you have designated can have access to your medical information.  You can also limit what information is told to that person.  For example, if I am having blood work done I can give the office permission to disclose any information about my results to my significant other.  They can share ANY result with him/her.  Maybe I don’t want my SO to know anything about my results.  I can limit the information so that the only information that is given is for me to call the office back.  </p>
<p>Doctors can’t even communicate to doctors without your permission information about your health.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electronic Medical Record systems exist but tend to be customized for each hospital. I worked with EMR systems. As an example of changes that make it hard to translate, some hospitals use 2 gender fields, (Male and Female), some have 3 (Male, Female, Unknown/Other), some use even more (most I've heard of is 8). Computers aren't smart, so even translating one hospitals M/F to or from another hospitals Male/Female is difficult.  Changing the number of options makes it even more difficult.</p>
<p>There are also reason for records about who you are. They want to know what your current condition is. You might see offices asking for you to fill out the same paperwork for every visit so they can track if you've moved, or changed medications (maybe in ways your doctor doesn't approve). Having you re-write your information is far more reliable than asking if you've moved since your last visit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Denmark has a universal system. </p>
<p>Most medical professionals don't understand how it works, it's cost millions more than planned, caused a huge number of errors, and generally been less than an immediate success. </p>
<p>In a country like the USA I suspect convincing a population which doesn't want social security numbers to be universal that their medical records should be might be challenging. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
