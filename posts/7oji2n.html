		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these animals are herd/pack/family animals. They interact socially based on trust, affection and mutual benefit, same as humans. A human carer provides an animal with activity, food, treatment, training, and leadership. Pack animals have a need for all of this, same as humans.</p>
<p>We don't really know what goes on in their brains, but it is probably something similar as to what happens in our own. Trust, physical connection and relationships are deeply ingrained instincts in many animals and most mammals, we humans are not special in that regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main studies being done right now are focusing in on <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/333.full" target="_blank">the importance of hormones, specifically oxytocin</a>, in reinforcing the bond between people and dogs. Basically, I pet a dog, we look into each other's eyes, and both of our bodies release oxytocin, which creates a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>The more we study animals the more we find that brains have similar structures and therefore act in similar ways across many species, with small differences in function and degree. For example, humans have higher cognitive functions than dogs while humans and dogs also share many primary emotions. As a result we share things like feeling good around each other, or food, and being fearful or anxious around things we associate with pain. This is why you'll see positive reinforcement and positive punishment used to modify behavior across so many different species. </p>
<p>Humans do have more sophisticated secondary and tertiary emotions, like a more developed sense of guilt, or contempt. But I would argue that it is dogs' lack of these more sophisticated emotions that is partially behind why we adore them so much. They are easy to read, identify with, and make happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>simple conditioning - animals learn that certain behaviors lead to rewards and others to punishment...in particular, they learn to associate their owners with getting food</li>
<li>social behavior - many animals live in packs and/or family groups, and incorporate their owners into that structure</li>
<li>hormones - many mammals, including humans, release hormones during physical contact/grooming that encourages bonding</li>
<li>domestication - animals genetically change over time to better serve the needs of their owners</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what is going on in the animals' brains, that varies greatly from species to species and is not completely understood.  Social animals derive comfort from fitting into their social order correctly and feel anxiety when they do not.  When your dog shows you &quot;affection&quot;, it is last least in part a way to reinforce that social order.  Other animals, particularly reptiles, likely just come to associate you with food and warmth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all animals/pets bond with humans.  It's rare to see lizards and reptiles form bonds.. they will appear to cuddle but are really just sucking up their handlers warmth.</p>
<p>Mostly what happens is if the animal is cared for by a human from a young age it learns that the human is an easy way to get food.  Some animals &quot;imprint&quot; on humans if raised by humans from birth - such as with bottle fed livestock and hand-raised birds.  I had a sheep that I had to bottle feed and she followed me everywhere.  I had a rooster I raised in the house too, and he was the same.. eventually attacking me... but.. that's common in male animals when hand raised - they sometimes become pushy, and rude..</p>
<p>Mostly with cats and dogs they have been domesticated for thousands of years and even if born feral and tamed later they soon learn that humans = easy food and warm places to sleep.</p>
<p>As for animals giving hugs.  It's hard to say if the animal thinks it is &quot;hugging&quot; us or just getting close for itches/pats/rubs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
