Is there something unique about the makeup of muscle fibers that prevents abnormal growth?</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm specifically referring to skeletal muscle and why rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is rarer than other types of cancer. (Thanks /u/seanbrockest) </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are- rhabdomyosarcoma, for example. </p>
<p>It's comparatively rare though because there isn't much turnover of cells in the muscle, and they don't get much exposure to carcinogens. Any lining of the body has a high rate of cell division, and that's where errors creep in. </p>
<p>Imagine photocopying the instructions for baking a cake every time you baked one, but instead of using a master copy you used the previous photocopy. And there's a little gremlin who can come in and change a number or a letter at random, and you don't know what the gremlin has been doing. </p>
<p>The first cake is fine. And so is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. Until eventually you can't quite tell if it's 5 or 6 ounces of sugar. Or what that squiggle means that you're supposed to add a teaspoon of. This is what happens with cancer. The photocopying is cell division, and the gremlin is the action of carcinogens on the DNA of the cell. Most of these errors get caught, either by the error checking in the cell division mechanism, by the immune system which kills off cancer cells, or by the cell simply ceasing to function properly and dying. </p>
<p>Muscle cells don't duplicate very often, unlike your skin or the lining of your bowel. Your lungs, skin, bowels etc are all basically linings, and so have loads of cell divisions going on all the time. Rhabdomyosarcoma is commonly a disease of childhood, as this is when muscles are growing and the cells are dividing. When someone trains a lot in the gym, they don't actually get new cells in their muscles, it's that the existing cells develop more muscle fibres within them, so the individual cells get bigger.  </p>
<p>Basically, the muscle cells are like a cake recipe that you bake once a year. Skin, bowel, etc etc are cakes that you bake every day. Lungs are cakes with a particularly disruptive gremlin, if you're a smoker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think an interesting question would be: is there any tissue of the body that never gets cancer?  Obviously there is a limit on human life and given enough time, every cell that divides can get cancer, but what are the cells that tend to never see this happen in the course of a human life?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually are many types of cancers that affect muscle tissue. You might need to increase your understanding of what muscle is. When you say &quot;muscle&quot; I think you might be specifically addressing the muscles that you train in a gym, whereas much of the body is actually different types of muscle. </p>
<p>Here's some brief reading to get you started. A lot of this article will help you to broaden your vocabulary as it applies to muscles.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean specifically large skeletal muscles, not smooth muscles. I took a Pharmacy Technician course and one of my teachers was a microbiologist who had worked in the labs at Novartis, she did her theses on cancer and told me why we don't get bicep cancer....and I can't remember why. BUT it has to do with the striations of the muscle, specifically how large skeletal muscles are grown. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
