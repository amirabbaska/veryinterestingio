		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The drip chamber allows IV flow rates to be calculated when an infusion pump is not used (due to unavailability, pump failure, what have you). There is macro tubing which delivers 10, 15, or 20 drops equal to one milliliter, and micro tubing which delivers 60 drops equal to one milliliter. Knowing these ratios helps determine rate of flow. <a href="http://catalogue.marchesehealthcare.ca/wp-content/themes/shopperpress/thumbs/22803.jpg" target="_blank">They're listed on the bag the tubing comes packaged in.</a></p>
<p>Physicians order medications to be delivered at a certain rate per hour. For instance, Normal Saline 0.9% at 125ml/hr for 8 hours. The rate of flow would be calculated by using macro tubing, delivering 10 drops/ml, counting out 20-21 drops a minute.</p>
<p>Practitioners usually use micro drip tubing for pediatric patients, patients who are on fluid restriction, and for medications that require very precise administration. </p>
<p>The amount of air that would accumulate from the gases in IV infusions is not enough to cause harm, and if it does occur, it happens well below the drip chamber when the fluid is warmed with a heating device, which is done when delivering cold fluids like blood. Even then, the amount of gas is very small. On a gravity drip, the chance of a significant air embolism is very small. Infusion pumps have safeguards against air embolisms. The drip chamber doesn't keep air from passing through it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's to control the speed at which the fluid (in this case blood) is inserted into the patient's body. Sometimes the patient needs a lot of fluid in a small amount of times, sometimes the opposite, and all the ratios in between.</p>
<p>The small chamber itself doesn't change the speed, but it's a helpful visual representation of how fast it goes, the speed is controlled by a small metal clip or a plastic contraption with a wheel.</p>
<p>It also acts as a method to avoid air bubbles</p>
<p>Edit: for anyone who wonders why I said &quot;in this case blood&quot;, it's basically because I'm not a native English speaker and I just know the term from the item pool of a game (never actually had that topic in an English conversation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case we go old school or EMS where we have to count drops to calculate how fast the fluid is going in. Different factors affect it like the clamp, size of IV, how high the bag is, etc. Each tubing has a drip factor that is how many drops equal 1 ml. 20 is standard for the alaris pump tubing but there is also 10 and 15. There is also 60 drop factor tubing for infusions that need to be precise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone talking about all this air in the line stuff and there really is nothing to worry about. Most of the time there is an IV pump between you and the bag to control flow. They are set to alarm and stop flow with the slightest detection of any air or an obstruction with very small tolerances. Each pumps accuracy/alarms are checked at least once a year with highly calibrated equipment that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. If something goes wrong it's most likely the nurse or doctor who programmed the rate incorrectly (which is also pretty hard to do on some pumps i.e. PCA pumps that administer narcotics will not let you overdose someone). In the hundreds or even thousands of pumps I've tested I've only seen a couple that the infusion rate was off any more than 3% and maybe 1 or 2 where the alarm went off at a slightly different time than it was supposed to. All of these things are highly controlled and tracked. The pump manufacturers also know what serial numbers are at what facilities and can access their pumps remotely and see every button that was ever pressed. This is all for legal protection so I'd someone dies from a pump failure they can say whether it was the pump or the user or some other cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 ways the chamber can be used : half or full.</p>
<p>With a half chamber priming the bag is usually hung, as seen in hospitals. This method allows you to check , not control ,the rate of IV liquid that goes into your system. This also ensures that any air that comes from bad priming does not enter your bloodstream, which can cause blood to clog and result in stroke.</p>
<p>With a full chamber priming its usually used just as a pathway for the iv liquid to flow and to clear any air bubbles in the iv bag. This is usually used for combat where you cant hang the bag and rely on pressure to keepthe flow going.</p>
