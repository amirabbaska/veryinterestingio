		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm just going to throw this out...gasoline is a specific refinery blend.  Many engines/turbines (the important ones) are run on diesel fuel, natural gas, etc.  Your car runs on gasoline for some specific reasons, but that 16,000 hp engine at the municipal power plant runs on diesel fuel.</p>
<p>But for a vehicle you want energy density, safety, and quick refueling.  For a car, liquid petroleum distillates were discovered early and are great.  You can fill up in 3 minutes.  They aren't that dangerous.  They are a liquid of almost entirely hydrogen-carbon bonds, pretty good energy density.</p>
<p>Lots of alternatives are thrown about.  Hydrogen...hard to store, needs extreme compression for energy density, etc.  Plug in hybrid...heavy batteries with limited lifespan.  Compressed air (yes, every 5-10 years we get a stupid fucking story about Tata making a compressed air car) just unworkable.</p>
<p>Edit:  This may have sounded negative, I'm a huge fan of alternative fuels and actually work in the environmental industry.  It's just that nothing available is as good as gasoline as a general fuel, and there is nothing on the radar which will be.  Yes, a Tesla will blow a comparable gas vehicle off the line in a 1/8 mile, but that doesn't mean it's fully ready for a family that makes $50,000/year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gasoline has a high energy density. Everything else requires larger tanks or more weight for the same amount of power. And gasoline is remarkably stable in liquid form, so it's pretty safe as a fuel. It's cheap. Lastly, there's a lot of infrastructure built for transporting gasoline.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is none of these. Biofuels are are a lot closer to gasoline, but right now, making it eats up arable land and competes with food production, but would be carbon neutral. Batteries are getting better, and a few more generations of incremental improvements will make make using them a more practical choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Abundance.  It’s relatively simple to build combustion engines that run on rubbing alcohol.
But the consumption of gasoline is just shy of a billion gallons a day globally.   The annual alcohol production globally is somewhere around 20 billion gallons a year.  </p>
<p>There’s simply SO much more fossil fuels available and production is so high compared to other fuel choices. </p>
<p>It’s possible to convert a combustion engine to run on any liquid or gas that is flammable. Some work better then others but there isn’t one which is as abundant and convenient.  (Natural gas is close)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two words:  Energy density.  </p>
<p>ELI5:  Gasoline contains more energy per mass (per lb/kg/whatever weight measurement) than any other fuel alternative.  </p>
<p>This means that, per tank of fuel, you can go father that on just about any other fuel source commonly found on Earth.  </p>
<p>Why energy dense?  Because of the number of bonds in the hydrocarbons that makeup gasoline that are broken by combustion, releasing energy.  </p>
<p>Why so difficult to find an alternative fuel source?  Well, oil occurs naturally - so it's relatively easy and cheap to obtain.   Gasoline is distilled from oil - in a relatively straightforward manner.  </p>
<p>In short, it's relatively easy to obtain gasoline from oil and oil is still relatively easy to pump out of the ground.  </p>
<p>No other fuel source is as easily obtainable on Earth.  </p>
<p>Most other fuel sources are either not as energy dense (natural gas) or take as much/more energy to synthesize than you get from burning it in a car engine (making it economically non-viable).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
