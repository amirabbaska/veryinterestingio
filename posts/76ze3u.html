It's where the ambassador is based and is generally located in the different country's capital city. Embassy employees work with the different country's government to represent their own country.</p>
<p>A consulate is like a mini-embassy in other major cities in the different country. Its employees handle minor diplomatic issues like visa requests, passport updates, local business relationships (Company A has business in the country), etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to use my situation as an example here:</p>
<p>Canada has their embassy in Washington DC, which handles all of the official gov't-to-gov't business. They also have a Visa Office that handles all of the minor citizen level stuff: Visas, Passports, etc.</p>
<p>There are also Consulates in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York City, San Fransisco, and Seattle. All of which handle the same Visa office stuff, as well as more US company-to-Canadian Gov't business. They also get involved in Canadian Province Gov't-to-US State Gov't business. Mostly trade related stuff.</p>
<p>The head honcho of a Consulate is called a Consul General, all of which answer to the Ambassador of Canada in Washington DC. There are also Ambassadors of Canada to the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/" target="_blank">OAS</a> and to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">UN</a> both of which are the head of the Permanent Mission of Canada to their respective organization. I mention the OAS and UN because they're both located in the USA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally, embassies were set up to conduct formal diplomatic engagements between nations, while consulates did a lot more work helping the nation's business people abroad. This dichotomy arose as part of the expansion of the merchant republics of the Mediterranean (ie Venice and Genoa). Over time, consulates have become less about business and more about providing embassy services (paperwork, visas, etc) in areas outside of capitals where there are a lot of that particular country's nationals.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers get pretty close, but I'm going to try and clarify a bit further.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As others have said, embassies are the main point of diplomatic contact between the governments of respective nation-states. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases it is not feasible to have an embassy (US in Iran, North Korea, etc.) where the embassies of other countries can be used as diplomatic channels. <del>(The Swiss, in both the above cases)</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embassies provide consular services (immigration, visas, business services, support for a country's citizens overseas, G2B and B2B support). Embassies will regularly host programs and events meant to strengthen business, cultural, and governmental ties between countries. Embassies are NOT strictly government-to-government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consulates provide outposts for foreign governments inside countries, but are not the primary focus of diplomacy between countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That said, consulates DO provide some government-to-government services, especially between larger countries. Japan may use its San Francisco consulate to interact directly with the California governor's office, the Federal Treasury, or the state Department of Transportation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consulates provide consular services just like embassies, stamping passports, providing visas, and offering support for that country's national in case of trouble or disaster.</p>
</li>
<li>Consulates also provide some B2B services, and may interact with local businesses in order to promote that country's businesses/products or to learn about new products from the local market. Larger countries typically have trade promotion agencies that will either piggyback on a consulate's office or establish its own (Like US Department of Commerce or JETRO). </li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr - Embassies are the <em>primary</em> (but not sole) diplomatic point of contact, but both offices offer business, governmental, and cultural services to varying degrees.</p>
