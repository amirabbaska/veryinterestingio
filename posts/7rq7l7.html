Also, doing what you wanna do makes you happy, so if swearing is what you want to do when you are in pain, you will be happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it &quot;feels good&quot;, but when you curse, you're distracting your mind for that split second about whatever pain you're dealing with. It could be an actual curse word, or even, &quot;Oh, bologna!&quot; but the verbal expression lets your mind go on a different track, for even a little. </p>
<p>When you think about the pain and &quot;wtf just happened&quot; type deal, you're focusing about how much it hurts, yeah? So for us, when we want to distract from the mind we outwardly project.</p>
<p>It's a nifty little thing our minds do for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Importantly, it works best when the words you use are taboo. Being forbidden, the words hold more meaning than if they weren’t, which is why “oh fuck” feels better to yell than “oh coffee pot”. (And why people close to you can tell you’re “really serious” when you swear) </p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>If you use the words every day, they lose the effect of being taboo, and are therefore less useful to trigger a stress-relief response in yourself or heightened attention in the people near you. </p>
<p>THAT is why you shouldn’t swear. Unless you really mean it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to note is that every society seems to have something that serves a function akin to our obscenities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursing, [researchers who study the evolution of language and the psychology of swearing] say, is a human universal. Every language, dialect or patois ever studied, whether living or dead, spoken by millions or by a single small tribe, turns out to have its share of forbidden speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Cursing-is-a-normal-function-of-human-language-2567316.php" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>The curse words in question are not identical to our own concept of obscenity, which also includes things like racial slurs, but it seems that every language has some mechanism for using &quot;forbidden words&quot; to express anger. This can manifest itself in a number of ways, but it is always present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Bikol (a language of the Philippines), there’s a special anger vocabulary – many words have alternative words that refer to just the same thing but also mean you’re angry. In Luganda (an African language), you can make a word insulting just by changing its noun class prefix – from a class for persons to a class for certain kinds of objects, for instance. In Japanese, you can insult someone badly just by using an inappropriate form of ‘you’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150306-how-to-swear-around-the-world" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>The fact that every language has some built in &quot;hostility mechanisms&quot; in place suggests that rather than being a cultural construct, swearing is tied to human psychology. Cursing appears to be involved in our brain's reward pathways. Or, as cognitive psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strange emotional power of swearing—as well as the presence of linguistic taboos in all cultures—suggests that taboo words tap into deep and ancient parts of the brain. In general, words have not just a denotation but a connotation: an emotional coloring distinct from what the word literally refers to, as in principled versus stubborn and slender versus scrawny. The difference between a taboo word and its genteel synonyms, such as shit and feces, cunt and vagina, or fucking and making love, is an extreme example of the distinction. Curses provoke a different response than their synonyms in part because connotations and denotation are stored in different parts of the brain</p>
