		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I started watching videos (mostly hour long lecture series on YouTube with lots of talking) in 2x speed a while back. I noticed something weird every time I did so: after finishing the videos or pausing them somewhere in between, I observed that my inner monologue (the voice in my head) is slowed down. For a few moments it felt as though I was listening to audio on a tape recorder with low battery. I also felt a slight lag in my tongue each time as though I suddenly had a thicker tongue. This lasted just for 1-2 minutes after (sometimes not even) and then was back to normal. It would also help if I spoke to myself out loud in normal pace.
I would say I'm kind of used to it now (I've also been listening to podcasts on 2x speed) and it doesn't happen as much anymore. But, I was wondering if this is an effect similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_aftereffect" target="_blank">waterfall effect</a> in vision.</p>
<p>Essentially, sped up audio is causing me to perceive my own audio (?) thoughts slower than usual. Could this be analogous to seeing grainy upward motion after staring at a waterfall (downward motion) for a while? </p>
<p>P.S.: Is this a normal/common experience or am I broken?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About speaking to yourself, I'm not familiar with any such studies. </p>
<p>However, there are auditory motion aftereffects (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03204166" target="_blank">Grantham &amp; Wightman 1979</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03212091.pdf" target="_blank">Dong et al. 2000</a> &lt;- pdf!) where interaural difference can make it seem like a sound is moving left-to-right around your head and you can get aftereffects for subsequently presented sounds.</p>
<p>There are also aftereffects for temporal duration, which may be closer to what you have in mind: after repeatedly hearing a tone of a particular duration, subsequently presented tones seem to last for a shorter amount of time than they actually do (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03207361.pdf" target="_blank">Walker, Irion, &amp; Gordon, 1981</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep10124" target="_blank">Li, Yuan, &amp; Huang, 2015</a>). </p>
<p>Finally, there are aftereffects to changes in volume: after adapting to a gradually loudening tone, subsequent tones will appear to get quieter (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03206201.pdf" target="_blank">Reinhardt-Rutland &amp; Anstis, 1982</a> &lt;-pdf!). Similar effects exist for frequency modulation instead of volume (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-014-0812-2" target="_blank">Alais, Orchard-Mills, &amp; Van der Burg 2015</a>). There are also aftereffects to frequency more generally (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.1972.sp009962/full" target="_blank">Kay &amp; Matthews 1972</a>; <a href="http://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.382792" target="_blank">Regan &amp; Tanley 1979</a>).</p>
<p>So, in short, there are auditory aftereffects similar to the waterfall effect for externally generated sounds. Not really sure how that applies to internally generated speech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
