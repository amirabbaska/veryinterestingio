		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my short experience as a construction worker, I can tell that this type of work is often done in bursts rather than steady progress hence the perception that nothing is ever being done. We can also list a short list of key factors that hamper the speed of the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>weather;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>equipment breakdown;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delivery of materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>labor issues (sickness or shortages);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collisions (i.e. some things cannot be done in the same time);</p>
</li>
<li>delay of prerequisite works.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are doing construction pretty much every element must be in place for the works to progress and quite often unforeseen circumstances make it difficult to execute any plans in time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any road work is split in phases. The previous phase is essential to the ones after it. If one phase is delayed, the one after it is delayed and the effects are cumulative. </p>
<p>You can’t build the roof of a house before the foundation, but you can’t build the foundation without leveling the ground...and so it goes. </p>
<p>It always look like they’re doing nothing because most crew is doing nothing, as they have to wait for those who are working to finish their task in order to start working too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes parts of a job will be labor intensive (like moving objects or fetching a part for a more skilled person) but some parts will require the labor of only one person (someone with higher training doing a specific job). Just because most of the time you don’t need three people doesn’t mean you can cut the other two people because when you need them they must be close. What do you have the other two people do? Mostly stand with a shovel waiting to do their part. </p>
<p>Example: One senior man is driving the road grinder and is doing a great job but he can’t grind up a certain patch of road. Two guys on the ground who have been standing close by jump into action with their shovels and clean up the missed debris. You driving by only got to see the job site for a few seconds and the two guys standing with shovels but not them actually doing physical work.</p>
<p>Second part of your question has to do mostly with inspections. You have to wait for every level of government to check every part of your job (and collect required fees for doing so) before you can move onto the next step. If one thing is wrong you may have to fix the mistake and wait days longer for the inspectors to return and let you move on to the next step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The house next to mine took something like 2-3 years to be completed. The crew would work for 1-3 weeks, then nothing would be done for months at a time. After the foundation had been poured, summer and fall rain collected in it (several inches) and froze during the winter. One could have gone ice skating or played hockey in it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
