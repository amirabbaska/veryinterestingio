<p>Thanks for the help, I'm only a sophomore in high school, but I'm super interested in this kind of science so try not to use to big of words, I think I have a somewhat basic understanding though.</p>
<p>Again, Thanks! :)</p></div></div>

<p>These super-heavy elements won't have applications because they're too short-lived. But they're useful for testing our current theories on nuclear physics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Instead of a half life of milliseconds, these could persist for minutes to hours, though some models predict they could last as long as a few days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are thousands of known nuclides but only hundreds of them are stable. Furthermore, many of them are <strong>highly</strong> unstable, so the only way to study them is to produce them ourselves.</p>
<p>We make them because we're interested in them and we want to understand them. We want to test theories in extreme cases where they're most likely to fail. Because when theories fail to reproduce reality, we learn something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
