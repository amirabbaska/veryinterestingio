		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors here.   Slotted screws are easy to damage if the screwdriver slips or doesn’t fit perfectly.  </p>
<p>Phillips head screws were designed to limit how much torque is applied by “camming out” in the factories before power tools were torque limited. </p>
<p>Now that power drivers are designed with torque limiting clutches the emphasis is on securely fitting the driver without slipping off.  </p>
<p>Everything in engineering is a trade off and screw heads are a perfect example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are claiming that competing standards are the reason. That's not the case. We have different screws drives for different applications, not because of competing standards. In fact union rules have more effect on screw selection than competing standards! </p>
<p>A hexhead does not compete with phillips. A slot head does not compete with pozidrive etc. Admittedly there are some competing standards such as JIS version of Phillips.</p>
<p>Designers pick the drive type based on the application, they consider:</p>
<p>Accessibility, torque limit, cam-out, human or machine driven, tamper resistance, aesthetics, how often its removed, clamp load and unions (not kidding).</p>
<p>A head stud bolt in a car uses a 12 point head because of the high drive torque &amp; accuracy of the torque.</p>
<p>A slot head is common for small applications with minimal torque. It also allows for &quot;tool-less&quot; removal. You don't need a slot screwdriver, you can use a butter knife or a dime etc... </p>
<p>If you think I'm bullshitting on the butter-knife aspect... well I got one more for you:</p>
<p>The big auto manufacturers in the US are all unionized. Union rules determines who does what job. One such rule (paraphrased) is that if certain mechanical tools are required, then a certain union worker must do the work. Example; the heat exchanger for the hydraulic pumps in a big plant requires periodic changeout of the filter. This is done by removing bolts to get to a filter. Bolts require wrenches which means a union maintenance person (millwright maybe?) must do the work.</p>
<p>Eye nuts can be unscrewed with just a bar. Poke it thru the hole of the eye nut and start turning. A simple bar is not a &quot;mechanical tool&quot; and thus now you can use cheap labor and not a union-tradeperson.</p>
<p>Accessibility and aesthetics play a larger role than you'd think. You can't have a flush surface mounted hex head bolt or 12-point. Which is where torx or robertson/square is often used. The torx allows for higher &amp; accurate torque, while robertson/square can rest in the drive bit. You can pickup a robertson/square screw and stick it into your screwdriver, it will stay there. While a torx/phillips/slot will not. This is very important in automation. </p>
<p>DFMA (Boothroyd &amp; Dewhurst) put a lot of emphasis on fastener selection.</p>
<p>The very very last thing is; availability. Designers will skip over everything and just use what McMaster-Carr has available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great answers about the physical / market aspect of this question, but there's at least one other reason:</p>
<p>Sometimes the person installing screws <em>does not want</em> just anyone to be able to remove them. A property management company I worked with used a seven-pointed screwbit / screws on all of their work because they didn't want tenants to be able to take the screws out, and they wanted to know if any of them were replaced.</p>
<p>If you look at the screws used in some public restrooms, you'll see a version of this as well. They'll usually be non-symmetrical screwheads that allow them to be screwed in with a regular flathead, but not screwed out. This is intended to reduce vandalism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First there were flat blade screws but theyhas problems with &quot;camming our&quot; damaging the screw in high torque situations. Then Robertson introduced the square head drive for screws and they solved a bunch of issues.  All the rest were attempts to design-around the Robertson patent and none compare favorable to it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who makes a living from assembling things in an industrial environment, there'r even more considerations, and even fewer good choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Slotted screws were cheapest/easiest to make, no longer relevant.</li>
<li>Any &quot;inny&quot; interface will inevitably fill with material in industrial environments and be unusable without first cleaning it.  If the material is corrosive, it will destroy the fastener.  As a result, bolts as fasteners have a distinct advantage.</li>
<li>Torque and failure modes suggests that a fastener with an internal interface like slotted, robertson, or torx will fail at the bit.  A fastener like a bolt will more likely fail within the head of the bolt first, since it has more force being applied in a smaller area.</li>
