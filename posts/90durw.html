		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your retina are &quot;rods&quot; and &quot;cones&quot; that detect light.</p>
<p>Both are spread throughout your retina, but the cones are concentrated more in the middle and they detect colour. The rods are concentrated around the outside and edges and they detect brightness (no colour).</p>
<p>Evolutionary, this makes the center of your vision very good at distinguishing things. One example I like is that this lets us identify colours of forage when we focus on them. We don't need to identify berry colours (and whether they're safe to eat) in our peripheral vision. We have the time to focus on them.</p>
<p>In our peripherals, colour doesn't matter. We don't need to identify things, we just need to be alerted that they're there. Rods are great for this. They detect light level, so anything that changes and affects the brightness of the light reaching our eyes will be detectable. The main evolutionary purpose of this is likely to alert us of danger. If a threat is approaching from your peripheral, you don't need to know what colour it is, you just need to reliably see it. Threats typically come from the side or behind. Just recently the was a TIL about tiger attacks dropping off after masks were distributed to wear on the backs of heads. Many predators have evolved to attack from behind so as to not alert their prey.</p>
<p>The rod and cone distribution helps and hurts us in the dark. In the dark, colour vision is almost useless, which means your cones aren't helping much. This makes the center of our vision really poor in the dark. Our rods though are able to see the subtle differences in light level, which is very useful in the dark.</p>
<p>We don't typically notice this, because your brain is filling in missing information in your vision all the time. Even when you can't see colours well in your peripheral, you might have a few cones picking them up, and your brain sort of extrapolates that information by saying &quot;If that's blue, then the rest of it is probably blue too.&quot; Your brain is effectively taking inventory of all your vision data and using it to fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>If you sit and focus, you might notice that your peripheral vision doesn't have much colour detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI-ROTC, this is basically how they taught me, and all other kids, by military NCOs.</p>
<p>Your eyes have two types of sensors: rods and cones. Rods are better at seeing in the dark, but only in black and white. OTOH, cones can see colors but don't work so well in the dark.</p>
<p>You have more rods around the edges, so you are better at &quot;just seeing&quot; with your peripheral vision. Also, because there is a certain level of brightness that is too dark to see with cones, but enough for rods, you sometimes see less color in the dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of cells in your retina that detect light, rod and cone cells. Cone cells are concentrated in the centre of your retina and rod cells are more around the outside i.e your peripheral vision is through your rod cells. When you see your nerves are sending signals to your brain, however to avoid sensing absolutely everything and overloading your brain with information a stimulus has to be strong enough to set off an action potential before a message is sent. Cone cells are each connected to their own neurone so require a larger stimulus to send a signal so do not work as well in low light but have higher resolution, several rod cells are connected to one neurone so the signals add up, meaning a smaller signal can set off a message and rod cells work better in low light, however this means lower resolution. Also while not relevant to your question cone cells see colour and rod cells see black and white. So this is why in low light levels you see better on your peripheral, have slightly worse sight in general, and donâ€™t see colour as much, as in low light you rely more on your rod cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
