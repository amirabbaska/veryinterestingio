<p>We have learned to rely more on visual stimuli than on tactile so in the brain visual stimuli is superior. That means that if we kiss with our eyes open what we see will be at the center of our attention rather than the subtle feeling of kissing. If we close our eyes on the other hand it's a lot easier to focus on the kiss.
You can try this on your own. Have someone kiss an area on your back. You won't feel much. Then close your eyes and try again, the feeling will be more intense ... </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not an answered question, although there are answers for <em>similar</em> questions, which you've gotten many of here.^1</p>
<p>To say it's innate means it happens on its own and automatically. Many people here are saying it's because your brain can't handle the stimuli of both the kiss and visualization.</p>
<p>However, that does not make the act of closing your eyes innate. For many people, myself included, it feels more natural leave the eyes open.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca0na8NrOhs" target="_blank">monkeys do not necessarily close their eyes while kissing.</a> </p>
<p>So my guess is that it's not innate because it's not universal, but I don't have a hard-and-fast study to back this up.</p>
<p>1: In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman points out that when faced with a question we can't answer, we often substitute a similar yet easier question <em>without realizing it.</em> For example, if we can't answer the question, &quot;is this behavior innate?&quot; we may instead answer the question, &quot;is this behavior influenced by some biological limitation which makes the result of closing our eyes more likely?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's awkward to stare someone in the eye while you suck on their mouthparts, which is what it becomes if your eyes are open.</p>
<p>Also, my understanding is that kissing is thought to be an entirely learned behavior for modern humans, despite some evolutionary basis for the practice.  But those explanations (kissing was about pre-chewing tough food for infants and grew into a sign of affection by representing this maternal behavior) still revolve around the kissing <em>symbolizing</em> something, so I would classify it as a cultural trait rather than some sort of innate behavior like sneezing or seeking valuable nutrients in food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to close our eyes any time we are really enjoying a sensation. A spoonful of delicious ice cream, a juicy cut of steak, etc. It helps us by eliminating other input and allowing the brain to focus on the enjoyable sensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever smelled something. Like really, really smelled something? What did you do? You closed your eyes, leaned back, and probably let out a big sigh after.</p>
<p>When we do things, especially sensory things, we use body language to express what we are doing, even if doing so doesn't really help us achieve the task. We close our eyes when we use the other parts of the face so we can focus on what we are doing and ignore everything else.</p>
<p>Also try kissing with your eyes open sometime. It's kinda fun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
