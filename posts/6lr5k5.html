		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a a picture of what scientists think the ocean currents likely looked like: <a href="http://imgur.com/geHb0nR" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/geHb0nR</a></p>
<p>I would imagine the wind patterns would be similar to what we see now days (westerlies and trade winds) but perhaps slightly shifted in latitude due to the warmer climate.</p>
<p>I also believe at this time there was no deep water formation. Deep water formation occurs in two major regions in the ocean:</p>
<p>1) In the North Atlantic where warm and very saline water moves north very quickly in the Gulf Stream and sinks as it cools at higher latitudes. The presence of the Gulf Stream is due to the ithsmus of Panama existing, not present in Pangea.</p>
<p>2) In the Southern Ocean,during sea ice formation in the winter months a brine forms as salts in seawater does not fit well into the ice crystal lattice. This brine is heavier than surrounding non-frozen seawater, causing it to sink. This also was likely not happening in the warmer climates</p>
<p>This result in an anoxic ocean at depth, zero oxygen below ~1000 - 500 m, high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide at depth. It is possible there was a small degree of deep water formation at the equator due to extremely high evaporation rates producing very saline waters of higher density. But there would likely not penetrate very deep, leaving a large portion of the ocean anoxic.</p>
<p>Edit: Clarified my statement of #2 deepwater formation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this question! I'd never considered it before and the responses have been very informative and interesting. This topic got me looking at maps of Pangaea and how the continents eventually separated via the continental drift of the tectonic plates. Which got me thinking: If the continents keep moving around like this, will we get any supercontinents in the future? </p>
<p>Did a quick wiki search and looks like there's already been a decent amount of research/speculation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supercontinents#Future_.28speculative.29" target="_blank">the matter</a>. Kind of neat to see where things might be headed millions of years from now.</p>
<p>Kind of puts everything into prospective a little bit. No matter how much we pollute and destroy the planet, we're only doing it to ourselves (and our cohabitants). the Earth itself will be here long after we poison ourselves off of this rock. It's just going to keep doing its thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fantastic BBC documentary called &quot;Rise of the Continents&quot;, goes very in depth at the rise and fall of Pangea and the formation of our modern geography, weather and erosion play a huge part.</p>
<p>The process that led to the formation of the Himalayas was one of the most devastating events in earths history. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Throw in the possibilityâ€‹ of a 50 foot swell with a period of 30 seconds from the northeast hitting the north facing coast colliding with another equally large swell coming from the northwest. There could easily be 200' waves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
