<p>Alice in wonderland syndrome.</p>
<p>I'm not sure my exact age at the time but I was around 9 or 10. I was laying stomach down on the brown velvety living room couch facing out with my left cheek to couch. Must have been attempting to nap.</p>
<p>I was staring at the opposite wall where the room corner meets the ceiling and all of a sudden I felt myself shrink down to doll size. The room became bigger and bigger and I didn't move any part of my body except my eyes to look around the room. The depth and size of the objects in the room kept adjusting and readjusting to various proportions. </p>
<p>I was so young I didn't understand the disorientation should be alarming and I felt like I could control the swing of becoming smaller and then normal size and then abnormally larger. I remember feeling like I was &quot;in&quot; the carpet like I was insect size. The sounds from around the house (like my grandma cooking in the nearby kitchen) seemed to ebb and flow per the appropriate &quot;size&quot; I was or distance I was away. I vaguely recall being able to recreate the experience only one more time but trying over and over to do so because I enjoyed the feeling so much.</p>
<p>I only learned what this is called about 2 years ago. Until then I kept it to myself because I thought I may have dreamed it or made it up in my childish recollection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of people pointed out that it's called 'Alice in Wonderland Syndrome' but haven't said why it happens, so I did some digging. It turns out that nobody (at least according to papers published up to 2016) knows the exact cause; however, a doctor put someone in a scanner during an attack and saw abnormal blood flow in parts of the brain that process vision, texture, size, and shape. They didn't say what the scanner was, so I'm assuming an MRI. This is from an article done by ABC news, so take it with a grain of salt. source: <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/Primetime/story?id=3581479&page=1" target="_blank">http://a.abcnews.com/Primetime/story?id=3581479&page=1</a></p>
<p>It seems to happen to children randomly. It's also linked to a lack of sleep or sometimes experienced as you're going to sleep. Less benign causes are as an early symptom of the Epstein-Barr virus (mono), migraines, tumors, temporal lobe epillepsy, and hallucinogenic drugs.</p>
<p>For people experiencing AIWS with no underlying cause, rest and dietary change are usually prescribed to prevent symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
