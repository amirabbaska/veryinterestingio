		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TIL about Ivan Pigarev's <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283492881_The_state_of_sleep_and_the_current_brain_paradigm" target="_blank">&quot;visceral&quot; theory of sleep</a>. Basically it states that sleep is required to switch the brain from processing of data from external sensors (eyes, ears etc.) to internal ones, like receptors in intestines, and do the adjustments accordingly. In his works he shows that if one stimulates e.g. the intestine of a sleeping animal it causes the response in visual cortex which is very similar to the response to flickers of light during the day, whilst there is no such response in waking state. He states that they conducted hundreds of experiments on animals in support of the view.</p>
<p>This was completely new to me (which is to no surprise, I'm quite illiterate in neurophysiology) and I'm fascinated by the idea. The first thing I did is checked if his works are legit and if he has publications in respectable magazines, which he seem to have. He also doesn't look like a usual &quot;science freak&quot; which are plenty around here. However, I tried to google some popular articles in English about that but haven't found much.</p>
<p>So I want to know if this view is known to Western scientists and if yes what is the common opinion on that? Community's opinion on the matter would be also great to hear!</p></div></div>
