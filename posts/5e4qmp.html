		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TIL about Ivan Pigarev's <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283492881_The_state_of_sleep_and_the_current_brain_paradigm" target="_blank">&quot;visceral&quot; theory of sleep</a>. Basically it states that sleep is required to switch the brain from processing of data from external sensors (eyes, ears etc.) to internal ones, like receptors in intestines, and do the adjustments accordingly. In his works he shows that if one stimulates e.g. the intestine of a sleeping animal it causes the response in visual cortex which is very similar to the response to flickers of light during the day, whilst there is no such response in waking state. He states that they conducted hundreds of experiments on animals in support of the view.</p>
<p>This was completely new to me (which is to no surprise, I'm quite illiterate in neurophysiology) and I'm fascinated by the idea. The first thing I did is checked if his works are legit and if he has publications in respectable magazines, which he seem to have. He also doesn't look like a usual &quot;science freak&quot; which are plenty around here. However, I tried to google some popular articles in English about that but haven't found much.</p>
<p>So I want to know if this view is known to Western scientists and if yes what is the common opinion on that? Community's opinion on the matter would be also great to hear!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a theory I hadn't heard of before, and it very well could be a partial function of sleep, but I doubt it's the full story. Current theory believes sleep is necessary for consolidation of memory, particularly alleviating metabolic burden produced during awake activity.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say that this is not a commonly accepted theory in western neuroscience. As stated above, the current most accepted theory is that sleep above all aids in memory consolidation, metabolic rest, etc. </p>
<p>To say that the brain &quot;switches&quot; from processing external stimuli during the day to internal stimuli when sleeping does not fit well with our current understanding of the nervous system because we are, in fact, constantly processing internal stimuli during the day. Ever felt hungry? Ever felt thirsty? These are examples where internal conditions (e.g. Dehydration) are processed by various parts of the brain (think hypothalamus the internal &quot;regulator&quot; among other things) constantly during the day. </p>
<p>On top of this, we DO process external stimuli during sleep. A prime examples of this are experiments that test the threshold for waking someone up from sleep. When presented with names when sleeping, studies show that a subject will have a lower awakening threshold when they hear relevant words (ex. A name that is relevant to them vs a name that is not). This shows that there is external stimuli processing during sleep. </p>
<p>TL;DR: This is not a commonly accepted theory for sleep. There is no &quot;switch&quot;, we process both internal and external stimuli constantly throughout the day/night. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The study is behind a paywall so I can't see how it was conducted, but studies that look into brain activity and form a conclusion are in most cases are not very conclusive and have a high rate of false positives.  Just because the visual cortex is active during sleep it does not necessarily correlate to the brain focusing on internal organs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(Older paper, but a lot of the research of the first author and others in the field since then support that hypothesis. If you want to know about sleep, I suggest that you look into the work of Dr. Julio Tononi) </p>
<p>It is likely that (slow-wave) sleep plays an important role in synaptic downscaling. During the day as we are learning new things, a lot of long term potentiation (LTP) is occurring (synaptic strengthening among other things, believed to be the cellular mechanism of learning, etc). However, there needs to be something that resets the baseline of brain functioning; if there wasn't, then LTP would run wild until all synapses were at maximal strength and there wouldn't be any room left for learning/plasticity (oversimplification). This is where synaptic downscaling comes in. Slow wave sleep might 'reset' the brain to be able to learn new information by weakening synapses until the average synaptic strength is at a baseline level. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all: how is no one commenting on what this paper is actually is about? It's not about sleep: it's a suggestion that we are fundamentally misunderstanding how the brain works.</p>
<p>Secondly, why is no one discussing the source? Frontiers Media have been known to publish weird shit. They ended up on Jeffrey Beall's list of predatory journals for a reason. It's an eclectic mix of solid material from reputable researchers, and fringe science.</p>
<p>From reading Pigarev's article, I'm at first surprised at how informal it is. This is not how standard articles in the field are written, which makes me suspect he's on the &quot;fringe&quot; side.</p>
<p>Reading on, I get the impression he's totally disconnected from the neuroscientific community. He writes about the idea of the cerebral cortex running a universal algorithm without mentioning Vernon Mountcastle. And he's basically only referring to his own experiments. He's a lone wolf who believes he's made a revolutionary breakthrough.</p>
<p>And his English is really bad.</p>
<p>He's claiming interoceptive signals are blocked during wakefulness. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3999437/" target="_blank">Uh, hello, the anterior insula?</a></p>
<p>Here's how he ends his article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis of the history of science development led the founder of the science paradigm ideology Kuhn (1962) to very sorrowful conclusion. He wrote that any new scientific paradigms become considered only by the next generation of scientists. So, we are looking with hope on young scientists coming to work in System Neuroscience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, Pigarev.</p>
<p>I'm honestly getting the sense that he's delusional. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
