		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, the idea that EVERYONE should vote is extremely new. Today, we think of voting restrictions as being intended as a way of making sure certain parts of society didn't get a say out of spite or elitism, but in reality, it was much more an attempt to solve a problem that we still suffer from today: Most people don't really know what they're voting for.</p>
<p>By restricting voting to landowners, the idea was that voters would not only be more likely to have the education necessary to understand what their vote meant, but also had a vested interest in the long term success of the nation (or state, or county, or whatever). The idea was that if you owned property in the place you were voting, you would vote for things that would lead to the success of the place as a whole, so the value of your land would go up, your farm would succeed, etc. If you were just some guy working odd jobs, you were more likely to vote for the guy who offered you free food and money until the whole economy tanked, then up and leave when it went south.</p>
<p>This isn't as wrongheaded as it may seem at first blush. A decade ago, many South American countries elected very far left politicians who essentially took the position of &quot;We'll just give the poor people who voted for us free stuff&quot;. Brazil's Lula, for example, was elected largely by uneducated or undereducated poor people, who he then pandered to by constantly giving them things for free. While he was extremely, extremely popular at the time, the end result was that he took Brazil from having overflowing coffers to being buried in debt, contributing massively to Brazil's current economic situation.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don't mean that to say &quot;Only rich people should vote&quot;. But allowing everyone to vote does have some trade offs.</p>
<p>Anyway, to the point of the question, it wasn't until very recently that women were allowed to own land or get a very good education. So, in the context of the views of the time, not allowing women to vote actually made a great deal of sense. If you want to restrict voting to educated people with a vested interest in the long term success of the area (in this context, landholders), then women of the time genuinely rarely met the requirements.</p>
<p>Ultimately, women not having the right to vote until the 20th century wasn't necessarily always specifically sexist in and of itself, but rather the result of other forms of sexism. The whole thing is fairly convoluted when you get into it.</p>
<p>Edit: A word</p>
<p>Edit 2: Just wanted to clarify a couple things. Apologies for the really long edit, but numerous people have responded to me making basically the same couple points, so I figured I'd address them here instead of just saying the same thing over and over individually.</p>
<p>First, Regarding former Brazilian President Lula, I certainly don't believe he was all bad. The poor in Brazil have it extremely bad, and Lula's predecessor Cardoso probably focused too much on long-term economic growth and big picture, and not enough on helping the people here and now. As can be seen in the American midwest, rustbelt, and inner cities, ignoring people who need help now in favor of making it better for everyone isn't a perfect plan. However, Cardoso did manage to create an economically stable state, which set Lula up a good situation for Lula to implement much-needed reforms. However, he tried to do too much too fast. Brazil's economy was booming, and he dove head first into creating tons of assistance programs, pensions, etc., which helped millions of people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was all contingent on Brazil's economic boom continuing. When commodity prices started dropping and oil started bottoming out, Brazil's money well dried up, but government spending didn't diminish. The aid and reform programs continued on, but now without any way to fund it. Rousseff probably had time to stop it, but instead she burned everything to the ground. Now most of those people Lula temporarily helped are in as bad or worse situations than they were before. Ultimately, he broke a very simple economic rule for governments: Save during boom years, spend during bust years.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't to say everything Lula did was bad. Helping the poor is something that Brazil needed for a long time, and still needs a great deal of. My point was, his electorate didn't want a better situation in 5, 10, or 15 years. They wanted a better situation right now, and he gave it to them. Now that's gone, because by giving them what they wanted when they wanted it, he created an unsustainable economic situation.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the beliefs that I'm promoting restricting voting to rich landowners, I absolutely am not. I didn't address the issues with only landowners voting because that wasn't the point of my post. I was providing context, with a modern example, for the problem those voting restrictions were trying to solve, and the role they had in why women couldn't vote, as was the question asked by OP.</p>
<p>The fact is, many people, regardless of economic class, gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other differentiation, probably don't make very good voting decisions. My personal opinion, since it's being assumed quite a bit, is that ideally, we WOULD restrict voting to qualified people. However, I've yet to learn about or think of any system of voter restriction that would prevent people who don't have the ability (for whatever reason) to vote responsibly and intelligently while allowing all the people who do. There are vast numbers of issues poor people face, for example, that wealthy and middle class people have absolutely no knowledge of, so obviously poor people DO need to be able to vote.</p>
<p>As far as I see it, allowing everyone to vote creates fewer problems than restricting voting in a flawed way. Allowing everyone to vote is much like democracy itself: Extremely flawed and riddled with countless problems from beginning to end, but unfortunately the best form of government we've been able to come up with so far. </p>
<p>I hope this all lends some clarity to what I'd intended to be a bit of context for an answer regarding why women couldn't vote for so long. Thanks for reading, if you've read this far.</p>
<p>Edit 3: I thought I'd do a third edit here to say that my summary of Brazil's economic situation is EXTREMELY simplified. There's no possible way to thorough discuss the economy of an entire nation in a standard sized book, let alone a couple paragraphs on Reddit. Combine this with the facts that it's impossible to accurately gauge why and how an economic situation came to be until at least several decades later and that I am not, and would never pretend to be, an expert on Brazilian economics (although I've done my share of research into it, and have discussed it with a Brazilian economist whose views and opinions I regard extremely highly), and you're going to get a cursory summary that doesn't take into account nearly all the minor details. Lula had, and continues to have, millions of very intelligent, well-read supporters. I happen to disagree with them, no disrespect intended.</p>
<p>Edit 4: I'm never sure if it's appropriate to make an edit when someone gives you gold, but I didn't do it the one other time someone was so generous and I felt like a giant ungrateful dick. Thank you for for the gold, anonymous gilder, sincerely! Also, if whoever gilded that other post reads this, thank you belatedly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the 'arguments against' (or reasons why it wasn't happening) I had read up on was that nobody could really comprehend how a married couple (2 becoming 1 unit) would have two different votes. Think of it as '1 vote for 1 unit'. So why double the paperwork for no point. Husbands were seen as being responsible for the doing of the task. Indeed, to mount a horse or strap on boots regardless of weather and go do 'their vote'. The household vote. </p>
<p>I'm going a bit by fading memory but a basic 'argument against' related to that first one was 'anti-elitist' and worried about the wealthy upper-classes taking over. So they assume a couple will be voting the same. Now, (re: husbands obligation to carry out physical task) and now you've doubled the possible votes. However, this is highly inconvenient to households of lesser means. poor to middle-class homes where the mother and grandmother simply cannot easily travel out on windy rainy nights days and leave children behind (or take them). ....  however ..... this was NOT as much the practical issue for wealthy upper-classes who had maids and nannies and the ability to take covered coaches and escorts and stay in hotels if need be etc.</p>
<p>so what they feared was basically the middle-poor folks can still only send the husband to cast the vote on behalf of the couple. The 1 vote for the 1 household/couple but the wealthy could basically double their votes with easy access and practical ability. </p>
<p>There was also an 'argument against' or opposition from what were the 'social liberals' of the days in the Western democracies as women were, at that time, considered the stricter religious morally superior of the sexes. In one book I was reading about a US debate it was almost hilarious how the strictest opponents to women voting were funded by and made of: The local saloon owners, the local whorehouse owners/staff/regulars, the local casino, the local boxing organizers. Basically, they were well certain that if wives (their 'enemies' if you will) get the vote then they'd instantly start making alcohol/prostitutes/gambling/sports etc illegal overnight. </p>
<p>I think there was another issue about war or wartime or post-war but something to the effect of consequences if and when significant numbers of men were at war and/or killed in wars but i forgot what the deal was on it.</p>
<p>Today we probably can't see these things anymore. People don't become married at 18 as much. People today can't believe a married couple (married... merged together) means merged/married together into one unit. Its normal to think they'd work to different political goals. That in the olde days people really had to brave outdoor weather, the crowds and dangers to go vote. Not just have the wife stop somewhere on a drive home and keep the babysitter for an extra hour at the most inconvenience. Or that women and in particular the 'women's movement' used to be an extreme right-wing Christian conservative movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a great response to why Queen Victoria didn't like feminists over at /r/askhistorians, which you can find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5qvm8e/was_queen_victoria_reacting_to_a_specific_group/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's worth reading the whole comment, but the tl;dr is that Queen Victoria maintained a lot of her power and influence by maintaining a public image of her as a proper lady. She emphasized her motherhood (mother to princes, mother to an empire, etc.) and family life to keep her firmly in the mainstream and feminism was a threat to the power of that image. That's not a direct response to why it took until 1918 for women to be able to vote, but it at least shows why Queen Victoria wouldn't have been helping feminism move forward. </p>
<p>As for why 1918 and not a little earlier or later, the main reason was WW1. A lot of men were fighting on the front and women filled in for their jobs at home. As a result, women became seen as more capable. Right after the war, Parliament passed a voting law that got rid of a lot of previous requirements for men (only about 60% of males over 21 could vote prior to 1918 and many men returning from the war did not meet the requirements, which was not politically popular) and it gave some women the right to vote (over 30, with some property and education requirements). The full right for women to vote came in 1928.</p>
<p>There's a lot more history to the suffrage movement in the UK that lead up to the passage of those bills, but that's probably best saved for another post. </p>
<p>Edit: We get it guys - poor men and men of color have historically been disenfranchised too, but that doesn't really have much to do with the question of why no women were allowed to vote in the UK when its ruler was female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I read a book about political philosophy from I believe the 1840s if I remember right, and the author brought up the subject of women voting. He said that intellectually he couldn't think of a reason why women should not vote, but that the man was head of the household and that he wouldn't want to introduce strife over voting between a married couple. He entertained the thought then that unmarried women might be allowed to vote, but said that that would benefit only widows and young unmarried women, and that he would not wish to encourage the latter to remain unmarried. Therefore, he said he was against expanding the franchise to women.</p>
<p>You will find that many 19th century (and earlier) arguments around giving various rights to women often didn't center around their intellectual abilities, but around gender and household roles. Sure, you find plenty of male authors of the time period who we would now label as misogynistic (believing women were natural inferiors, etc) but that wasn't necessarily a given. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its important to note that Queen Victoria did <em>not</em> rule, but rather reigned. She was a figurehead not at all unlike the current royal family in the name of which a popularly elected Parliament forms a government. The remainder of the eligible aristocracy can participate in politics in the Upper Chamber of Parliament (the House of Lords), but the Monarch is relegated to advising the Prime Minister as to the policy the Monarch prefers.</p>
<p>Although the opinions and views of the Monarch are influential, the Monarchs themselves cannot implement any policy either foreign, domestic or imperial/commonwealth. The Monarch does retain the power of Royal Assent (which is sort of a veto in reverse, rather than rejecting legislation the Monarch refuses to agree to it), but it is almost never withheld in contemporary UK politics out of respect for the democratic process necessary to pass a bill through both chambers successfully.</p>
<p>I realize this doesn't answer your question, but despite being the titular Empress of India, Queen Victoria had almost no say in the practical administration of its government (she never even visited India) outside advising the PM who could - if he chose - pass that advise on to the foreign office or the Governor/Viceroy of India. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
