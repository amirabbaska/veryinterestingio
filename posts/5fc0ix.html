		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make a long story short, they are just not good enough (yet?) for most applications. More to the point, they are not as good as the current king of the PV market, namely crystalline-Si solar cells. To see better what I mean, we can look at three key areas of PV performance. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency.</strong> Take a look at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wVCsSQ6.jpg" target="_blank">this chart</a> showing the efficiency of various PV technologies. Organic solar cells are shown in solid red circles. As you can see over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency of these cells has slowly crept up, topping up just over 10%. If you tried to make commercial modules out of these cells, the efficiency would be below 10%. Now compare that to silicon, where lab-grade cells reach 25% and even commercial modules hover around 20%. It's simply not clear at this moment whether organic solar cell will ever get much better than 10%, giving Si cells a strong leg up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability.</strong> The ideal solar cell is one that you could stick on your roof (or in a solar park) and it will keep cranking out power for decades. Silicon solar cells are pretty damn solid in this regard, often showing little degradation even after years and years of use. Organics on the other hand tend to be quite a bit more flimsy, with the efficiency slowly drooping as the organic compounds degrade. The problem can be solved in part by using more stable active materials and encapsulating the cells, but it's not clear what the best case scenario is.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost.</strong> One of the key reasons people started investigating organic solar cells is because crystalline silicon was so expensive. That logic has changed drastically in recent years. As the production volume of crystalline silicon rose, the price plummeted <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eHJPpcn.png" target="_blank">as shown in this graph</a>. In some sense, that shouldn't have been too shocking. Silicon is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale" target="_blank">economies of scale</a> are very much real. As a result, the cost of the silicon is becoming an increasingly smaller share of the total price of a solar cell. Moreover, the best organic cells use rather complex active materials that require many synthetic steps that drive the price up. As a result, it's becoming less and less clear whether organics can potentially offer a significant reduction in cost compared to silicon cells. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great answer from crnaruka who hit the major points.</p>
<p>One more thing to add about the cost:  A large fraction of the cost of a solar cell is now the &quot;balance of systems&quot; costs.  This includes the glass for encapsulating the cell, the metal supports for the panel, the installation costs of the panel, and the supporting circuitry to convert the electricity to the proper type and voltage.</p>
<p>These costs are fairly similar for each technology and are roughly proportional to the cell area.  Therefore, increases in efficiency (more power per area) decreases how much you need to spend on these balance of systems costs.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is an example called the &quot;free wafer&quot; problem, which goes:</p>
<p>If someone gave you a functioning solar cell device for free, how efficient would it need to be to be cheaper than current solar costs if you still needed to pay all of the balance of systems costs?</p>
<p>The answer depends on your assumptions, but the number I have heard is ~12% efficiency.  So even if organic solar cells are incredibly cheap, they need to be at least that efficient to compete.  Perovskite solar cells can reach these efficiencies, but they have incredibly poor stability as of now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really nice discussion!
There was the point of cost and that they are cheap or often proclaimed to be cheap in front of the public or the investors. That's only partly true! What the companies often mean is, that the production(!) method is cheap, since only printing and coating methods can be used on a slightly modified printing machine. There is no magic behind.
The cost comes with the material, which often cost up to 2500$/gr for the best performing ones. The problem is, you can't buy some in large-scale! You might not need much (some hundred nm thickness), but just to start up a roll-to-roll machine requires some hundred milliliter with several grams of material in it.
The barrier foil and glue are also very(!) expensive and are actually the real cost driver for large-area OPVs.</p>
<p>The only available commercial OPVs are from www.Heliatek.com and www.Solarte.de (belectric OPV, former Konarka), but they only to business-to-business, so you can't find out the price (even asking them reveals no info) Demo installations exist, look good, but only they know how expensive they are. These companies living from EU/state funding and some investors.
But then there is also a Danish company called infinityPV (www.infinityPV.com) and they actually sell OPV to the public and you can see the price. They also made an OPV solar charger. It looks like they also sell ready-made ink (also with prices!) for industry in large volumes.</p>
<p>There is still a long time until prices go down, but limiter is the barrier foil and a bit the materials in it.  Anyway, they will never replace Si rooftop PV installations. They are intended for niche applications (portable chargers etc.) maybe IoT applications, maybe some architectural things, but never ever a long-lived large-scale power source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
