		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I Drank 1 liter of heavy water once. Followed by daily intake of 200 ml of heavy water.</p>
<p>The reason why I did this was for an medical experiment I was participating. They used this to track the turnover of T1 helper cells (involved in immune response). The idea that new T1 cells would incorporate some of the deuterium in their DNA.</p>
<p>What happened was that I got massive vertigo and got sick (threw up). The reason of this was the change of weight in the fluids in the balance organ. At least that's what they told me. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception</a></p>
<p>After a couple of hours everything was ok again and I even went skiing that evening. </p>
<p>The following intakes had no effect. </p>
<p>I do remember that I did not like the taste of it. It was different from normal tap water and I got to dislike the taste as I associated it with the vertigo. I believe kinda metallic bitter (this was over 12 years ago, and the details are a bit fuzzy.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only if you drink a lot - toxicity studies find that ~50% of body water needs to be replaced with deuterated water before animals died. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Effect_on_biological_systems" target="_blank">The Wikipedia article on heavy water</a> has a good section on toxicity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experiments in mice, rats, and dogs have shown that a degree of 25% deuteration causes (sometimes irreversible) sterility, because neither gametes nor zygotes can develop. High concentrations of heavy water (90%) rapidly kill fish, tadpoles, flatworms, and Drosophila. Mammals, such as rats, given heavy water to drink die after a week, at a time when their body water approaches about 50% deuteration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No clue what it tastes like, though I might expect no difference. Either way, I wouldn't recommend it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
