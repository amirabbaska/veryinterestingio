		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any arbitrary rotation of such an object can equivalently be described as a rotation about a single axis. Whatever angular velocity vector you can construct in your initial coordinate system, I can pick a coordinate system where one axis lies along that direction. Then the angular velocity has a nonzero component in only one direction.</p>
<p>And the outward centrifugal force in a co-rotating frame points normal to that axis. So it's not uniform in all directions, if that's what you're asking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>However many components you think the sphere's rotation is made up of, imagine setting it down on the floor so that it rolls without changing how it's rotating. It would travel in a single direction, right? Because those separate rotations relative to different axes sum to a simple rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok here's a thought experiment. Suppose you have a rigid sphere. You put three marks on it : two on the equator, about 90 degrees apart, and one on the poles. I claim that no matter how you spin the sphere, you cannot get all three points to have equal centripetal force directed away from the center of the sphere.</p>
<p>Why is this? Well, for each point, the centripetal force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of that point. For the two points on the equator that's easy. Spin the sphere so it rotates on its axis, and the points are moving along a big circle of rotation. The normal force is away from the center of the rotation.</p>
<p>But now how can you simultaneously get the point at the pole to experience the same force? That would mean that point is also moving perpendicular to the direction of the force. The point would have to be moving towards the equator - but we said it's a rigid sphere, so the points can't be moving relative to each other on the surface of the sphere.</p>
<p>You can add all the axes you want, but you can't change the fact that each point on the sphere is only accelerating in one vector at a time. And in a rigid sphere, you'll find you can't get all the points on the sphere to accelerate so that the normal force is outward via rotating the sphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
