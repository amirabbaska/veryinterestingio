		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire is the rapid oxidation of the molecules in the fuel source (i.e. logs in a fireplace).  It is an exothermic reaction which is where the heat comes from.  The energy generated from the oxidation of the atoms excites the electrons in the combustible material.  When the excited electrons fall back down to their ground state, they release photons which is the source of the light that you see (i.e. flames).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say we take a magnifying glass and focus the sun's light on a piece of wood. The focused light &quot;burns&quot; the wood. A little bit of white smoke comes off the wood, and a black mark is left on the wood.</p>
<p>The black dot is essentially a little black dot of charcoal. The white smoke is volatile and flammable compounds. That white smoke is actually what becomes fire.</p>
<p>As those flammable compounds are released from a piece of wood or paper, if they get hot enough, and mix with oxygen from the air, they go through another chemical reaction. They combine with oxygen, turning into carbon dioxide and water, and maybe some other things. This reaction releases a lot of energy, in the form of heat and light. This is what you see as the flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Fun experiment to do to understand this, but don't fire is super dangerous and you might burn down everything,
Take a big cardboard tube (from tinfoil, paper towel, wrapping paper) and light one end. Hold it up straight or diagonally. Be careful!! Use tongs or a glove, it gets hot!!
Smoke will start to come out the top, and it may even spontaneously ignite. The smoke is parts of the tube that became a gas and now are burning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say that you have two tennis balls, one is on the ground, and one is up on a table. The ball on the ground has a low potential energy because it's already on the ground. But the ball on the table has a higher potential energy, because with just one little push, it will fall, releasing energy. So the act of the ball moving from table, to floor, results in a new position (on the floor) and energy. The energy that causes the initial push onto the floor, is the flame. And each ball that drops, drives the flame, pushing more balls on the floor and releasing more energy. </p>
<p>Fire and flames are the result of chemical reactions as atoms re-arrange themselves between high potential states (up on the table) and low potential states + energy (on the floor). </p>
<p>Lets take wood for instance. Wood is made up of minerals, cellulose, water, and other traces. Cellulose is a hydrocarbon meaning it has carbon and hydrogen in long chains. What it's missing is more oxygen, and the energy to help that oxygen form new bonds with the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. </p>
<p>So lets say you start with C6H10O5. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 5 oxygens. You add oxygen from the air, plus heat as an activation energy to &quot;give it a little push&quot;. The oxygen bonds with the carbons forming carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and both reactions release more heat, which keeps the flame going. The oxygen and hydrogen also combine forming dihydrogen oxide aka water. H2O, which also creates energy. Provided the flame doesn't run out of oxygen, all the carbons and hydrogens in the wood get turned into carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water vapor and heat. What's left is ash, which are usually minerals that the tree had absorbed from the soil and ended up in the wood, but it doesn't burn, so it becomes ash. </p>
<p>So you burn the wood, you get carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water. Plants then take the carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and use the power of the sun to re-arrange the carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens, producing more cellulose. Basically plants use solar energy to put the tennis balls back up on the table, storing energy. We know cellulose burns, so in a way the plant is taking solar energy, and storing it as cellulose/chemical energy for later. All it takes to release that energy is a flame (a little push). </p>
<p>An even easier flame is one made of hydrogen gas and oxygen, such as in a rocket engine. You have hydrogen, and a smaller quantity of oxygen and you put them together and add an activation energy in the form of a flame. The hydrogen and oxygen rapidly form H2O water vapor and release heat. So the exhaust of the rocket is pure water. </p>
<p>And then imagine that we re-collect the water in a tank, and use solar energy to split the water molecules back into oxygen and hydrogen. We now have more rocket fuel ready to burn, courtesy of sunlight. This is kind of what plants do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
