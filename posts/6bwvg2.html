		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Demodex is a parasite that is found on humans, and is called mange on dogs. A compromised immune system can cause an infestation, but usually our immune system is strong enough to kill them off before they become a problem. I think this may be a reason for those phantom bugs you feel. My dog had non contagious mange and he almost died before I was able to turn it around for him. He came from an unknown background, and even though I did DNA, I have no clue where all his health issue came from. He is almost full GS and has 17 % Great Dane- he is a handsome boy! Anyway that is how I learned about demodex.
