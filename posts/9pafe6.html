That does not mean they can't be creative or can't have great imagination, but mental recall of images or visualization of images just is not an universal ability. I'm partially affected, but in my case it only seems to include faces. Can't recall/imagine faces at all. It's particularly disheartening when I'm remembering my old dog or any of my friends or relatives that have passed on, and I'm trying my hardest to call up an image of what they looked like....yet there's nothing more than a fuzzy blur. All I've got is old photographs.... Heck, I can't even visualize an image of my wife's face, and we've been married for a decade and she's sitting right next to me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many visualisations are remixed/melded visuals you already know. Imagine a chocolate cat. You can do it by a mash up of two visual images you already know. </p>
<p>Now try to imagine an abstract thing like time. You end up using visual representations that you already know such as graphs or arrows. </p>
<p>You have never seen either but one is easier to imagine as itâ€™s a potentially real thing in the world not some abstract. </p>
<p>That said dome people see colours and shapes to sounds and ideas and that might be an interesting clue to how things happen. But you could get a PhD on this subject. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>how are we able to clearly visualize images</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, how do you know that's what's really happening in the first place? Human brains are <strong>excellent</strong> at lying to ourselves.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I ask you to &quot;fully visualize&quot; a pirate. Done?</p>
<p>Okay, was the pirate's right index finger regular, scarred, with a ring, or missing? Was his palm towards you or away from you? </p>
<p>I think you'll realize you probably didn't &quot;visualize&quot; (like a camera) those &quot;in plain sight&quot; details of the pirate <em>at all</em> until something  triggered your attention towards the  gap. At best it was filled in with an <em>idea</em> about a hand (or hook.)</p>
<p>We don't create pictures in our heads, we choose impressions, emotions, requirements, and stories. When you are drawing a real picture (or being asked questions) you use those to invent details as needed and to cross-check shapes you re-notice. </p>
<p>Most of the time it's all automatic, and the work of choosing fresh details <em>feels</em> like remembering old details we &quot;saw earlier.&quot; This is appropriate, because experiments prove a huge portion of what humans &quot;remember&quot; is actually just our brain making shit up too.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> You probably don't, you just think you do, because humans are crazy meatbags.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found it interesting recently that I can create images in my mind of imaginary people I have definitely never met before including detailed faces and all their mannerisms. No doubt an amalgamation of different people i have met but still an impressive mental feat. Not that I think I'm special - it never occurred to me that I might be unique in this but now I'm wondering now how common it actually is.</p>
<p>I also often dream very vividly of non-existant, imaginary people with full personalities and particular mannerisms.</p>
<p>From a scientific perspective, it is amazing that the mind has this capability. I guess creative people like authors and artists do this all the time.</p>
<p>Can you also do this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
