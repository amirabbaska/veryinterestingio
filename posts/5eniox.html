		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Table salt is composed of two ions, Sodium (Na+) and Chloride (Cl-).</p>
<p>Sodium is easily absorbed by the body through rapid uptake, and it also tends to pull water along with it, by action of osmosis. The body uses Na+ for exciting cells, and also to regulate blood pressure by adjusting how much water is present in the body.</p>
<p>The easiest way for water to move around is with Na+, because it's the most abundant ion in the body. Eating too much salt will increase the amount of Na+ in your body, and that also increases the water absorption, which enters your blood and increases the circulating fluid. This increase in fluid occupies more space, which exerts pressure on the sides of your blood vessel, translating to an increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Your kidneys will eventually get rid of the extra sodium, but sometimes, for reasons not very clear, the body decides to keep retaining sodium instead, which leads to high blood pressure. Hence why you're advised to limit salt intake if you're suffering from blood pressure problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll just note that a lot of recent research suggests that sodium doesn't increase blood pressure as much as previously thought. Very high doses of salt (&gt;24g per day) do appear to cause high BP, but in the normal range (6-16g) there doesn't appear to be much correlation for most people.</p>
<p>For example in one large scale <a href="http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/03/ajh.hpu164" target="_blank">study</a> found:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was no correlation between salt intake and blood pressure in women.</li>
<li>There was a correlation in men. Men with normal BP could have low or high salt intake, but men with high blood pressure were more likely to have high salt intake. This suggests that salt affects different people differently.</li>
<li>Not eating fruits and vegetables was correlated with high BP in both sexes.</li>
<li>Alcohol intake correlated with high BP in both sexes</li>
<li>There was no correlation with physical activity an BP.</li>
<li>Age and body mass index were the two most important factors in high BP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course since having <a href="https://trulink.spacelabshealthcare.com/pdf/Rectangular-cuffs-may-overestimate-blood-pressure-in-individuals.pdf" target="_blank">large arms</a> leads to a blood pressure cuff overestimating BP, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2054405" target="_blank">some estimates</a> are that 30% of heavy people with high BP are misdiagnosed, so we're not even sure about the BMI correlation.</p>
<p>Some of the better data on sodium and BP is based on analysis of <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD009217/VASC_reduced-dietary-salt-for-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease" target="_blank">many published studies</a> which concluded that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing salt intake reduces BP a little bit not enough to help.</li>
<li>There there might be other benefits to heart health from reduced salt intake that aren't explained by BP reduction.</li>
<li>There is not enough evidence to support advising people to reduce their salt intake.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's another study I read, that I can't find right now, that measured sodium in the blood and urine, and BP at the cardiac artery. They found a small (&lt;3 mm Mg) reduction in BP, but only in 20% of people, and only when measured at the heart, not when measured at the arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The role of sodium in high blood pressure is NOT as well understood as presented.</p>
<p>Eating a lot of salt at once can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure (at least in some people, sometimes), which is not harmful if temporary.  Pathological hypertension is <em>a persistently elevated blood pressure</em>.  All the time.  It still varies, but the average is higher than what was deemed &quot;normal&quot;.  The body DOES effectively, quickly excrete excess salt consumed in most cases to maintain a targeted blood concentration.</p>
<p>But this doesn't prove that salt itself causes hypertension.  Some studies <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/" target="_blank">simply couldn't find any correlation between salt intake and hypertension</a>.  In fact they found those who ate a LOT of salt tended to have the healthiest blood pressure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/18311/chapter/1#x" target="_blank">https://www.nap.edu/read/18311/chapter/1#x</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/224097.php" target="_blank">People with the lowest salt in urine (which comes from reduced salt intake) had <em>higher</em> overall mortality</a></p>
<p>Basic problem here- people dismiss science that contradicts &quot;known facts&quot;, because they must be wrong, because we know the opposite to be true because someone established the truth in the 70's.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0115/p359.html" target="_blank">Low-salt diet reduced blood pressure readings, but did NOT reduce mortality in the end</a>.  This could mean hypertension is only an indicator of the problem, but not THE problem.  e.g. your car makes a ticking noise, but you can no longer hear the noise if you turn up the radio.  And also mechanics are advising everyone to keep their radios loud to prevent ticking noises.</p>
<p>What they DID find, and a solid theory goes like this (TLDR= it's mostly obesity):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>High blood pressure often accompanies high BMI, a well-established health risk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High salt intake often occurs in high BMI individuals, because a lot  of less healthy food likes to use a lot of salt.  But maybe the salt's not the problem here, the massive fat and carbs in it are.</p>
</li>
<li>Even if you got blood pressure down by reducing salt intake, it may do nothing to improve your health and longevity.  Lowering BMI would, though, even without a low-salt diet.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add to the confusion, I've heard a lot of anecdotal accounts at least that low-salt diets intended to reverse or prevent high blood pressure would sometimes <em>increase</em> blood pressure, or cause negative symptoms.  Not well studied, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One important way the body will regulate blood pressure is by the kidneys. They have receptors that will monitor when blood pressure increases, you will urinate the excess, and when it decreases your body will conserve. This is by the use of hormones, one important being aldosterone, which will use sodium as a way to conserve water. This is by the rule we had to learn, &quot;Water moves where Sodium moves,&quot; this is because sodium is a magnet to water. Now there is times this will not work-but for the kidneys it does work. So when the kidneys notice a decrease in blood pressure-sodium is released so that any water thats left within the tubules will circulate back within the blood stream. Hope I helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ingest too much salt, your body will excrete it. It will only hold onto as much as it needs to maintain normal BP and cellular function.</p>
<p>High BP is not a result of too much sodium, but by reducing sodium you can lower BP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
