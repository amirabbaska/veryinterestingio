Can't seem to find the link, but I recall she said North Korean is very strict and almost militaristic, and doesn't have much in the way of slang or contractions.</p>
<p>South Korean, by comparison, is loaded with slang and Western phrases and indirect ways of expressing yourself.</p>
<p>She said one of the things that marked her as North Korean when she first moved was her complete lack of slang and pop culture references, she spoke very rigid, structured, formal Korean that they found odd and old-fashioned in the South.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given the way language works, it's a very safe assumption that there are differences in the dialects of North and South Korean. How substantial those differences are, and what they are, are two entirely different and difficult to answer questions. </p>
<p>What we do know is that in North Korea, the standard for the language is based on the Pyongyang dialect. In South Korea, it's based on the Seoul dialect. These were different before the split of the two Koreas. We also know there are orthographic differences between the two languages, and that when they borrow words from other languages, they're borrowed differently in terms of phonology and loanword rules. North Korea has a tendency to borrow more heavily from Russian, and South Korea from elsewhere (English, Chinese, etc.) so the imported words can have large differences even when meaning the same thing when translated into the appropriate dialect.</p>
<p>Now to get to your second question. Language is <em>never</em>^* frozen in time. Language change is a process as alive as you or me. North Korean and South Korean have demonstrably diverged as languages -- they're still mutually intelligible, which is one of the features used to determine whether two dialects/languages are the same language or two separate ones. <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-19/korean-today-virtually-two-languages-and-thats-problem-north-korean-defectors" target="_blank">This article</a> from 2015 discusses it a fair amount. Hopefully this helps! I'll keep an eye on my inbox for followups. </p>

<p>^*: Language committees can freeze certain aspects of language without much of an issue. Check out Iceland's for an example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a question that has been asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4wqk64/are_we_aware_of_any_linguistic_differences/" target="_blank">before</a>, so check out that thread for some more info.</p>
<p>To quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a number of notable differences, apparently. While there seem to be very few minor phonetic changes, there are changes in vocabulary, the generation of neologisms, and syntax.</p>
<p>To quote wholesale from my reference:</p>
<p>Some differences are noted in the phonetic and phonological fields, and much more serious and wide-spread divergence is found to have occurred in semantic and stylistic areas as well as in the area of vocabulary. It is also noted that Pyongyang speech is intended to sound, and actually does sound, extremely provocative and militant to speakers of Seoul Standard, due, no doubt, to a combined effect of harsh words and expressions coupled with extreme stress and intonation.
A systematic, all-inclusive, and politically motivated language policy has been conceived and carried out unilaterally in North Korea ranging from the writing system, standard language, and language purification to dictionary compilation and spelling rules. As a result, the Seoul Standard language has hardly changed in many aspects, whereas the North Korean language has departed considerably from the traditional norm, that is, from Seoul Standard, thus speeding up the linguistic divergence between the two Koreas.
The underlying factors for the South-North linguistic divergence are found to lie in (i) the geographical as well as sociocultural separation of the two Koreas and (ii) the radical, politically motivated language policy adopted and pursued by the North. In particular, the official introduction of the Pyongyang dialect as the so-called standard 'Cultured Speech', in violation of the traditional Seoul Standard, is very significant in that it has accelerated language divergence by polarizing the standard language in Korea.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were always accent differences across the peninsula as there is anywhere, but yeah since the separation there's been a bit of diversion.</p>
<p>A lot of it is in the choice of vocabulary. You know how a while back there was a story about how the Quebecois language police tried to insist on calling hot dogs 'Chien chaud', because it was 'more French'? Imagine that, but effective rather than simply laughable.</p>
<p>In other words, while the South uses a lot of loan words and pop culture slang from English and other sources, the North 'keeps it Korean', but somehow manages to be weird while doing it. Take the words for 'panties' for example:</p>
<p>South Korea: 팬티 (pronounced 'panty')</p>
<p>North Korea: 으뜸부끄럼가리개 (translates to something like 'shield for your modesty')</p>
<p>It's reached the stage at this point where if a regular North Korean and South Korean were to meet, there'd be a bit of confusion before they got used to each other's way of speaking. Imagine you'd never heard a Scottish accent before, then went to Edinburgh. The majority of the language is the same, but it would take a couple of days to get used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Suwon, a bit south of Seoul and some South Koreans pointed out the linguistic differences for North Koreans. </p>
<p>Like Japan South Korea adopts many English words to mostly name modern stuff. I think they're called loan words (? Open to correction). I think North Koreans don't use loan words. One example is 'ice cream'. Which South Koreans use as a loan word but I believe (never heard!) North Koreans call it something else. Not sure exactly what because the South Koreans were laughing as they were telling me this, perhaps something like ice or snowball or similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
