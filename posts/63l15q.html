While trying to rebut some counter arguments, I came across <a href="https://emfscientist.org/images/docs/Script-Introduction_to_the_United_Nations_EMF_Appeal_Delivered_by_Martin_Blank.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf</a> from <a href="https://emfscientist.org/" target="_blank">these guys</a>. </p>
<p>Trying not to cringe at the sensationalism and the fear-mongering, i came across this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before Edison's lightbulb, there was very little electromagnetic radiation in our environment. The levels today are very many times higher than natural background levels and are growing rapidly because of all the new devices that emit this radiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this claim true? How do &quot;natural&quot; sources of radiation compare to our artificial ones, in intensity and danger to our health?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers haven't addressed your question as directly as they should. Your mobile phone in your pocket is actually much brighter than the sun in radio waves. And if aliens were to look at our solar system in radio, they would see Earth as millions of times brighter than the Sun.</p>
<p>However the other responders are correct that if you look at the energy output from the sun, it is much brighter at higher energies of light. And these are far more dangerous. Apart from specific microwaves that excite water (in a microwave), the radio end of the spectrum is very low-energy and harmless. So while our devices are comparatively very bright in radio, they carry a tiny amount of energy and negligible risk to humans. With ~billions of people exposed to radio waves every day, it would be completely obvious by now if we had a problem.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Are artificial radio waves intense compared to the sun? Yes, they can be.</p>
<p>Are they dangerous to humans? No. They have very little energy and don't interact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The power output of the Sun, as received on Earth can go up to 1 kW per square meter on a good day.</p>
<p>Compare that to a cell tower. I had some issues finding exact figures, but most of what I saw points in the direction of cell towers having an actual radiated power output of 10s of Watt at the most. Unless you're climbing into one, you're only getting a tiny fraction of that power.</p>
<p>There's a reason why we make panels specifically to collect sunlight and not other types of radiation. And there's a reason we spray ourselves with sunscreen, but there's no anti-WiFi spray. What the Sun bombards us with is vastly more intense than anything our puny devices can produce. Not to mention that sunlight, being mostly visible light and infrared, with a hint of UV, consists of photons with higher energy than the RF radiation produced by electronic transmitters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That is insane nonsense.  As /u/Rannasha said, the rule of thumb is that when the sun is shining it hits every square meter with about 1000 Joules of EM energy every second.  Conversely, an incandescent lightbulb gives off about 5 Joules per second and a radio tower gives off about the same.  A Wi-Fi router gives off about 0.1 Joules a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since it hasn't been mentioned yet: Blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>There is the constant black-body radiation coming from the Earth, your car, your house, and anything else at any reasonable temperature.  Everything above 0K (ie, *everything) emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation with a distribution of frequencies related to their temperature.</p>
<p>The blackbody radiation is exactly what a <em>thermal</em> camera is measuring.  It identifies the intensity of the infrared electromagnetic radiation to estimate the temperature of the emitting surface.</p>
<p>When you see hot metal around 600^o C start to glow?  That's just where the blackbody spectrum has reached significant visible frequencies of light.  Light bulbs work off the same principle.  Fire does too.  The dramatic heat you feel from putting your face near a campfire, many times the heat felt from the Sun, is just some visible (and mostly infrared) electromagnetic radiation hitting you and warming you up.  Incidentally, the Sun is mostly all blackbody radiation too.</p>
<p>And microwaves are lower energy than infrared waves. Though really all non-ionizing radiation should be weighted roughly equally when measuring total power and estimating damage.</p>
<p>The levels of background <em>microwave</em> radiation now from cellular are probably higher than background levels.  But only because everything is too hot to give up significant microwaves.  They're busy spitting out <em>more</em> energetic infrared energy.</p>
<p>Not that any of this logic will do any good 'debating' with people who first established their opinion by a route other than logic.  Might help with your audience though.  The Sun is brighter than any city at night. And standing in the sun makes you feel warmer than standing in the middle of 50 cell phones.  Considering how poor of penetration all non-ionizing radiation has through water, everything gets integrated together as heat on your skin.  If these people fear electromagetic radiation, they're going to have to find a way to turn the sun off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Increases in childhood leukemia are strongly linked to living in close proximity (&lt;200m) to high voltage transmission wires - highly suggestive of a link to high intensity EMF, but this doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean it's the EM fields are causing the damage. </p>
<p>There could easily be other environmental issues causing the link (herbicides used in right of way maintenance), but the amount of low frequency EM energy (enough to light fluorescent tubes) and ionization products is far higher than can be found in most other environments.</p>
<p>While high frequency EM radiation is more energetic than lower frequencies, we have also evolved to be resistant to EM fields commonly found in nature, even though they are relatively intense (sunlight). </p>
<p>There is some evidence to suggest that lower frequency EMF can interfere with the electrical and ectrochemical processes of living things under specific circumstances. </p>
<p>How much of these interference effects might be found in a specific environment is going to be so highly variable that only gross generalizations (I. E. possible link to childhood leukemia) are useful without site specific study.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
