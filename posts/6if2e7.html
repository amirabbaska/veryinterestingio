		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes a huge amount of mechanical pressure to kill bacteria. There is a food preservation process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascalization" target="_blank">Pascalization</a> that uses pressure to kill molds and spores. It is used as an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization" target="_blank">Pasteurization</a>, which uses heat. The pressures involved a pretty huge -- 50,000 PSI. That's giant hydraulic press kind pressure. </p>
<p>Pascalization is not as effective as Pasteurization. I've only ever seen it used for very acidic products, like grapefruit juice. Strong acidity excludes many of the most dangerous food-borne pathogens, and so pascalization is more to prevent spoilage than to protect humans. It does not render food completely sterile, but it does extend shelf life.</p>
<p>When you step on something as small as a bacterial cell, you are also stepping on the goop the bacteria is living in (microbiologists call it a &quot;matrix,&quot; but I think &quot;goop&quot; is more illustrative). There is pretty much always goop, or the bacteria wouldn't be able to survive. Some bacteria do swim some of the time, but most of the time, they rely on diffusion to move compounds around their immediate vicinity. If you shrank yourself down to this scale, water would be like damp concrete or hard packed earth that is being vibrated (not a perfect analogy, but close). You can push things through it, but it takes a lot of work. Swimming is very, very hard work, and you'd want to avoid it if you can. Water with other stuff in it -- i.e., goop -- would be even stiffer. The cells are buried in that. Even if the layer of goop is completely invisible, from a cell's point of view, it could still be like sitting at the bottom of a lake.</p>
<p>When you step on the goop, what will happen is the goop will squirt around the hard structures to which it is attached. This probably won't bother any cells that aren't already ruptured or breached. They have to be tough to move through the goop, and the kind of violent disturbance you would cause by stepping on the goop is probably not very different from other disturbances that the bacteria rely on for long-distance travel.</p>
<p>As your foot comes down on the floor, some of the goop will get trapped in small cavities, and in those places the local pressure could get quite high. Probably not 50,000 PSI, though, and so I doubt many cells would be physically harmed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf4YyXVoWeA" target="_blank">Unless you are the girl in the Paul Simon song, maybe.</a></p>
<p>What will happen, though, is that some bacteria will be separated from the nutrient environment they were growing in, and that probably will kill them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and No.  Bacteria are small enough that the surface of the bottom of your shoe (and the surface you are walking on) are full of relative valleys and troughs - very much large enough in which to be kept away from the crushing forces.  </p>
<p>That said, it's certainly true that some are killed - e.g. that bacteria sitting on the peak of a spot on your shoe hitting the peak of the concrete will get crushed.  But...the million brother bacteria right next to it are left fine.</p>
<p>TL;DR: don't use a fly swatter to wash your hands clean of bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're just walking around, no. On average, a bacterium is about 1/10,000th of a centimeter, which is smaller than the human eye can see (by about 1,000 times in magnitude). A surface may appear to be smooth to the naked eye, but that same surface under a 1,000x power microscope will have hundreds upon hundreds of grooves and dips that bacteria can chill in if you were to step on them. </p>
<p>Of course, bacteria <em>can</em> be crushed. They're soft little organic dudes. Maybe you could crush a really big colony of bacteria with a perfectly smooth surface against another perfectly smooth surface. But in every day life, you're not killing bacteria by walking around (you can't sanitize your floor by stomping around). It's more likely that you're just spreading them around. And since viruses are usually about half the size of bacteria or less, the same goes for them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the museum of Natural History in NYC, there is a display outside the relatively large planetarium allowing you to visualize the relative sizes of objects. The virus visualization makes the huge sphere of the planetarium as a single average human cell. A virus in comparison is the size of the period at the end of a sentence on the sign. I'd imagine a shoe could be the size of the state or perhaps larger. Seems that it would be rare to harm a virus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is battling an autoimmune disease and I bought her a spa package for a two hour massage. She loved it. Came back home and 30 minutes later was in the worst pain of her life, muscles and joint inflammation.</p>
<p>Talked to the doctor that is treating her a couple weeks later and he said that massages can release dead bacteria that is stored in the muscle tissue and kill some living  bacteria. Causing a herx (is it called herx?) reaction where the body is disposing of large quantities of dead bacteria through your Los stream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
