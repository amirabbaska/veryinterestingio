		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elementary particles are pointlike, as far as we can tell. But there are subatomic particles which are not elementary particles, for example atomic nuclei.</p>
<p>Nuclei come in various shapes and sizes. Of course they are quantum-mechanical objects so you have to be careful about how you define their &quot;shape&quot; and their &quot;size&quot;. But the details of doing that are not that important.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons inside a nucleus live in discrete orbitals, just like atomic electrons do. And just like there are &quot;special&quot; numbers where the electron shells fill up (noble gases), there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(physics\)" target="_blank">magic number</a> of nucleons which lead to enhanced nuclear stability.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you consider the structure of <em>doubly</em>-magic nuclei (both proton and neutron numbers are magic) like oxygen-16 and lead-208, they must be shaped like perfect spheres, and their sizes are small compared to other nuclei with similar mass numbers.</p>
<p>In the opposite extreme, you can have nuclei where the shell model orbitals are distorted or rearranged due to nuclear correlations far away from magic numbers. You can have cases where the outermost nucleons have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_nucleus" target="_blank">huge orbitals</a>.</p>
<p>A famous example of the first case is lead-208, and a famous example of the second case is lithium-11. These two nuclei, despite having hugely different mass numbers, have about the <strong>same size</strong>. It's because lead-208 is doubly-magic and lithium-11 is a halo nucleus.</p>
<p>Imagine nucleons as if they're inflated beach balls. How would you feel if I told you that I could arrange 11 beach balls and 208 beach balls such that they have the same size? It's very hard to picture this with classical objects like beach balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the particles are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles" target="_blank">identical particles</a> then they are indistinguishable even in principle.  This means that all of their features must be the same---they have the same charge, the same spin, the same mass, etc.  This <em>sounds</em> like somewhat of a trivial statement---of course if you can't tell them apart, they're indistinguishable!  The point is that <em>there are</em> indistinguishable particles.  That didn't have to be!  The world could have been made out of infinitely many fundamental ingredients, for example.  Or there could be many varieties of protons---protons that are striped (I don't mean literally visually striped), protons that are spotted, zig-zag protons, flannel protons, etc.  No.  We just see protons, and you can't &quot;tag&quot; a proton like you might tag a wild animal, so that when it goes out of sight and you encounter another one later you can be sure it's the same proton.  You cannot: protons are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>If you put a proton in a magnetic field, then its shape will distort.  But, <em>every proton distorts the same way</em>.  We believe fundamental particles like electrons and quarks to be point-like.  But if they ultimately have a finite size or are made of vibrating strings or whatever, each electron will be the same as every other electron, each up quark the same as every other up quark, each down quark the same as every other down quark, etc.</p>
<p>edit:  But it need not be the case that if we discover quarks have finite size that up quarks must have the same size as down quarks (for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends on how you define size. If you want to be analogous to the macroscopic world then yes, as others have answered, all particles appear point like, I.e. You can get as close to them as you like given enough energy. However, if you define size by how much energy it takes to approach, then size depends on the field created by the particle. For example, if you were probing a proton and a neutron with another proton, it would be a lot easier to get close to the neutron than the proton because of the equal charges of the proton. (This is a simplification because you obviously get particles that 'attract' each other I.e. With opposite charges and so you may be wondering if size is a quantity that depends on what you want to probe with) This leads to a definition of size that can be defined by the modulus of the field emitted by the particle. With this in mind, there are differences in sizes between different subatomic particles. An obvious example would be between the charge neutral neutron and a positively charged proton, but there are more exotic baryons with a quark composition such that they have a charge of 2 such as the double plus Delta (composed of 3 up quarks). This definition of size is not rigorous however; it is easier to consider particles as point like structures that emit properties.</p>
<p>You asked about some protons being larger than others, and while all protons are the same at ground level, when you give a particle more energy, it's wavefunction tends to get spread out. Think about how you were taught that atoms 'vibrate' more the more energy they were given (again this is a simplification, the real reason has to do with the uncertainty principle). This means that particularly energetic particles can be considered spatially 'larger' than lower energy equivalents, although this effect is very small for reasonable energies. </p>
<p>This being said, when you take combinations of particles, you can define a size much more easily. A good example of this comes when looking at the radius of an atom. If you go with a definition of radius based on a distance from the centre of the nucleus required to bring another atom such that both atoms interact, you can define an atomic radius based on the orbital distance of the furthest bound electron to the nucleus. If you remember your high school chemistry, orbiting electrons come in groups known as shells. A simplification of this leads to the conclusion that the larger the number of shells a particle has, the larger the radius of the furthest orbiting electron. However, this is a huge simplification as it does not take into account the fact that the larger the nuclear charge, the tighter electrons are 'pulled' towards the nucleus and so the smaller each electron shell radius is. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question, at least partially. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protons and neutrons are not &quot;larger&quot; than electrons because electrons are not particles. They don't have a size or mass. </p>
<p>We visualize them as being a particle because it allows us to make sense of the chemistry, but in reality all the electron really represents is a probability wave. It's an electric charge. It is used to describe the state of an atom, but it is not a physical thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful question because it really highlights the limits of science and what science really does. What science really does is come up with models of reality and then test them to see if they have predictive value. Electrons are defined as having zero volume. Clearly that doesn't make any sense. If something has zero volume, how can it have mass? How is it even a physical object? Great questions. But it doesn't matter in a sense, because the model works, and that's the goal. One can legitimately ask if there even are any electrons at all, objectively speaking, or whether there is anything in reality that corresponds to the particular idea of an electron you have in your head. </p>
<p>So are all these little particles the same? The truthful answer is nobody really knows. They're defined in the models as all being the same, because there's no need to define them differently. But are they really all the same? Are there even such discrete objects as electrons out there in nature, or are they just useful fictions in models? The reality may be much stranger than we imagine, despite the success of our models. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
