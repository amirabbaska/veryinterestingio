		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some users, like u/Jake0024, make the correct argument from thermodynamics that heat travels from hot to cold. What is unsatisfying about this argument is that it goes against our intuition about how lenses work. After all, can't we just focus an image of the moon down to an arbitrarily small size? And the smaller we make it, the more concentrated the light gets and the hotter it can heat something up. </p>
<p>The problem with this intuitive argument is that the simple lens equation we were taught in high school or college is a lie. Or rather, it is an approximation for small angles. For a lens that takes an object at position o and focuses it to an image at position i, the magnification is supposed to be M=i/o. So just get a shorter focal length and i will get arbitrarily small, right?</p>
<p>But this approximation for the magnification comes from the conservation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue" target="_blank">etendue</a>. Here is a simplified version of how it works: If the lens has a radius r, then we can define an angle theta_o=arcsin(r/o) and an angle theta_i=arcsin(r/i) on each side of the lens. The conservation of etendue tells us the magnification will be:</p>
<p>M=theta_o/theta_i</p>
<p>In the small angle approximation arcsin(x)=x, so this reduces to the formula we learned in school. But when you try to really focus the image down to a small spot, you won't be able to use the small angle approximation on the image side - the image sits very close to the lens now. And theta_i can't get any bigger than π/2. So we get:</p>
<p>M=2*theta_o/π</p>
<p>Since the moon is far from the lens, we can justify a small angle approximation there and write:</p>
<p>M=2*r/(π*o)</p>
<p>So the magnification is actually proportional to the diameter of the lens (2*r) in this limit of a highly focused beam. Aha, so we can still focus the moon down to an arbitrarily small spot! Unfortunately, the total light collected by the lens is proportional to its diameter squared. So a tightly focused image of the moon has the same intensity per square meter, whether it is created by a giant lens or a tiny one. It turns out this limit is equal to the intensity per square meter at the surface of the moon. Therefore, the moon can't heat things up any hotter than they would get sitting on the surface of the moon.</p>
<p><strong>tldr:</strong> If you move past the small angle approximation you learned in school, you find there is a limit to how small you make your image of the moon. This prevents you from using moonlight/sunlight/etc for reaching arbitrarily high temperatures with passive optics.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> A single mode laser behaves as if the light is coming from a point source, so you can focus laser light down to very small spots and heat things up to arbitrarily high temperatures. This doesn't violate thermodynamics either, because lasers effectively have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature" target="_blank">negative temperature</a> that can transfer heat to any positive temperature system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing that's confusing is moonlight is really reflected sunlight (albedo). The temperature of the moon itself is based on the material (regolith) absorbing sunlight and then emitting it to space. Temperature only matters in this case if you're trying to focus the moon's IR light which relates to temperature via wein's displacement law. However you're really focusing the reflected sunlight and the moon IR light (which is very small).</p>
<p>With that being said it is theoretically possible to focus light to get hotter than the reflected surface it comes from if most of the light is reflected. I think the moon only reflects about 10% of the light so it may still not be possible.</p>
<p>For a source of light, you cannot use a lens to make the focused point hotter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This link discusses the question in some length. Particularly Curious One's answer a ways down the page. He goes into the physics behind it, and offers a possible scenario for using the moonlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second law of thermodynamics applies to closed systems. The earth moon system is not a closed system because of the sun. </p>
<p>Let's think photons. The sun emits a certain number of photons. At the surface of the moon there is a certain number of photons per area. Let's say for argument that the moons surface is Lambertian. Let's say it absorbs 99% and reflects 1%. </p>
<p>The question is simply whether or not 1% of the photons incident on the moon, reflected by its assumed Lambertian surface and collected by a hypothetical giant achromatic lens, would carry sufficient energy to heat a material enough for it to burn. After accounting for reflection off of the material to be burnt. </p>
<p>Someone with more time can pull real numbers and calculate it. But this is not a closed system of two backbodies and the second law of thermodynamics cannot be applied in this way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
