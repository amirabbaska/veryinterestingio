		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A philosophy professor once told me this was an example of existential anxiety. You're not scared you'll fall; you're scared you know you can jump. We are free to do whatever we want, our existential freedom, and this is something we often run away from or avoid. It's also a sense of existential anxiety in that it simply reminds us we will die one day, another life fact that we often try to avoid thinking about. Another example he gave me on this subject was how sometimes when you're driving, you realize that all it'll take to cause a giant car wreck that might kill you and other people is just a little slight turn to the other lane - and into the oncoming car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of answers explaining how its called, but I didnt see a single answer explaining how to deal with it. </p>
<p>The short and simple answer is to not care. If you try to get rid of your intrusive thought the moment one comes up, and you are successful, your brain will reward itself by releasing dopamine.
So in order to get rewarded again, the brain will have to have an intrusive thought again before it can get rid of it so the brain can get it &quot;hit&quot; again.</p>
<p>So only observing the intrusive thought, acknowledging that it's there seems to be the solution for them, loads of people have intrusive thoughts, so you shouldn't really be bothered by them. </p>

<p>Then when I was 20, I went exploring a construction site. I rounded a corner, saw an open elevator shaft, and just jumped right in, zero thought involved. </p>
<p>I broke all the bones in my arm, a compound fracture through the shoulder, my hip always falls out of place now, and I got concussed.</p>
<p>I also ruined my phone and a pack of smokes because there was water at the bottom...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
