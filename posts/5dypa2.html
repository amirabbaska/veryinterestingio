<p>Edit: I had no idea that (1) there would be so much oil that we consider unrecoverable, and (2) that the true answer was so...unanswerable. Thank you, everyone, for your responses.

<p>Almost all of oil is still in the ground. The vast majority of the oil hasn't even been discovered and most of the oil isn't recoverable with current technology.</p>
<p>What we have used up are the accessible lowest hanging fruit. The readily available and accessible cheap oil. Like in east texas, saudi arabia or baku.</p>
<p>Just in terms of shale oil, there are nearly 5 trillion barrels of it. </p>
<p>&quot;A 2008 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale at 689 gigatons — equivalent to yield of 4.8 trillion barrels (760 billion cubic metres) of shale oil&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_shale_reserves" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_shale_reserves</a></p>
<p>But that's just discovered shale oil and most of it 3.7 trillion barrels are in the US. There are tons of other shale oil deposits all around the world that hasn't been discovered or hasn't been assessed. </p>
<p>Add to that the amount of oil in harsh environments like arctic or antarctica or deep sea regions like south china seas, humanity has only just tap a tiny portion of oil in the world. There is a reason why britain, australia, US, russia, etc haven't abandoned their claim on antarctica. There is shitload of oil there.</p>
<p>But most of the oil is prohibitively expensive or technological difficult to extract currently. We have used up significant amounts of &quot;easy&quot; oil. But that's a tiny fraction of overall oil on earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of oil isn't worth extracting.</p>
<p>Yes, it is estimable. What you would want to do is estimate the amount of oil in the ground in areas we know well and then extrapolate to basins that aren't explored well. More refinement will look at how much potential source rock is mature.</p>
<p>Now, most oil won't be economical to extract. It could be somewhere remote (arctic, Antarctic) or unexplored (maybe 1/3 of basins are well explored), in small quantities relative to the cost to extract (very common problem for oil companies, they call this a technical discovery), or of poor quality (heavy, full of sulphur-think tar sands). Next, even when you extract oil from a field, most usually remains in the ground--recovery factor of 25%, meaning we get 25% out is common, over 50% is rare.</p>
<p>Combining all of these, I would estimate the amount of total oil we've pulled out at around 1% to 5%. Definitely possible to get a better estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all of the oil is right where it has been for millions of years. The problem is that most of it isn't what you'll hear described as &quot;recoverable with current technology&quot;. This either means we can't detect where it is closely enough to drill, or it's too expensive to get out of the ground for some reason (too deep, to spread out).</p>
<p>The notion that oil will &quot;run out&quot; someday is a common misconception. That's simply not how resource depletion works. We won't all wake up one day and see on the news that the last drop of oil has been take out of the ground. </p>
<p>What will happen is that we will burn through the easier oil at a steady rate and the price of oil/gasoline will rise to account for the increased costs of getting at less accessible deposits. Simultaneously, alternative technologies will continue to improve themselves and become less expensive. More and more people will switch over, until we eventually reach the point where there is no demand for oil at the price it would take to make continued production economical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Without providing you with a 400 page report， anecdotally we have used less than 30% of oil currently recoverable. </p>
<p>Meaning we have somewhere betwee  60 and 90 years left if we discover no new deposits or dont improve recovering techniques. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
