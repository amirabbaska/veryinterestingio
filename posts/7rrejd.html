		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you define a shadow to be. Electron microscopes technically generate an image by collecting data on a microscopic object's &quot;shadow.&quot; Electron microscopes can expose the shadows of individual molecules. (You can Google images of this.)</p>
<p>If we limit ourselves to observing a shadow due to visible light, then the smallest object to make a shadow would have to be at least a micrometer in length (1/100 of the thickness of a human hair) to interfere with/scatter visible light. Even then, you would need to set up lenses in a specific way to project the shadow and make it visible to the naked eye. (This is called Schlieren photography, Veritasium has a video. This essentially shows the shadows of A LOT of molecules convecting.)</p>
<p>Edit: Since I have sparked a discussion, I should justify my ELI5 conclusion. Light is the layman term for the &quot;electromagnetic spectrum.&quot; The behavior of light, a physical (aka observable and measureable) phenomenon, can be described mathematically as a wave. The tl;dr on waves is that we can define them by their properties of &quot;wavelength&quot; (λ) and &quot;frequency&quot; (f). By multiplying these values, we obtain the speed of the wave (v=fλ). The motion of light was uniquely set by the initial conditions of our universe, to approximately 300000000 meters per second (186000 miles per second) - we call this speed &quot;c.&quot; Since c must remain constant, the relation c=fλ demands that as frequency of a light wave increases, the wavelength must decrease (and vice versa). Hence, light exists on a spectrum. From low frequency/high wavelength radio waves to high frequency/low wavelength Gamma rays, the spectrum offers a linear variety of &quot;light.&quot; With some engineering, radio becomes a light we listen to, microwave becomes a light we cook with, and ultraviolet light is used to tan Mr. 45. Nature's engineering of the human eye and visual cortex system enables unimpaired individuals to observe a tiny sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum, we call this visible light. You can see all of the colors of this portion of the spectrum when you look at the rainbow luster of a DVD. The wavelengths can be as high as ~700 nm (red) to as low as ~400 nm (violet). On scales of larger than one micrometer, a shadow is caused by an object impeding the distribution of light from a light source and can be classically demonstrated with geometry; when you stand on the sidewalk on a sunny day, your body casts a shadow in the direction the sun's visible light would have gone if you weren't standing there. However, when you get to smaller scales, the behavior of light becomes a unique type of wave: a quantum wave. The tl;dr with quantum light is that as light is on its way towards wherever it's headed, it can take detours (after all it has to avoid A LOT of air molecules; imagine trying to shoot a bullet through a forest without hitting any trees). Essentially, this means that whether or not light interacts with atomic-scale matter depends on a roll of a dice, and the fairness of those dice depends on the conditions in which the observation is made. With a macro-scale object, this becomes trivial as the chance of visible light interacting with the matter is very high, the light is absorbed, and the lack of light behind the object is observed as its shadow. To better understand a quantum shadow, let's consider a single slit experiment. If we shine light through a small, vertical, rectangular slit and look at the projection on a screen behind the slit we see a bar of light in the shape of the rectangle, becoming darker towards its edges. This is because light spreads outwards from its source, the slit acts as a new point-source of light, most of the light goes through the center (shortest path to the screen) and less arrives at the edges as the distribution of light becomes more spread out the further it has traveled.  If we now invert the experiment, and shine light at a piece of matter the same size as the slit, we can consider the quantum result of its shadow. Certainly any light that the matter impedes would not shine on the screen and a shadow would be formed. However, both the left and right side of the piece of matter will act as their own single slit experiment, and light will spread across the region of the shadow,  with a contribution from both sides. Now since this is happening simultaneously, we will actually have results more akin to a double slit experiment. To tl;dr that one for you, waves (classical and quantum) have a property called interference where they can add or subtract to each other. The light will add and subtract itself depending on the conditions of your experiment. What this means is that you will either see no shadow or multiple shadows depending on your materials and how you set up your experiment. As your piece of matter becomes smaller than infrared scale, the dice become very unfair and the most likely result of visible lights journey has it avoid the matter altogether, casting no shadow, as if the matter wasn't even there. This is the case with uv radiation from the sun causing skin cancer. On its way to our skin, sunlight in the ultraviolet range (smaller than 400nm) is mostly impeded by the dead outer layers of skin, but the universe finally rolls a d20 and some light manages to squeeze through; a critical strike is dealt to an unlucky atom in the DNA of an unlucky living skin cell, ionizing it and creating instructions to make too many babies. We use these small wavelengths of light to make shadows of smaller objects. One example is xray, small enough wavelength to fly past the empty spaces between atoms, giving us images of dense structures like bones but making tissue transparent. A comment below mentioned using uv now as well for imaging small objects. Electron microscopes work on the same concept, different only in that electrons have mass and it is the exchange of momentum that is measured. (Though still the exchange of momentum between electrons is an interaction of light).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum-mechanically, a shadow is destructive interference of the scattering amplitude at forward angles (behind the scattering site), although colloquially one would assume that you’re talking about visible light being blocked by macroscopic objects. But really whenever something is scattering off of something else of finite “size” in space, you can have a shadow behind it. The wavelength of the projectile should be around the same size or smaller than the characteristic length scale of the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The physics guys and gals probably answered this best but there is an interesting condition in the eye called asteroid hyalosis where calcium soaps accumulate in the vitreous (gel in the eye) and do cast tiny shadows called umbral cones but these shadows are so short that they don't reach the retina and therefore are not visually significant. Soooo is it really a shadow if we can't see it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This really depends on how you define a shadow... I assume you mean a complete obstruction of the light source behind the particle?  </p>
<p>a physical light source would have a finite size, so a complete obstruction depends on the distance of the light source, and the distance of the object from the surface of the shadow as well as the difference in size of the light source and the object. In case that the light source is larger than the object, and the distance from the shadow surface is far enough to not permit a complete obstruction of the light at any point on that surface, the shadow would not be devoid of light.</p>
<p>Assuming a (non physical) point light source source:</p>
<p>In that case, too, it depends on the distance of the shadow surface, since due to diffraction, at a far enough distance compared to the object size over the wavelength, there would be no full obstruction anymore - well, there would be areas where no light reaches, but it wouldn't look like a shadow, especially as directly behind the object would be the maximal light intensity.</p>
<p>This all applies to macroscopic objects. </p>
<p>Once the object is small enough so that QM must be taken into consideration (this depends on the absorption cross section at the particular frequency, as well as the rate of deexcitation), there would no longer be a full obstruction due to the random nature of QM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten great physics answers.</p>
<p>From a photography standpoint, the other part of the question is going to be &quot;How large is your light source, and at what point does the shadow become so soft that it's below the noise floor?</p>
<p>In photography we often use very large very soft light sources in order to control how a shadow looks and falls on the subject. With a big enough light source, even relatively big things (from a physics perspective) like hair won't cast a discernible shadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
