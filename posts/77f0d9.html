It's pretty in depth but still clear and comprehensible enough for your average Willy Loman or Joe Bloggs. Plus did I mention how awesome the animation style is? In 60FPS no less. I fucking love Kurzgesagt's videos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I may be misinformed but I believe it's because of the bacteria in your gut. They live and thrive off of what you eat. If you feed them processed sugars and other things of the sort some will begin to multiply and depend on those sugars, while others will thrive off the healthier foods you eat. Some aerobic some anaerobic. The difference being some can survive without oxygen (I'm foggy on this part) and the others depend on it. So in short, these bacteria in your gut cause you to crave these after you haven't had some for such a long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, you may just be hungry. </p>
<p>In nature, salt and carbs were both important parts of a diet, and hard to come by. Humans have been naturally drawn to those flavors forever. This worked out really nicely (devour sweets whenever possible) until the advent of cheap, refined sugar. </p>
<p>I don't think, though, that my desire for something salt and sweet is because I'm nutriontionally low on either salt or sugar. The opposite is probably true. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may be because you are under stress and experiencing emotional/stress eating.</p>
<p>From - <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/emotional-eating.htm" target="_blank">https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/emotional-eating.htm</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Stress – Ever notice how stress makes you hungry? It’s not just in your mind. When stress is chronic, your body produces as it so often is in our chaotic, fast-paced world, it leads to high levels of the stress hormone, cortisol. Cortisol triggers cravings for salty, sweet, and fried foods—foods that give you a burst of energy and pleasure. The more uncontrolled stress in your life, the more likely you are to turn to food for emotional relief.'</p>
