You'll notices that sleeping on your belly might cause congestion and thenoving to your back gets rid of it. Gravity rules all! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons.  First, a lot of congestion is caused by mucus.  Your nostrils don't stay separate for long: they merge into one big passage at the back of the nose called the &quot;nasopharynx&quot;. The nasopharynx opens right over your mouth and throat.  Gravity will make fluid run downward, so if you put the stuffy side up, any blocking fluid may run out of the way eventually.</p>
<p>Second, your body is about 60% water by weight. Because fluids including water and blood naturally follow gravity, any part of your body placed lower than another will have extra.  If your nose is low compared to the rest of you, or one part is lower than another, you might get some congestion because there is extra fluid in the blood vessels and tissue around the nose. This is more pronounced in the nose than elsewhere, too, because you have a lot of blood vessels in some parts of your nose.  (Your body works hard against gravity to keep fluid from pooling in places by pumping blood, but it isn't always perfectly successful).</p>
<p>Finally, your nose has something called a &quot;nasal cycle.&quot;  If you google a cross-section of the inside of your nose, you would see curled shelves of bone on the outer wall, called &quot;conchae&quot; or &quot;turbinates.&quot;  These shelves are covered in tissue that can fill with blood when activated by a nerve, just like the penis or clitoris.  This cycle moves from one nostril to the other every couple of hours, so if you stay on one side for long enough, eventually the top side will unblock.  Not because of gravity, but simply because it was time to switch.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that very small changes in the size of a tube, like your nose, can cause big changes in the ability for air (or water, or whatever) to pass through it. This is denser than necessary by ELI5, but Poiseuille's Law tells us that the radius of a tube increases or decreases flow by a power of four- that means small decreases in the space in your nose can have a huge effect on air flow.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your nose is blocked, it's more often than not nothing to do with a blockage in the nasal cavity, but rather a buildup of fluid in the sinuses that 'pinch off' the airflow. When you lie on the opposite side, gravity redistributes these fluids, and the other side becomes blocked instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't lay on my right side without my nose getting plugged up.  As soon as I lay on my back or better lay on my left side I can breath through my nose just fine.  It's irritating because laying on my right side feels comfortable since I always have to lay on my left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
