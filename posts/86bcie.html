		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a social interaction that is fairly common in a lot of mammalian animals. Great apes will groom one another by picking fleas and dirt out of their hair. This strengthens bonds within a group and reinforces their ‘family’ ties.</p>
<p>Dogs and cats lick their young to make sure they’re clean and healthy. </p>
<p>It seems to be ingrained within a lot of mammals to form bonds wherever we can - scratching, grabbing, holding etc... seems to be a fairly common trait shared by many species.</p>
<p>We are after all an animal, albeit a highly developed animal but at the same time highly social and rely on social interaction.</p>
<p>And also it could be seen as a way of playing, like when young animals roll around on another. Play is incredibly important for the development of young animals (and humans) even forming social bonds and developing habitual skills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grooming behaviors are widely used in social animal species for group cohesion purposes. If you enjoy spending time with people then you'll spend time with them. Laughter is also used in this manner but it is much more limited. Humans are AFAIK the only species to laugh naturally. The key feature of joking around is that it doesn't have to be a a one to one experience, whereas brushing someones hair is more focused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered why touching fur feels good.  I don't get the same pleasure from touching other textures like glass or wood or even the hair on my head but I get it from rubbing the fur on my cat.  It is like it is an inborn trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s enjoyable because on some lines  it is instinctively similar to how humans feel when they pat/play with their own children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think half of the reason we do this is because we really think that it pleases the animal.  We can't talk to them like we so ourselves to communicate.  We definitely feel better conveying that we are not a threat and making an animal accept us with scritches makes us feel better.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
