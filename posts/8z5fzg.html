		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue LEDs came along after red, yellow and green, but today white LEDs use a blue LED plus phosphors to make red and green. So production of blue LEDs is commonplace if not exactly &quot;easy&quot;. </p>
<p>Deep blue fireworks are difficult because the burning copper compounds don't emit only blue. They emit blackbody radiation as well because of their heat. That makes for a less saturated blue. The temperature is critical. Too hot means more washed out. Too cool means less blue to start with. A similar effect happens when things are heated to incandescence. At first you see deep red, then orange, yellow, and white. The red doesn't go away as other wavelengths are added. You don't see an overall green or blue hue even though both wavelengths are present in a white hot object.</p>
<p>Is blue paint or dye difficult to make? I know blue is less common in nature than red, yellow, or brown, but green is also uncommon in animals. Many bright green snakes and frogs are actually blue and yellow. The blue comes from interference, the yellow from pigment. When they die, they sometimes turn blue as the yellow pigment fades away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer but blue is the shortest wavelength and therefore the highest energy of the visible spectrum. And higher energy is harder all around to deal with. For example, 7,000 kelvin light bulbs emit a lot of blue spectrum and many people find them to be burning and fatiguing of their vision. Another example is radio engineering, where higher frequencies are orders of magnitude more difficult to design and have increasingly erratic behavior. So it is built in to the wavelength/frequency of the light wave and the amount of energy required to generate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all comes down to energy. </p>
<p>For emission, blue light has the highest energy, so to emit it you need to have two states that are pretty far apart in energy that are set up for electrons to transition efficiently between them. Generally, the wider the energy gap between two states, the higher the chance there are other states in between (due to defects, etc.) that electrons would more efficiently hop to (usually non-radiatively), thus quenching the emission.</p>
<p>For pigments, the problem is the opposite. To appear blue you need to absorb red and green. This requires have a very low-energy transition that red light can excite <em>without</em> having a higher-energy one that blue light can. This can be a challenge too, since many extended materials that absorb red and green light (like Si in solar cells) also absorb blue to some extent and just end up looking black. </p>
<p>Three of the main ways to achieve this are to use a transition metal ion with a d-d transition in the red (usually Cu or Co), to use a near-IR absorption that tails into the visible, or to use an extended molecular structure to narrow the gap between ground and excited states. The first approach is how most ancient blue pigments like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_blue" target="_blank">Cobalt Blue</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azurite" target="_blank">Azurite</a>. The second mechanism is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_blue" target="_blank">Prussian Blue</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarine" target="_blank">Ultramarine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum_blue" target="_blank">molybdenum blues</a> work - a very easy  (read: low-energy) &quot;intervalence charge transfer&quot; where an electron hops between to atoms of the same element in different oxidation states. The last is a more modern approach, where extended pi-conjugated molecules like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phthalocyanine_Blue_BN" target="_blank">copper phthalocyanine</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_dye" target="_blank">indigo</a> are used; many of these organic molecules tend to be less stable to oxygen and UV light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue light has the shortest wavelength of all visible light, so it also has the highest frequency, and its single photons have the highest energy.</p>
<p>To absorb (or emit) photons of any energy, a molecule or materials has to have two electronic quantum states with just that energy difference, with the lower state occupied and the higher state unoccupied. Photons of blue light have a fairly high energy compared to typical energy scales for low-lying electronic states.</p>
<p>To build LEDs, the emitted photon energy depends on the material you use to build the device. Blue light is impossible to achieve with &quot;traditional&quot; LED materials such as GaAs and GaP. A lot of materials science went into building high-quality GaN devices that can emit blue light.</p>
<p>Physics is the most appropriate category, but there is also a lot of chemistry and some engineering involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
