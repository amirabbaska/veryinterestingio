<blockquote>
<p>First of all, falling asleep is a very smooth transition. You don't go from an awake state to a deep sleeping state within seconds but rather go from awake over pre-sleep, light sleep, slow wave sleep to REM sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Memory formation depends heavily on changes</strong>. We are most likely to remember something new rather than something that doesn't really alter over time. Falling asleep is a rather slow change so there is limited need to remember it.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>pre-sleep goes hand in hand with decreased perceptual awareness</strong>. Another reason you don't notice the small changes. Therefore, with decreased awareness there is just less content to store. So what are you expected to remember if you don't really notice anything?</p>
<p>Third, with the decreased perceptual awareness <strong>we switch to an internal reflective state</strong> thinking of things rather than learning new things. So you start to think about your perfect lunch that day, how yummy it was and what you will have tomorrow. So there is just nothing new to remember. This is probably what the quote I cited tried to express.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect is that the information isn't that important and you're not receiving much information into the brain, so what is there to remember? What colour was the 3rd car you saw yesterday? You have no idea because your brain doesn't store information unless it thinks it's important. </p>
<p>It's also important to realise that 'sleep' and 'wakefulness' are really just two points on an entire spectrum of consciousness. It isn't like you instantly go from being awake to being asleep; your brain slowly begins to inhibit lots of different parts of itself and the body. Your muscles become more paralysed, incoming information is filtered out, and eventually many of your brain processes (including memory) are inhibited. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the physiological reason, but I do know it may serve a purpose. Because feeling asleep is the most terrifying experience you can ever feel in your life. Let me explain:</p>
<p>You can train yourself to remain conscious during the transition from awake to asleep. When you fall asleep, your brain send signals to the body to paralyze it, to prevent involuntary movements that could injure you during your sleep. That sleep paralysis can be experienced consciously with some training (I experienced it when I was working as a casino dealer and my sleep patterns were fucked, resulting in being sleep deprived most of the time). </p>
<p>The problem is that if you remain conscious, your brain will instinctively try to rationalize that paralysis, to find a plausible explanation to why you're paralyzed. At that point you will experience what is known as night terrors / waking nightmares / hypnagogia. It's basically a nightmare that you can feel like is reality, and sometimes (for many people, me included) involves a shadowy evil figure crushing you and preventing you to breathe. What is very specific to hypnagogia is the intense feeling of fear you can experience. It's hard to describe and understand without having experienced it, but basically it's like you feel pure terror. Imagine watching a horror movie and being scared. Imagine that movie fear is only 10% of your potential fear. Now imagine 100% of the feeling of terror is unleash at once for you to experience. That's night terrors. It is THE MOST terrifying experience I've ever had in my life. Strangely, I also find it very interesting to experience, even though it's terrifying, it kinda makes me feel alive (I don't feel much things most of the time).</p>
<p>Anyway, not sure it answers your question, but you might find that fact interesting.</p>
<p>PS: you can google night terrors and hypnagogia to know more about that phenomenon, and how to induce it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are four stages of sleep</p>
<p>NREM( non-REM) 1 --&gt;2--&gt;3---&gt;2--&gt;REM</p>
<p>NREM 1 - theta waves, this is the point where you start drifting off into light sleep and or experience hallucinations and that &quot;falling feeling&quot;</p>
<p>NREM 2 - still theta waves and its a bit harder for you to wake up now- this is where you experience sleep spindles and K complexes ( this is where you are able to consolidate your memory and it protects your sleep by making it harder to wake you.</p>
<p>NREM 3- this is where delta waves kick in and its even harder to wake you from here</p>
<p>REM sleep- this is the stage where dreams occur and where sleep paralysis/ night terrors etc.. Your frontal cortex is important for processing information and making logical decisions, when in REM sleep it is dampened or attenuated thats why when you start dreaming of jiggly puff eating a peanut butter jelly sandwich near a volcano, it does not seem strange to you during that dream. Keep in mind this is where our physiological state is experiencing something called beta waves which is the same frequency of waves of when we are awake.</p>
<p>Also note these sleep &quot;cycles&quot; do not just occur once but multiple times and usually takes about 90 minutes for a full cycle to complete. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest reasons I'd that the transition from short term memory to long term memory takes time. About 30 minutes, actually. Short term memory is basically a bunch of neurons firing in a circle constantly refreshing themselves. Do it for about 30 minutes and it gets encoded into long term memory. </p>
<p>This process is really very sensitive and if it gets interrupted the memories are lost. This is why a lot of people who are in automobile accidents where they were knocked unconscious often say they don't remember the accident. It didn't have enough time to store the memory before things were interrupted.</p>
<p>As was mentioned by others, falling asleep is not an on and off process. You bounce in and out of sleep over and over again until you get to the big one. You are interrupting the memory storage process as you do it and losing your most recent memories.</p>
<p>This is also part of the reason why people can wake up in th night, talk, go get a glass of water, and go back to sleep and never remember any of it. If they are awake less than half an hour they probably won't remember it. Technically there are some other reasons like state dependence memory, but that's sort of a tangent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
