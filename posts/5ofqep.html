		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here are too simplistic and generalized which is fine for an eli5 but most  are somewhat inaccurate. </p>
<p>It's hard to say what specific component of the soup makes us feel better. But there was a study released in 2000 that looked into potential mechanisms of how chicken noodle soup makes you feel better. </p>
<p>Summary: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/10/001018075252.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/10/001018075252.htm</a></p>
<p>Paper: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035691" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035691</a></p>
<p>So generally, the symptoms you feel when you catch a cold aren't directly the result of the bug that caused the infection, but rather, a result of your immune system targeting the affected areas (ex. Throat, nose, lungs etc). </p>
<p>For example, you know how your nose gets all runny and you cough up phlegm? That's a result of your immune system reacting to the threat (typically a virus) and does so by kicking mucous production into overdrive. This traps the bug and makes it harder for it to get to its target tissue. A sore throat? That's a result of all the killed throat cells releasing chemicals (called cytokines) that make your throat swollen and tender.  </p>
<p>These cytokines are super important in directing an immune system response to the infected tissue. It directs the immune cells that are circulating in your blood stream to the site of infection. It also helps to fight the infection, and as a result makes you feel shitty (one such cytokine, TNF-alpha, is why your body aches when you have the flu. </p>
<p>What the researchers I mentioned found was that certain components of chicken noodle soup inhibit the ability of a specific type of immune cell (neutrophils) to find its way to the site of infection. Neutrophils will kill infected cells, and also make the area a hostile environment (by releasing cytokines) which all ends up making you feel shitty. </p>
<p>By stopping the neutrophils from migrating to the area of infection, it  makes you temporarily feel less shitty. </p>
<p>This is all shown In the lab, so it needs further studies to show a real effect in live humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heat helps to get the mucous flowing and you can clear out your pipes, giving you a temporary relief. </p>
<p>If you've got a stomach ailment it's mostly liquid so it's easier on the stomach too, but you're still getting nutrients and food so you feel better after starving for awhile. </p>
<p>It's a good food overall, but has added benefits </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can chime in a bit here, I recently saw a TV program that talked about it called food fact or fiction. They said the chicken in the soup releases fats that help you feel good and, since the root vegetables are cooked down, they are easier to eat. Which all helps in restoring nutrients and the steam helps loosen mucus, like others have said. Also liquids need to be restored which is easier to do if it taste good instead of plain water. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salt in the soup and its warmth can soothe a sore throat. A 2000 study claimed to have shown that it also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can relieve congestion too, although this is still uncertain. Eating chicken soup when you have a cold helps because you're breathing steam, which loosens up congestion. In some cases, store bought chicken soup was actually more effective in &quot;curing you&quot; than homemade chicken soup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to die from dehydration. </p>
<p>WHO did an extensive study about how to re-hydrate children orally because you just can't start an IV on every sick kid in Africa. </p>
<p>It turns out that pure water is HARDER to absorb than water with some salt and carbohydrate in it. So, the <a href="http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/fch_cah_06_1/en/" target="_blank">ideal re-hydration solution</a> is water with a little salt and sugar added. Add a small amount of protein and fat for calories and you basically have a recipe for chicken soup. </p>
<p>I find it easy to believe that the &quot;old wives&quot; figured this out by trial and error :( long before WHO did their science.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
