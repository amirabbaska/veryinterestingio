<p>Example: A few years ago, my old public high school was awarded a $10,000 grant for general improvements. Rather than utilizing that money to repair sidewalks, renovate the 40-year-old bathrooms, or upgrading our library computers, they renovated the football field/track, even though our football team was second-to-last in the league.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easy, the sports culture in the US grew up alongside the schools.  Have you noticed that sports around the world are centered around &quot;athletic clubs&quot; and such?  Well in the U.S., most began as high school and college sports and with no pro sports (apart from like golf, baseball and a few others) even the best athletes would quit after graduation.   The idea of serious athletes became culturally relegated to school age men and women until the 20th century, so naturally, the fierce regional rivalries that sports usually breeds, emerged in the high schools and universities in America, not clubs.  </p>
<p>Even when pro sports came of age, they paled in comparison to college atmosphere and energy for decades.   </p>
<p>The 20th century saw the Olympics and other international competitions take hold.  While other countries developed through sports clubs and creating &quot;Ministries of Sport,&quot; the United States had no need since, their schools were doing all the work already, and they were an instant heavy hitter on the international scene, dominating in a lot of sports.    </p>
<p>To this day, the US has never seen a need to develop the nations athletes any other way than using the High Schools as the prospect developer and the colleges are training centers.   This is hurting a few US sports, like soccer, where academies are only just now finally being built that train players much better than the NCAA.   A lot of Men's sports are suffering because schools are legally obligated to have an equal amount of male and female athletes.  Plus, the governing NCAA puts strict training hour restrictions on the athletes.  Which makes sense so a coach doesn't overwork an engineering major, but is bonkers for a US male gymnast who is going to the Olympics against a Chinese athlete who trains 10 hours a day. </p>
<p>EDIT:  I posted this in a comment but it's very topical here.   Stephen Fry described college sports as basically the most American thing to exist.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, other countries don't.</p>
<p>In other countries, sports are generally run on the 'pyramid system', which means that a team can advance into the league above by winning the league below.  Theoretically, any amateur team right at the bottom, even as a 'hobby team' has the potential to go right to the top.  As every community will have a team at some level, the local support tends to attach itself to this team (or the nearest professional team, or both) rather than to the local high school.</p>
<p>In terms of advancing to the professional leagues, individual players will often be signed up to the youth system of a professional club, so unlike the US, success at sport in the education system does not provide a direct pathway into the professional game, hence it has less consequences, even if the players involved are just as committed as in the US.</p>
<p>In the UK at least, university sports are taken more seriously than high school sports, and playing/training facilities are often very good, although large scale stadia as in US college football are unheard of as are the sums of money invested - again, this is because university sport does not generally form part of the pathway into professional sport.  </p>
<p>Certain events between rival universities may attract large crowds, but often that's related to the tradition of the event, rather than the importance of the event as a sporting competition, although the events may still be keenly contested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in the UK it tends to be clubs outside of schools rather than the schools themselves. Schools have sports teams but usually limited to the popular ones, mostly football, cricket, rugby, netball and athletics. Fee paying schools will typically have different sports they have teams for in addition to the above.   </p>
<p>Anything who shows talent will often sign up to the youth team for established sports so if that happened in the US you would have the LA Lakers under 11 team for example, and it is at that level that the real competition exists. As there is no draft system it also suits the clubs as they can uncover and develop a potential Â£100m player without having to buy them from another club.  </p>
<p>I do like the school sport culture in the US though. Until you hit the big time the only people in the crowd will be parents of the players. Must be nice to run out in front of hundreds or even thousands of kids supporting you at that age. I used to be a mid-talent runner and was lucky enough to be cheered on by about 150 people once and that was amazing. I never won anything though but just having people cheer your name shaved half a second off each lap. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High School Baseball is still a thing in Japan and ridiculously popular. The annual high school tournament is broadcast live on TV and becomes a source of national pride from whatever prefecture they come from. Its called <strong>Koshien</strong> and the entire thing sweeps up the country like crazy. When I was in Okinawa, everyone was glued to the TV to watch a bunch of 18 year old kids slug it out on account of the fact the local team from that area got to the final.  </p>
<p>Football (soccer) less so, but they do broadcast the high school cup final live on TV as well. </p>
<p>Baseball in Japan is kinda fucked up though. The professional league loses a shit ton of money because they still run it like its the 1960's and don't understand the modern-age with slick marketing and whatnot. A big problem you have is that many of the kids at the high-school level get really bad coaches and they are often worked to death. Especially at Koushien. Matsuzaka Daisuke who latter played in MLB, once pitched 17 innings, as a high-school kid. Crazy. </p>
<p>The whole concept of sport-science, technical coaching, fitness etc is very low. And its all blood and thunder nonsense. This is why soccer is continuing to dominate because they take a 21st century approach and get in qualified coaches teaching kids and get them thinking like athletes at a young age. You don't get that in baseball. Its all tradition and bullshit.</p>
<p>In terms of facilities and spending, I really can't comment that much. But often I find that Japanese schools pay for a lot of shit for their kids. And they'll equally build an arts centre and baseball field as much as they do tennis courts and libraries. Its equal opportunity  spending all across the board if you go to a school which excels at pumping out gifted kids in whatever field.</p>
<p>I will say this though, they train like a motherfucker. 5-6 days a week. Very common for sports teams in Japan, even to the university level. Even if the team is shit, they'll still train. Its the whole 'ganbaru' - never give up bullshit which consumes the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, sports are seen as a (potential) revenue stream for the school if they can get people attending games, paying for tickets or concessions, bringing in grant money from organizations that do scouting, etc.</p>
<p>Often, the sports programs get more attention because the administration believes that money put in to the sports teams is money that they will see returned and able to be reinvested in other areas.</p>
<p>It's not always(or even often) a net benefit to the school to put that money in to sports, but it's something that has to be examined on a case by case basis for each school- if the school budgets in your area are a matter of public record, it might be interesting to compare sports spending to revenue from sports related sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
