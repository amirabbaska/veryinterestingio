		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are referring to Cyclamate in causing cancer. That is [banned] (<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://www.cyclamate.org/pdf/cyclamate_6-19-13.docx" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://www.cyclamate.org/pdf/cyclamate_6-19-13.docx</a>) in the United States, though not in the European Union or Russia. Keep in mind though, it only provided weak evidence of carcinogenic activity during a treatment that involved the rats ingesting the human equivalent of 550 cans of diet soda per day.</p>
<p>I tend to be on the side of saying artificial sweeteners are fine. Aspartame is derived from aspartic acid and phenyalanine. Those are two amino acids you consume in far higher quantities in just about every product you eat (This is why it has a bitter after taste. It is designed to &quot;fall apart&quot; back into these amino acids after being consumed.)</p>
<p>As for the other most commonly used artificial sweetener, Sucralose, it has been extensively studied and science says it's [quite safe] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19464334" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19464334</a>). Even if there are some minor effects we haven't quantified yet, keep in mind Sucralose is 600x as sweet as table sugar, which [does] (<a href="http://time.com/4087775/sugar-is-definitely-toxic-a-new-study-says/" target="_blank">http://time.com/4087775/sugar-is-definitely-toxic-a-new-study-says/</a>) have a scientific basis for toxicity. Which means you'd be consuming 600x as much sugar as sucralose.</p>
<hr />
<p>TLDR; Artificial Sweeteners are perfectly safe to consume, and are in fact &quot;healthier&quot; than their natural alternative and should be featured in many people's diets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as stated in some previous comments, artificial sweeteners don't react much with the cells in our body and thus don't pose much direct health risk to humans.</p>
<p>If you want the MOST RECENT findings though, research into the human gut microbiome (all the bacteria living in your digestive tract) has highlighted some new concerns with many artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>One point of interest is that, although we are incapable of metabolizing many artificial sweeteners because we lack the enzymes to do so, many of the bacteria in our gut are in fact able to metabolize some of these products. Normal sugars like glucose or fructose are usually absorbed pretty early in the digestive tract but since we cannot metabolize these artificial sweeteners, a large amount of the dose makes it to the end of our intestines such as the ileum and large intestine where larger populations of bacteria live. </p>
<p>Typically these bacterial populations consist of dozens of different bacterial species living in harmony, but if one species is suddenly able to use a fuel source that is suddenly abundant (ie. sorbitol, aspartame, etc.) that the other species cannot, you will quickly get a population explosion. Acutely, this can cause problems such as diarrhea as the digestive tract flushes itself out. Chronically, it is believed that this imbalance in the microbioime, if persistent, could lead to conditions such as metabolic syndrome or trigger other inflammatory diseases in the body. Research in these effects are still ongoing but here is a quick review that will catch you up:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4615743/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4615743/</a></p>
<p>One of my favorite findings is that mice exposed to many artificial sweeteners did develop some early signs of metabolic syndrome (insulin insensitivity). And when they took the gut bacteria from these mice and transplanted them into the digestive tract of naive mice via fecal transplant, the naive mice developed almost the exact same symptoms despite never being exposed to artificial sweeteners!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
