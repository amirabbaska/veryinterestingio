		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instead of thinking of the act of dividing, let's think about what things are like after you divide.  So if you divide 15 by 3 you end up with 5. Why did you end up with 5? Because 5 groups of 3 makes 15. If you divide 8 by 4 you get 2 because 2 groups of 4 makes 8. </p>
<p>So what if we divide 10 by 0? You're thinking we should get 0. Do 0 groups of 0 make 10? Hmm...Weird... Is 8 divided by 0 also 0? So 0 groups of 0 also make 8? I thought 0 groups of 0 was 10? </p>
<p>Essentially, division is the opposite of multiply. So think of division as asking about multiplication:</p>
<p>8/4=2 because 2*4=8</p>
<p>15/3=5 because 5*3=15</p>
<p>10/0=0 because 0*0=10? No that's not right...</p>
<p>10/0 asks the question &quot;what times zero equals ten?&quot; Which is just a question that has no answer.</p>
<p>But here's where things get interesting, what is 0 divided by 0?  You might think it's 0... Let's check:</p>
<p>If 0/0=0 then 0*0=0?  Yes! That works!</p>
<p>But I might say that if you divide something by itself you always get the number 1. Let's check that:</p>
<p>If 0/0=1 then 1*0=0? Yes! That's also right...</p>
<p>If 0/0=7 then 7*0=0? Yes</p>
<p>If 0/0=54 then 54*0=0? Yes</p>
<p>It certainly seems like every number is going to work...</p>
<p>So when you divide 0/0 you are asking a question where the answer is &quot;all numbers&quot;. This causes problems when we work with calculations so we prefer to say that there's no answer to that question.</p>
<p>Other times, when you divide 7/0 you're asking a question that simply has no answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay so say you have 10 apples.  You can put those apples into 10, 5, 2, or 1 group/s quite easily.  You could even put them into 4 groups by splitting 2 of the apples in half.  How many apples would be in those 0 groups?  How do you put 10 apples into 0 groups?  </p>
<p>The answer is that you cannot physically put those 10 apples into evenly into 0 groups.  So the answer is undefined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real numbers with + and <em> form what is called a field. A field is basically just a set of stuff which obeys the same properties ordinary real numbers do (like distribution of </em> over + for example like FOIL). It is the generalization of the reals. </p>
<p>A field must have at least two distinct objects: an additive identity (so an element, let's call it 0, such that a + 0 = a for all elements a in the field) and a multiplicative identity (a number,  let's call it 1, such that a*1 = a for all elements a in the field). </p>
<p>The inverse of a number x is a number y such that x*y = y*x = 1.</p>
<p>To divide by something means you are multiplying by its inverse. So for example, we can divide by 3 because there is nothing wrong with multiplying by 1/3. And, of course, 3*(1/3) = 1.</p>
<p>What happens if we allow 0 to have an inverse? Call its inverse b. So, if b is the inverse of 0, then this means that 0*b = 1. </p>
<p>Why is this an issue? Well, because 0*anything = 0. Why is this true? </p>
<p>Since 0 + 0 = 0, it is true that r*(0+0) = r*0 for any number r. </p>
<p>Distribute r over the bracket like we're allowed to and you get r*0 + r*0 = r*0.</p>
<p>Now, just subtract r*0 from both sides and you see that r*0 = 0 for any number r. </p>
<p>So if you allow 0 to have an inverse called b, then you have two conflicting statements: 0*b = 1 but also 0*b = 0. So we can't do that. This contradicts both of the rules we laid out, and it also &quot;proves&quot; that 0 = 1, which is contrary to our assumption that a field must contain at least two distinct elements 1 and 0. We would have a bunch of nonsense statements in math, like 0 = 3*0 = 2*0 = 0, dividing by 0, we'd have 3 = 2. </p>
<p>So we don't allow division by 0 in a field like the real numbers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because division is the opposite of multiplication. Why is it that 6 ÷ 3 = 2? Because 2 × 3 = 6 , of course. Now let's try to divide by zero. What is  6 ÷ 0? Well, the answer would have to be a number that, when you multiply by 0, would give you 6.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your example, the answer is not actually 0. This is most easily shown through a quick exercise.</p>
<p>Let's start with the number 1 and we'll divide it by smaller and smaller numbers to see what happens as we get closer to 0.</p>
<pre><code>1 / 1 = 1
1 / 0.5 = 2
1 / 0.25 = 4
1 / 0.1 = 10
1 / 0.0001 = 10,000</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, we can see that as we divide by smaller and smaller numbers, the result gets bigger and bigger. By this pattern, we can presume that dividing by 0 will give us a result of infinity (∞).</p>
<p>However, we can approach zero from the other side as well: from the negative side. Let's start at -1 and divide by smaller and smaller numbers and see what happens.</p>
<pre><code>-1 / 1 = -1
-1 / 0.5 = -2
-1 / 0.25 = -4
-1 / 0.1 = -10
-1 / 0.0001 = -10,000</code></pre>
<p>Uh oh. This pattern makes it look as though dividing a number by 0 will give a result of negative infinity (-∞). How can something equal both <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y%3D1%2Fx" target="_blank">infinity <em>and</em> negative infinity</a>? Easy: It can't. This is why we call anything divided by zero as being &quot;undefined.&quot; It has no meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
