Isn't the antenna on it just passively receiving available cell signal?  Could you make a stereo use more power by having it &quot;try&quot; to find a better signal on a radio station?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A mobile phone generally does a couple of things when it is just kinda lounging around:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It has to tell the world where it is - this is so that the tower can route incoming calls to the phone.  This is done with an amount of power based on its current &quot;status&quot; of connection.  So...power consumption here is <em>variable</em>, based on signal strength.</p>
</li>
<li>When it doesn't have a connection, it will attempt to do so.  This &quot;find a connection&quot; signal is sent out at <em>full power</em>.  It does this after anytime it's lost its connection to a cell. </li>
</ol>
<p>So...no, it's not just listening passively - it's initiating and maintaining conversations with cells, so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most digital traffic relies on a handshake to create a connection. This hand shake has multiple parts but let's simplify it. </p>
<p>Tower: I am a tower at 900mhz for Verizon</p>
<p>Cell: I see you tower at 900mhz, I am cell123</p>
<p>Tower: I see you cell123 at 900mhz, can you use Band7</p>
<p>Cell: I can use Band7</p>
<p>Tower: Cell123 Use Band7</p>
<p>Cell: Using Band 7 now</p>
<p>Tower: Cell123 send your phone data.</p>
<p>Cell123: (Chunk of data)</p>
<p>Tower: (checks with network) okay cell123 you are connected, here is your call routing information, data rate, and IP addresses.</p>
<p>Cell: I am connected</p>
<p>When you are searching for a signal your phone is picking up a lot of towers usually that are to far away to do a good handshake. It might get some data but most is too weak to make it. Once connected the phone has an existing relationship with the tower and only transmits as needed. When there is no connection it has to transmit constantly to build a connection. There is a lot more to Cellular connections but that is my basic understanding of it.</p>
<p>Think of it a bit like the energy used to find an unknown person in a crowd versus just keeping an eye on a person in a crowd you already know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note -  difference between 2G and 3G phones - when a 2G phone turns on and starts looking for a network, it broadcasts at full power, and the network tells it to dial back power to the lowest necessary. 3G phones “start quiet” and ramp up their power output to appropriate levels, to preserve battery.</p>
<p>But like other have said, your handset is always trying to handshake with its network, and if it’s moving, it’s constantly reporting the signal strength it has to surrounding cells, so the network can do useful things like hand your call off between cells as you head down the road. Mobile, and especially the air interface, is outright voodoo black magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Battery life, as everyone knows, is extremely important for cell phones, so manufacturers do everything they can to reduce the power consumption.</p>
<p>The phone has to 'listen' to the radio to see if a call or text message is coming in.</p>
<p>When the phone handset has 'found' a tower, it's synced to a specific frequency and receives a very precise time signal from the tower. The tower (and network) tell the phone there's nothing for it. So, go to sleep for 1/2 second and then wake up and listen for 1/10 second. If there's anything for that phone it will only be sent during that 1/10 second. So the phone can turn its radio off and sleep 8/10 of the time and still receive a call or text within a second.</p>
<p>If the phone hasn't 'heard' a tower and isn't synced to a time slot, it has to listen all the time. And it's constantly shifting between multiple frequency bands. So it is 'awake' all the time and can't sleep. Because it can't sleep, it uses the battery all the time, and runs down much faster.</p>

It keeps on hitting tennis balls into the sunset, until something over the horizon sends the tennis ball back and the ball hits your phone in the face.</p>
<p>When your phone gets hit back in the face with the tennis ball, it knows that it has a &quot;signal&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
