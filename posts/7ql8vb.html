		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual ELI5: You know how when you're really frustrated you want to scream out and let out some energy? Well, what a light does is make a material (either a gas, like air, or a solid, like the thing inside old light bulbs) really really frustrated, and the light &quot;screams&quot; by emitting light instead of sound and therefore gives away a bit of it's energy. </p>
<p>ELI'm older. Lights work by &quot;exciting&quot; a material, whether that be the noble gas inside a fluorescent lamp or a tungsten wire inside an incandescent bulb. When a material is excited, the electrons inside the material move to a higher energy &quot;orbit&quot;. However, the electrons don't WANT to be in that orbit, they want to be in their home orbit. (Because they are most &quot;stable&quot; there, and the universe, in general, tends toward stability.) So when they get the chance, they move back down to their home orbit, but do to so they need to give off some energy. (Because an electron can't arbitrarily move from one level to another, something needs to happen to push it there or something needs to happen to allow it to fall down to a lower level.) That energy is emitted as a photon (light). So what the light has done is convert electricity into photons by a series of chemical/physical processes. </p>
<p>The photons are NOT always there. They're created in the instant the electron moves down to the lower energy level. Remember, photons are massless, they're just a form of energy, and converting from one energy type to another is easy. </p>
<p>EDIT: Oh and yes, photons will &quot;cease to exist&quot; if they are absorbed by something else. Essentially in exactly the opposite process. The photon hits the atom at a specific place and makes an electron &quot;excited.&quot; Therefore the photon (which was just energy) has now become the &quot;energy&quot; that is &quot;exciting&quot; the electrons. </p>
<p>It's like saying &quot;well if I splash water at a wall the water droplets don't exist after they hit the wall.&quot; That's... partially true, but the water DID something to the wall, it made it wet. Same thing with a photon. It DOES something to the atom. So while it doesn't exist AS A PHOTON anymore, it's still there, just in a different form, just like the water on the wall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are generated by the light source. How this happens depends on what type of light it is. Incandescent lamps heat up a piece of metal. Hot things emit light (called blackbody radiation). Flourescent lamps run electric current through a gas. The electricity excites the electrons in the gas atoms, which then emit light. LED lamps use a diode. A diode has two chunks of semiconductors stuck together. When electrons move from one chunk to the other, light is released where the joint between them is. The general idea is you're taking some form of energy, like electricity, and turning it into light energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they cease to exist if they hit something and aren’t reflected?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. If they hit something like a piece of black construction paper, they will be absorbed and turned into heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, you have to appreciate our model of physics is based on field theory. A field is something that has a value at every point in space. There are fields for all the fundamental particles. When the field gets excited enough, when the value at that point becomes big enough, it manifests itself as a particle in space. If we use a blanket as an analogy, there are always ruffles in the blanket, which alludes to theories about energy in a vacuum. Excite the blanket enough, and you'll get a bump like a tennis ball is underneath it. That's your quark, or whatever. These fields overlap, and some interact with each other. So if you get a field with a value large enough, that bump, that energy, is going to spill over into an adjacent field it interacts with, causing <em>it</em> to bump. So if you have a particle, like a neutron, made of several subatomic particles, it's because several overlapping fields all have bumps clustered around some point of origin.</p>
<p>Enter the electron. It orbits a nucleus. When energy is imparted into the atom, the electrons express this gain in energy by incrementing into the next higher orbital state. This is, to mine and our collective best understanding, discreet. It's either in this state or the next, I don't think it physically transitions across that space. I'm a little sketchy in that understanding.</p>
<p>When that energy dissipates, the electron falls into a lower orbital. That energy has to go somewhere, and for some reason beyond me, it comes out of that transition as an excitation in a field the electron interacts with, it comes out as a photon. Photons don't interact with the higgs field, so photons don't have mass.</p>
<p>This is how lasers work, electrons are energized so that they drop again, releasing a photon. There's technologi-magical bits to that I don't really know anything about beyond that.</p>
<p>It's also the basis behind our high energy particle physics. You can accelerate bits of mass, either nuclei or electrons, depending on your type of accelerator, to a fraction the speed of light. There's some limit you can't move it faster, but you can give it additional momentum, which makes the particle heavier. It's an expression of how much energy is stored in that particle, really large field values. Then you smack two such particles together in a head on collision, typically both going at the same speed in opposite directions so you can double the energy of the collision, though shooting these things at a fixed target is also a thing for other research. Compressing these particles together means you're concentrating a shit-ton of energy in the fields they interact with. And those fields are going to have a proportional amount of energy they dump into the adjacent fields they interact with. So on, and so on, and so on... And if you can get enough energy to trickle down into more obscure, more weakly interacting fields, you can get a particle to pop into existence, if only for a moment. Detecting the speed, direction, spin, orientation, duration, and decay products, and how they move and behave, we can deduce a lot about these fields and come to a more complete understanding of our reality. We will continue to do this, building bigger and more powerful accelerators, until it becomes infeasible to build them or find anything new, or until someone comes up with a better idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
