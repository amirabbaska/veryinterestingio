		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;increasing forests.&quot; Short answer is yes: trees are made from carbon and so increasing the total biomass of all Earth trees (through growth or new saplings) by 1.5% would capture last year's carbon emissions. </p>
<p>Increasing the total number of trees, or the proportion of earth's surface covered by forests, by 1.5% is a different proposition than increasing biomass... think about the difference between watching a giant oak grow 1.5% dry weight (start with one tree, end with one tree, but meet the carbon target) as opposed to planting an equivalent mass of new saplings (start with one tree, now have fifteen trees, but no growth occurred so carbon target is not met). The difference here is time. For your new saplings to actually put a dent in carbon emissions requires them to grow, which requires time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to meet this target <em>each and every year</em> until our carbon emissions stabilize. 1.5% growth year over year is exponential and wouldn't take too long for us to literally run out of room to plant more forests. To be specific, that means doubling the biomass of all forests on earth every 45 years or so. The concerted effort required by humanity to do so would be a project on a scale never before seen in human history. If we planted two or three saplings for each and every tree already planted in the world, and passed an international resolution making it illegal to cut down any living tree, we would have a small chance at making our first 45 year target.</p>
<p>A related but interesting thing is carbon capture through algae. If I recall correctly, algae is responsible for a huge amount of carbon processing on this planet. Not only does algae grow faster than trees, it takes up a lot less space and the growth/cultivation of algae can be industrialized fairly easily. It may be far more reasonable for humanity to domesticate algae on a large scale (my first thoughts go to growing algae-based foods, producing algae-based paper products, and using algae to make combustible fuels) than to increase forest coverage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The processes of removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it are called &quot;capture&quot; &amp; &quot;sequestration&quot;.  Growing more trees is one of the easiest ways to capture CO2, but even if you manage to increase the Earth's biomass by 1.5%, you then have to worry about maintaining biomass at that higher level.  It's easy for a catastrophic event like a forest fire to release that carbon back into the atmosphere at a future date, so forests are a poor form of sequestration.</p>
<p>There are proposals to store significant amounts of carbon underground through &quot;geological sequestration&quot; (dissolving CO2 into deep-underground salty brines or permanently incorporating it into carbonate rocks).  That's a better form of sequestration, but the &quot;capture&quot; part is more difficult in that scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scenario you are talking about is what has been happening the last decade according to the 20-year study from Nature Climate Change (I don't remember the issue, think it was in '13 or '14). Well, at least to a degree.</p>
<p>There's only so much space for reforestation, there were already errors in the past where governments, farmers and NGOs implemented afforestation policies (planting trees where they don't belong), causing local climate (micro) changes. This can be attributed to a bunch of different factors, but primarily due to changes in the hydrological cycle. </p>
<p><a href="http://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/abs/10.5558/tfc2014-102" target="_blank">http://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/abs/10.5558/tfc2014-102</a></p>
<p>I've seen and talked to some farmers how &quot;new&quot; forests ruined the area, thankfully they are cutting the trees down moderately back to its original state in Southern Ontario, Canada, the impact on wildlife is actually quite astonishing. But this is &quot;anecdotal&quot; since I can't find the damn research online since I doubt they were digitized, unless a Trent researcher or something here can fill in :P </p>
<p>Forests, especially the boreal forest, has a complex dynamic. So much that it isn't advisable to expand them recklessly since they won't solve the problem, once past a certain point, they quickly become carbon emitters instead of carbon sinks.</p>
<p><a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-07-north-american-forests-climate.html" target="_blank">http://phys.org/news/2016-07-north-american-forests-climate.html</a></p>
<p>There's also the fire-growth cycle, which firefighters and biologists are seen the value of. Forests NEED fire to occasionally clear the area for new growth, which is often a large-scale carbon emission event. Additional growth would mean increased frequency and scale of these fires, something that's hard to account for.</p>
<p>China and EU both have afforestation policies, in EU's cases, more likely than not, the afforestation might just be reforestation with some gaps (measured in centuries or even millennia), so there's isn't too much damage even if it's done haphazardly. We do have numerous records of slaves/freemen clearing forests for farm, especially the danes. China on the other hand have putting where forests in inner Mongolia with experimental technologies and techniques, we don't know the effect of it nor will we until decades down the line, but what we do know is that there will be major disruption at the local level, just not sure if it's positive or negative, although quite a few scientists have pointed out the danger of the policies, it's going ahead regardless. ie. changes in soil quality, local wind patterns, wildlife impact, etc...   </p>
<p>This is known as the China's Green Great Wall, the project can be seen at the chinese gov. page </p>

<p>TL;DR. it's VERY complicated involving water, fire, wind, earth and air. Please no cpt. planet jokes. The short term is yes, it'd work, the long term is no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
