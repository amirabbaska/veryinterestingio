		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Your plastic bottle will almost always wind up in a bale of sorted &quot;mixed plastic&quot; in a few days, maybe a week or so. But it's hard to say how long it will be until that bale is processed into recycled plastic granules/pellets and then used to make consumer goods. </p>
<p>Let's start with you putting your plastic bottle in a recycling bin. What happens next?</p>
<p>First, the bin gets collected by a waste management company. This may or may not be the same company that collects non-recyclable garbage in any given area, but it's almost always done with trucks dedicated to recycling. The recycling trucks dump their loads at a recovery facility that may or may not be owned by the same company that owns the trucks. These drop offs occur pretty much all day during business hours, but any given recycling bin is typically only collected once a week. </p>
<p>Second, the recovery facility sorts incoming &quot;mixed material&quot; into different categories using a number of different processes, some automated, some manual. Paper is sorted with an &quot;air knife&quot; that blows it onto a different belt while leaving heavier materials behind. Metals are separated with a magnet (yes, even aluminum, though not in the same way that steel cans are). Rotating drums sort out lighter materials (like plastic) from heavier ones (like glass). And &quot;pickers&quot; remove things like plastic bags, contaminated cardboard, wet/shredded paper, etc., that tend to jam up the machines. Your plastic bottle will most likely end up in a gigantic container containing almost all plastic, sometimes even sorted by plastic type (depends on the facility). The recovery facility will then compact these plastics (mixed or otherwise) into bales, usually of a size appropriate for moving around with a skid loader. This sorting/baling process can potentially run 24/7, depending on how many different waste management companies are dropping off &quot;mixed material&quot; at a particular recovery facility. </p>
<p>So, how long does all of the above take? Well, it could be anywhere from a few minutes to an entire week after you put your bottle in the bin before it gets picked up. But once that happens, it'll probably make its way into a sorted &quot;mixed plastics&quot; bale in less than 24 hours, as recovery facilities try to process material more-or-less as fast as it comes in. Otherwise they'd wind up with an ever-expanding amount of un-sorted material to store!</p>
<p>Recovery facilities sell these bales to plastic recycling companies. Plastic recycling companies take in these bales, sort them (far more carefully than the recovery facility does, and sometimes dividing different kinds of plastic into different production lines), wash them (recovery facility doesn't do that), shred them, and then melt them down to be molded into granules/pellets suitable for use in manufacturing processes. </p>
<p>How long does it take for mixed plastic bales to get recycled? Hard to say. Recovered &quot;mixed plastic&quot; bales are an industrial commodity. Recovery facilities obviously like to move their inventory as fast as possible, but it could be anywhere from a few days to a few weeks before any particular bale gets sold, for any number of reasons not important here. Once a recycler buys a bale, it will typically process it almost right away. But then there's another indefinite period between producing the recycled plastic granules/pellets and selling those on to a manufacturer. Once a manufacturer buys recycled plastic, it's typically used to make consumer products almost right away. But those two delay periods--between compacting a bale and selling it, and between producing recycled plastic granules/pellets and selling those--make it hard to provide a precise estimate. Again, anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. A few <em>months</em> even, if the market in recycled plastic is slow for whatever reason. Shipping takes time too, so add in a day or two for each step. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
