Surely that is enough to ensure pretty much negligable amounts of carbon on earth. According to wikipedia, 1-1.5 per 10^12 cabon atoms are carbon 13 or 14.</p>
<p>So if this is the case for something with a half life as long as carbon 14, then how the hell are their still radioactive elements/isotopes on earth with lower half lives? How do we still pick up trace, but still appreciable, amounts of radioactive elements/isotopes on earth?</p>
<p>Is it correct to assume that no new radioactive particles are being produced on/in earth? and that they have all been produced in space/stars? Or are these trace amount replenished naturally on earth somehow?</p>
<p>I recognize that the math checks out, and that we should still be picking up at least some traces of them. But if you were to look at it from the perspective of a individual Cesium or Phosphorus-32 atoms it seems so unlikely that they just happen to survive so many potential opportunities to just decay and get entirely wiped out on earth.</p>
<p>I get that radioactive decay is asymptotic, and that theoretically there should always be SOME of these molecules left, but in the real world this seems improbable. Are there other factors I'm missing?</p></div></div>

<ul>
<li>bombardment of the atmosphere by cosmic rays (high energy particles). A examples are Carbon-14, or Hydrogen-3.</li>
<li>as decay products of long-lived isotopes. For example, U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, so still exists on earth, and so its decay products also exist, even though they are short-lived themselves. </li>
</ul>
<p>Radionuclides which have a short half-life and are not found in decay chains of longer-lived isotopes are, indeed, not found naturally on earth, except in tiny trace amounts; for example, pretty much any isotope of Technetium</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, in the case of carbon-14, it is constantly being made in our atmosphere by cosmic rays striking nitrogen-14 and changing it. Sort of like how we can make new medically-useful isotopes by putting non-radioactive things into a nuclear reactor for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Carbon-14 is produced constantly in the upper atmosphere from the interaction of high-energy cosmic particles with nitrogen-14.</p>
<p>It has also been produced in other high-energy interactions (nuclear explosions from atomic tests), which is why in 14C-dating, we set the &quot;present&quot; in &quot;before present&quot; at 1950, after which the amount of 14C in the atmosphere was no longer solely the product of natural processes.</p>
<p>We also know now that 14C is not produced at a constant rate, but that the amount produced through the interaction of 14N with cosmic rays is variable. This is why we have to run a calibration on 14C dating results to convert 14C years to calendar years. At some points in the past, 14C years area almost 1:1 with calendar years (around about 2900 years ago, for example, 14C years are roughly similar to calendar years: 2900 +/- 30 rcybp ~ 3037 +/- 53 cal BP). At others, the difference in 14C years and calendar years can be pretty significant.</p>
<p>8900 +/- 80 rcybp ~ 9994 +/- 136 cal BP.</p>
<p>The calibration curve is being constantly refined and updated. The last major refinement is the <a href="http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal13.htm" target="_blank">IntCal13 curve</a>, produced in 2013. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Carbon 14 turns into Nitrogen 14, for example.
