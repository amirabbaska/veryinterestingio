		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear material produces heat as it decays. This heat gets converted to electric energy by something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">Seebeck Effect</a>. This is the phenomenon where you join two dissimilar metals together then apply heat to the junction which will produce a small DC voltage across the junction.  If you stack thousands of these junctions together you will obtain significant voltage. </p>
<p>The same effect can be exploited in reverse to cool things like electronics. The device that does this is called a Peltier Cooler. It consists of thousands of these thermal junctions made up of dissimilar metals just like the Voyager RTGs. If you apply current trough it one side will get hot and the other side will get cold. Same thing works in reverse, if you apply heat to one side you will get some voltage across the device.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the earliest of these devices were in vogue during the tube radio era. There were<a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/thermoelectric/thermoelectric.htm#rl" target="_blank"> thermoelectric</a> generators you could attach to an oil lamp and that would be enough to power your radio as well as light up your room. These were really popular in rural <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LPbSZT7.jpg" target="_blank">Russia</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Voyager spacecraft are powered  by Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG).  An RTG  utilizes thermoelectric devices
which convert a temperature gradient into an electrical voltage via the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect/" target="_blank">thermoelectric effect</a>.</p>
<p>Each RTG contained about 4.5 kg of Pu^238 in the form of 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres which initially generated 2400 W (thermal). Conversion of this decay heat to electrical power uses 312 silicon-germanium thermocouples with a temperature gradient (initially)  of 700° C.  (1000° C. hot, 300° C. cold) which produced about 157 W (electrical) at 30 volts.</p>
<p>Each Voyager contains 3 RTGs which together provided about 470 W of electrical power at launch.  About one half of a Pu^238 half-life has elapsed since launch, meaning around 70% of the plutonium remains.  In January 2015, when JPL ceased publishing their weekly Voyager status reports, the power output had dropped to 255 W.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically it has a chunk of nuclear material aboard, which slowly decays. As it does, it heats up somewhat. An onboard thermo-electric generator (basically a device that converts heat flow to electricity) then generates electricity to keep it running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small quibble: it doesn't count as a nuclear reactor, because there isn't a chain reaction, only natural decay.</p>
<p>Breaking it down to fundamentals: </p>
<p>Heat flows by all mechanisms it is allowed: light (usually only infrared, unless something is red hot or hotter), sound (typically <em>very</em> high frequency &amp; low-amplitude white noise, which is how diamonds conduct heat so well), atoms (especially convection currents), or charge carriers (which is how copper and aluminum conduct heat so well).</p>
<p>The RTGs contain the heat of decaying plutonium, and give that heat an opportunity to flow in the form of charge carriers out to a heat sink that radiates it out into space. It isn't a particularly efficient way to make electricity, and it requires a fairly steep thermal gradient to work well, but it's extremely reliable and long-lasting, especially for the total weight of the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
