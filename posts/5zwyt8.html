		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <em>President</em> didn't even have term limits for almost 200 years. The reasoning behind that is that the President is 1/3 of the government by himself, as well as the commander in chief of the military. That power can be abused, especially by a president who stays in office for many years and uses his power to weaken political opponents.</p>
<p>By contrast, a Senator or Congressman is just 1/100 or 1/435. Even the most powerful of them can't really do much on their own. </p>
<p>I personally don't believe in congressional term limits, because the people should take the responsibility of monitoring their representatives and replacing them when necessary. Term limits are a lazy and half-assed way to avoid that responsibility.</p>
<p>Lastly, former members of the military do get lifelong healthcare if they're wounded in action. Additionally, anyone who retires from the military can stay on the government's plan for cheap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The positive case against term limits goes like this:</p>
<p>Ultimately you want people in government to be able to govern effectively.  Legislators need to be good at the job they do to ensure good governance, and a large part of being good at your job is experience doing your job.  For this reason, a representative who has served for 20 years will likely be more effective at serving his or her constituents and country than one freshly elected.  Take, say, a committee which deals with national security issues. Arguably a representative who has been receiving classified briefings for twenty years will have a better understanding of the context in which new information is presented than a representative who only started receiving classified briefings six months ago.  The experienced representative will be better able to understand how important a particular piece of intelligence is, whether something is normal or remarkable.</p>
<p>The other factor is who you <em>don't or can't</em> limit the terms of. Civil servants have their careers for life, unless they do something specific to get them fired.  It's their job to know their departments inside and out, and as they become more senior they get to know other departments workings too, and get to know other senior civil servants.  This is critical to the efficient functioning of our governments, it ensures continuity between administrations, it ensures problems can get resolved, it ensures representatives can be properly briefed on what's happening in the actual engine of government, so correct policy decisions can be made. It takes decades to make a good and experienced civil servant who can keep a government department running, and it's still basically just a regular career so you probably don't want to put term limits on these jobs.  If there are strict term limits on elected representatives, this breaks the chain somewhat between the elected and unelected portions of our governments.  If representatives don't have a clear and solid grasp on what government departments do and how they operate, a lot of the actual power in government then falls into the hands of unelected civil servants, who are able to run rings around the inexperienced representatives they're theoretically accountable to.</p>
<p>And lastly, lobbyists.  You <em>can't</em> put a term limit on a lobbyist.  Lobbyists influence all politicians, regardless of whether they're new or long-standing, but arguably lobbyists influence new representatives more than they can experienced ones.  When a new rep gets to the legislature, they don't know the ins and outs of how the system works, they don't know the back channels, they don't know who to talk to in order to get x or y done.  Generally the experienced members of the party will help with that, but what if there are no members of the party with a decade in the legislature, due to term limits?  Well, along comes a lobbyist, a former legislator who now works for Big [Industry You Don't Like].  He offers to take the new legislator under his wing, show him how things work, smooth over a few things.  Before you know it the new legislator has the lobbyist as his mentor, and so lobbyists find it even easier than they do now to influence government policy to their liking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that's not to say there aren't counterpoints to these arguments, and others have covered more cynical reasons for it to be as it is, and there are definitely arguments <em>for</em> term limits which I haven't covered because you've asked for the opposite, but the above is the basic outline of how those opposed to term limits would argue the merits of having legislators with long service.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Experience is a valuable commodity in politics.  We want our legislators to be experienced enough to govern in our interest, and we want the people with the most experience to be the ones we can directly control through elections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>had a government professor in college who was an expert at keeping his political opinions a mystery, but he did take a very firm stand against congressional term limits.</p>
<p>His two biggest points were that it was undemocratic for the government to take away the people's choice of their elected officials and that it was unnecessary because the average person only serves about 10-15 years in Congress. That means most people who serve only spend a fraction of their working years in Congress. That's only two or three elections for a senator. There are a few extremes, but in general there is already high turnover in Congress. Occasionally I see a Facebook post claiming that serving just one term gets you a lifelong pension, but that's not the case. You have to put in a lot of time to pull a full pension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Title vs actual text - pick <em>one.</em></p>
<p>If the people like their representative, why shouldn't they be able to keep re-electing them if they feel they are doing a good job and voting the way they want them to? </p>
<p>My own rep is Maxine Waters, who is a bit of an embarrassment but I sure as shit would rather have her than <em>ANY</em> Republican (or some dipshit Green for that matter) because I know that she has consistently voted 100% they way I want her to vote on the bills that matter most. And 90% on the rest. </p>
<p>While <em>Congress</em> might get low marks on the whole, people like their own Representatives much better. At least the <em>majority</em> of those in a district like their reps. </p>
<p><strong>Term limits have very bad unintended consequences, namely lobbyists REALLY start writing the laws.</strong>  Just take a look at my state of California, which stupidly passed term limit laws and now most of our really important laws dealing with major industries are written by the lobbyists for those industries. </p>
<p>Why? Because with term limits not only do the legislators not have time to learn either their jobs or the issues they have to govern over, but they worry about what <strong><em>job</em></strong> they are going to have when it's over. Lobbyists are very good about dangling post-office positions in front of these A-holes to get them to vote in their favor. Without term limits, the <strong>public</strong> has the job they want to keep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>The long answer:</strong> there's three factors that cause this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Congress makes the laws. We've elected people who don't think term limits are a good idea, and most of them really like being in congress, so they don't want to kick themselves out.</li>
<li>Most people wouldn't like being in congress. They've made it so that 50% of the job is begging for money, and politics are currently extremely partisan and bitter. There's just not many people who want that job, so many candidates run unopposed.</li>
<li>Most incumbents get re-elected even though congress has dismal approval ratings. The most likely explanation might just be that name recognition matters. People who have been there for a long time are recognized and they also have the connections and donors to buy ads to make sure people remember who they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the kind of people who enjoy being politicians have turned the job in to something that has bushy pay and benefits, but would also drive most people insane. And most people are too lazy or indifferent to care, so they just let the nutters in congress stay there. If we had term limits maybe things would be different, but we don't, so they aren't.</p>
<p><strong>The short answer:</strong> campaign finance in the US is messed up, the people who know how to work the system get to stay and make the rules about how things get run. The people who can't (or won't) abuse the current system don't get a say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
