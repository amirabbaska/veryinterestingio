		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok several reasons here, a lot of it down to the style of fighting, so will try to cover some of it.</p>
<p>1) A curved blade is easier to draw on horseback due to the lack of space. Eastern armies used to have more troops mounted and on smaller horses so this was more of an issue.</p>
<p>2) A curved blade has the centre of balance more towards the tip meaning a slashing blow would do more damage. It also meant that for the same weight of sword it could be made longer. This allowed lightly armed mounted troops to slash rapidly a few times and gallop away. Western mounted troops were intended to blast through the opposing troops rather than harass.</p>
<p>3) A curved blade though lacks the penetrating power of a straight blade against thick armour, western armies were more likely to encounter heavily armoured opposition (or heavy shields).</p>
<p>4) Western troops would sometimes fight dismounted to form a shield wall, whilst curved blades can be used on foot they are not able as easily to be used in a wall like formation where the straight blade can be used in a coordinated stabbing motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My conjecture is development in armour.</p>
<p>Curved weapons are better for slashing. To slash the blade needs to be drawn across the target and the closer this is to perpendicular the better. A curved blade makes this easier.</p>
<p>The thing is, slashing is useless against armour. For that you need penetrating weapons or bludgeoning weapons. For the former, something that stabs, and for the latter, something which bashes to cause soft tissue injury and broken bones. A western longsword allows for both. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I am not a professional historian, nor was I alive during the time these weapons were used. Therefore, much of the following is reasonably educated speculation rather than indubitable fact. </p>
<p>More specifically about the European vs Middle Eastern weapons (longsword vs yatagan/shamshir):</p>
<p>Warfare in Europe, basically from the Roman Empire until the development of the flintlock, was dominated by heavy forces. Heavy infantry such as Roman legions, Swiss pike squares, or landsknechts, and armored cavalry (knights) were the decisive units of virtually every war waged in Europe.</p>
<p>Even basic chainmail or brigandine is nearly impossible to cut through with a sword that is usable by an ordinary person, and a shield can easily bind a blade that cuts into it, rendering the sword's wielder vulnerable to their opponent. Thrusts, however, especially with a straight, tapering blade, can pierce mail or even the joints of heavy plate armor with relative ease. Thus, especially in later sword types, European swords developed an straight blade with the ability to thrust effectively.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, however, light cavalry was the dominant force on the battlefield. The Arabian horse, which is typically small, but very fast and resilient, was well suited to light cavalry warfare, as was the  relatively open terrain characteristic of the Middle East. Facing opponents who were wearing light armor and with whom combat would likely be a series of skirmishes rather than the head-to-head slugging match characteristic of European battles, blades such as the yatagan, shamshir, and mameluke sword, which are light (therefore less tiring to use in multiple skirmishes), agile (therefore suited to fighting between cavalrymen), and adapted for slashing evolved.</p>
<p>Notably, slashing and thrusting also have very different effects on the target. A thrust tends to penetrate deeply and leave a small surface wound,, which is excellent for piercing armor. Thrusts also are quite reliable for inflicting fatal wounds, as just about any thrust to the torso will hit something important which medical science in the Middle Ages was not able to repair. Slashes, however, have more stopping power and are more likely to incapacitate the opponent immediately, as they are more likely to sever tendons, muscles and/or bones. Also, slashes are easier than thrusts to land, as they create a larger threat zone. </p>
<p>An eventually fatal wound is more acceptable in the case of a set-piece battle such as those common in Europe, as the soldier who was wounded would likely have a field hospital relatively nearby which might be able to stitch shut a slash to the leg, but wouldn't be able to remedy a stab to the liver. However, in a skirmish-type battle, a slashing wound which rapidly incapacitates the opponent is preferable, as immediate medical help is unlikely to arrive and ensuring that the opponent can't carry on fighting for a while is quite desirable due to the larger percentage of the opposing force that one man represents.</p>
<p>A final note, and less related, is that the sword was rarely the primary weapon of any soldier. Generally, the spear/pike/lance or longbow/crossbow/horsebow was a soldier's main weapon, with the sword, mace, or warhammer as a backup to be drawn once the enemy had closed to a range that nullified the primary or the primary was lost or rendered unusable by damage or lack of ammunition.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Swords in Europe developed for set-piece battles between heavy forces, with an emphasis on thrusts to defeat heavy armor and inflict deep stab wounds. Swords in the Middle East evolved for light cavalry warfare with an emphasis on slashing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're sort of generalising the equipment used by &quot;eastern armies&quot; here. Different peoples across Asia use different weapons. In the Middle East, nobody ever used curved swords until they were introduced by the central asian Turks in the early Middle Ages (Unless you count the Assyrian sickle-sword). So, the scimitar, which we so associate with the peoples of the middle east, and with Islam, didn't actually originate there and didn't come into use until fairly late into the regions history. The early Arab armies of the Rashidun caliphate used straight swords, and before that, the Sassanid Persians had their own type of straight longsword with a trigger style grip. <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00032/AN00032326_001_l.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00032/AN00032326_001_l.jpg</a></p>
<p>In China, they have a history of using straight swords as well. You may already be familiar with the Jian. Early Chinese swords looked a bit like this <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b1/2d/4c/b12d4c39ab6b98155facabd65f641c15.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b1/2d/4c/b12d4c39ab6b98155facabd65f641c15.jpg</a></p>
<p>The same applies in India, curved swords were introduced late, they've been using straight swords since the Iron Age. Here is a Khanda sword, which I believe is one the oldest types of Indian sword.
<a href="http://www.swordhistory.info/wp-content/uploads/khanda-sword.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.swordhistory.info/wp-content/uploads/khanda-sword.jpg</a></p>
<p>To answer the question.. because Turks, mostly. I may be wrong, but it seems the curved sword has it's origins in the steppe with the Turkic and Mongol peoples, and it was they who introduced it to  the great powers of Asia. Why did the Turks and Mongols prefer it? Probably because it's easier to use on horseback. Then, when they came to dominate the middle-east, they brought their curved swords with them, and it stuck.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
