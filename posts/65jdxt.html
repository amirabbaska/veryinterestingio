Edit2: Can you guys stop asking personal questions like if I'm a murderer or not? Edit3: Okay, the word venom is used for bite/slash, poison is used for ingesting. I'm just using &quot;Poison&quot; because it's the more common word used to describe both acts.</p></div></div>

The effect is somewhat like when you have fruit juice that's dried to a laminate counter. Somewhat sticky and easily dissolved or removed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically I believe weapons that were coated in actual venom or poison were allowed to air dry. However its a lot easier and cheaper to smear shit on your arrows and that bacteria is obviously bad news if it finds a new home in an open wound</p>
<p>Edit: apparently obligatory <em>I'm not a fucking expert and most of my knowledge comes from historical fiction of varying degrees of accuracy</em></p>
<p>Edit: removal of distinction of poison vs venom, it was irrelevant here. My apologies</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to be focused on the physics of it, just think about how dirty cars get - and stay - even though they regularly reach high speeds.  Dirt, mud, bugs, bird poop, and even exhaust particles get on there and require specific conditions to be removed.  Even driving quickly through rain doesn't do much to clean a car.  Matter tends to get stuck to matter (with the exception of repellant substances, e.g. oil vs water), including at the microscopic level.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The San people of southern Africa are likely some of the earliest users of poisoned arrows, IIRC there have been arrowheads found with poison residues on them from 50,000 years ago.  They use a number of poisonous plants in their recipes, but the most effective toxin comes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamphidia" target="_blank">from the larva of a small beetle</a>.  The beetle larva is harmless if eaten, unless you have a cut in your mouth.  You can imagine what happened to the poor guy who first discovered this.</p>
<p>The way that the San (who still hunt with poisoned arrows today) get the poison to stick is that their recipe always includes some resin from the acacia tree.  This acacia gum is a very effective glue when it dries, so they basically first make poisoned glue and then apply it to the arrowheads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
