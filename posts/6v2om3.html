		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Apologies in advance for a lack of scientific sourcing. If you would like anything sourced better, let me know.</em></p>
<p>Coral &quot;bleaching&quot; is the algae having left the &quot;coral&quot;. That is, the coral itself is literally the skeleton, so being &quot;bleached&quot; is literally  to be dead.</p>
<p><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html" target="_blank">https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html</a></p>
<p>But, since the &quot;coral&quot; is [mostly] just the skeleton, new algae can be reintroduced to the skeleton. However, if the cause is not mitigated, then recolonization of the coral is very unlikely. Whatever caused it to bleach, would prevent it from coming back. In this case, the main causes seem to be particulate pollution (eg sediments), increased temperature, increased acidity and increased nitrogen.</p>
<p>edit/correction: As per /u/Wog, the coral is the skeleton of an animal, collectively known as &quot;polyps&quot;. It is the algae that give coral their color, so bleaching is the algae leaving or dying. The polyp, which relies on the algae for food, will die soon after, though some have other means of feeding. As per the below source, corals can recover if some polyps in protected areas manage to survive. However, the coral is actually alive, and can actually die, rather than just being host to things that die. /edit</p>

<p>The latest survey shows 900 miles (of ~1,400) have bleached <em>since 2016</em>. See the below source for a nice &quot;bleached - not bleached&quot; map. I'm searching for an overall percentage, but most either address a certain section (eg the northern portion or shallow-water portions), are for a certain time-frame, or address &quot;bleaching&quot; rather than &quot;bleached&quot;. I will edit if I can find one.</p>

<p>Whether it can be saved is more of a political question - given enough resources and global commitment, certainly humanity is capable. Actual steps being taken are to decrease various pollutants in run-off, which can include the run-off itself (eg fresh water), sediment erosion and fertilizers. (Sorry, I recognize this is a partial answer. Hopefully, someone else can fill in how much will be required over current efforts to stave off further destruction.)</p>

<p>So there is hope I guess, but the government is more interested in money than the well being of the reef. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About 1/3 of the GBR has died over the past 20 years, and the other two thirds are projected to also die over the next 50 or so years.</p>
<p>Some google searches and any library can provide this information.  It probably cannot be saved seeing as climate change is possibly the largest factor in its demise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
