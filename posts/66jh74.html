		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already pretty good comments and references, but I wanna point out some information that is not always considered.</p>
<p>First, the facts. She was a born in the mid 19^th century, the youngest daughter of a science teacher from a formerly well-off family. She was catholic (despite the rumors that she might have been jewish, a pretty extended idea among the people who hated her). She studied under great, well known scientists at the time (like Lippman, who managed to get the first color photography, and Becquerel, who discovered and studied radioactive decay).</p>
<p>It'd be easy to say that she's famous because she earned two Nobel prices, but there has been a bunch of people who got also two Nobel prices who aren't nearly as renowned as she is. (John Bardeen inveted the transistor and studied a important phenomenon known as superconductivity, and Frederick Sanger worked with DNA and proteins, to name a few). Linus Pauling is probably more famous than those two, but I don't think he's as famous as Ms. Curie. (He got a Nobel prize in Chemistry for his works on the nature of chemical bonds, and he also got a Peace Nobel prize). </p>
<p>The fact is that she is a very well known historic figure because she was a woman. Her life was a lot harder than that of men who could've achieved the same things as her. She managed to discover fundamental physical phenomena as well as two elements, and did so while suffering depression for almost all her life, became mother of two, lost a husband and lived in a turbulent time and place.</p>
<p>As a curiosity: one of her daughters, Irene, won a Nobel prize in physics and died of leukemia before turning 60. Eve, her other daughter, became a writer and lived to be more than 100 years old (she died in  the mid 2000's or so).</p>
<p>So my guess is that she's famous because her life was a constant struggle and even yet she found a way to be a remarkable person who gave her life for science (in more than a sense). </p>
<p>Sorry if my English is a bit off, I'm tired and I'm speaking from memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>not the first woman to win a nobel prize</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only won 1 nobel prize rather than 2</p>
</li>
<li>died in 1906 from traffic accident so any later accomplishments in life wouldnt be possible</li>
</ol>
<p>marie's life was a lot harder than pierre's.</p>
<p>people who are actually knowledgeable about science history know pierre.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
