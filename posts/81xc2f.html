		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is exactly the same process as restrictions in the tidal flow caused by the continents being in the way. It adds more &quot;friction&quot; to the system (tidal dissipation) and will result in the tidal bulge being dragged further round (since the Earth spins faster than the Moon orbits). This means we would get an increased slowing of the Earths rotation due to increased tidal dissipation and more energy transferred to the Moon increasing its orbital distance. Of course this effect would be so negligible as to be immeasurable over even a few thousand years even if we increased our tidal energy production significantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit* I REALLY want to add anything humans do would be completely negligible! The tidal dissipation in the Earth naturally is so small that the Earth-Moon system will not reach tidal equilibrium for many billions of years. Humans do not have the capability of building structures to increase this by any real measurable amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit2*
Given some of the response about &quot;we made small changes before and look at climate change&quot; lets consider the tidal system and how realistic it would be for humans to change the orbital evolution of the Earth-Moon system significantly. </p>
<p>The easiest thing to look at is what the natural rate of evolution is. The day on Earth lengthens by about 1.7 milliseconds per 100 years. What is more while the Earth slows the Moon moves away from us. This further slows the rate at which the Earths rotation slows. In fact the transfer of energy from the Earth to the moon is proportional to 1/r^6 where r is the orbital distance of the Moon. So basically the Moons moving away from us slows down (as does the slow down of the Earth). </p>
<p>Now if we consider that the transfer of energy in the system is dominated by seabed surface area and think to ourselves, &quot;How much could we increase the surface area by?&quot;. The oceans cover 71% of the surface of the Earth but this is a near uniform level. So in order to have a significant effect this is what we are competing against.</p>
<p>Now couple these two things together. You have a natural process that acts on timescales of millions/billions of years (unlike the climate which acts on timescales of years) where we can only hope to increase its effect by an immeasurable amount (literally due to it being so small that the natural variation in length of day due to super-rotation of the Earths core being larger than the increase we could impart).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are gettin a lot of half-right answers here. The moon/Earth system is exchanging energy through the activation of tides. This changes the orbit of the moon and the rotation of the Earth. But once the energy is in the tide, it doesn't matter where it goes. Whether the tides impact the coasts, or are absorbed by humans to make electricity, it still just ends up as heat. The moon/Earth system will be unaffected. There would be less coastal erosion, and less beach building going on though. Tidal energy is not free energy, but just energy that will be spent anyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We slow down the Earth, and push the Moon further away.</p>
<p>Tides - whether we extract energy from them or not - slow down the Earths' rotation. In the process, it 'tries' to accelerate the moon. But instead the moon is pushed into a higher orbit, and a higher orbit is a slower one. </p>
<p>So the energy from the Earth's spin goes to heat in friction by moving water (and the energy we extract), and gravitational potential from a higher lunar orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rocks that the tides would have hit to make more sand or sediment; and a reduced kinetic energy in the system, so turbulence and wave speeds would be ever so slightly reduced.  The earth and moon tidal system is encompassing this system, so the energy harvest is coming from entropy that is dissipating anyway.  Kind of like, whether solar panels or vegetation slow down  cosmic motion due to absorbing photons rather than receiving an impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
