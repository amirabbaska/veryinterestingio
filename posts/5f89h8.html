It was Einstein who took his Law at face value and ran with it (much like he did with Maxwell's Equations, actually), AFAIK Planck believed it was just a mathematical trick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>His knowledge of math. He knew that if he introduces energy as an integer multiplier of something proportional to the frequnecy into the Boltzmann statisctis, he would get rid of the classical failure that earlier researcher fell into. For the long time he believed this to be nothing more than a mathematical trick that does the job - with no physical meaning. Only 5years later Einstein showed in his photoeffects explanation that this is the actual way the nature works - radiation really does come in discrete chunks. </p>
<p>I was concerned with the very same question some time ago and this pretty illustrative video has helped me understand it on math level : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCUnoxJ5pho&index=2&list=PL193BC0532FE7B02C" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCUnoxJ5pho&index=2&list=PL193BC0532FE7B02C</a>
The whole series on QM is worth watchting if you're trying to grasp the principles of the topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a mathematical trick at first to deal with an issue in blackbody radiation. In Newtonian physics, energy is considered to be infinitely divisible, so when an equation was written to describe blackbody radiation it included all these infinitely downward divisions. Up to the high points of visible light this is roughly ok, however once you hit ultraviolet light levels, the energy in all these miniscule division quickly run off the chart and thus you have the Ultraviolet Castastrophe.</p>
<p>Max Planck made one adjustment to the equation, setting it so that all possible energy levels were addition to a 'lowest' possible division, the quanta. He didn't know what this smallest part was, and I believe he thought it would turn out to be 0 (hence no smallest part).</p>
<p>The new equation solved the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, Einstein then realized that the quantized energy was due to light itself being a particle, thus a quanta. Bohr jumped in with the quantum leap of electrons which explained the reason of the spectrum energy levels, and thus Quantum Theory began to take form, much to everyone's chagrin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He tried to see if he could match the experimental results by assuming it's quantized and taking the limit as the energy of a photon approaches zero. He noticed that the curve you end up with isn't correct in the limit, but it <em>is</em> correct for a small but finite energy of a photon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
