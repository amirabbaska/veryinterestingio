<p>All images like that described as showing our galaxy are either digitally (or manually) produced images, or images of other galaxies similar to ours.</p>
<p>We can see the milky way in our sky, and being on the outer limb of one of the arms we see it as a broad band of stars dominating one hemisphere of sky. It's in profile. We have no photograph taken that shows the milky way in plan view.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean pictures like <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/milky_way.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> (&quot;Top down view&quot; of entire Milky Way galaxy,) rather than pictures like <a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/images/mt-hood-stars-milky-way_k9a3290.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> (View of the sky with the Milky Way visible going up from the horizon.)</p>
<p>Assuming you mean the first kind - that's an &quot;artist conception&quot; of what we believe the Milky Way would look like if we were to have that angle on it.  And our understanding of our own galaxy changes all the time!  Only recently (2005!) was it fully proven that our galaxy is a &quot;barred spiral&quot; rather than an &quot;ordinary spiral.&quot;  And that was only even theorized in the mid '90s.  Artist conceptions of our galaxy from the '80s or earlier look different from ones now.</p>
<p>We can learn the general shape of the galaxy by observing the sky with very sensitive telescopes, and measuring the distance to the stars, nebulae, etc.  Over time, this has let us build a pretty accurate &quot;map&quot; of our galaxy.  There are some &quot;holes&quot; in our knowledge that we just have to guess at - the galactic core is very dense, so we can't see what is directly opposite the core from us.  And there are some large nebulae and gas clouds that block our view of other areas.  But we have a good idea of what is behind those &quot;walls&quot; because the galaxy does tend to be similar in all parts.</p>
<p>As OrbitalPete pointed out, it's like being in the wilderness, and taking pictures all around, then using a computer to analyze the pictures and build a 3D model of the forest around you.  Yes, that hill off to the North blocks your view behind it, so you'll just have to guess what's over there, but you can build a decently accurate map.</p>
<p>Ironically, it's the same basic technique the Microsoft Kinect uses to figure out where the user is in the room!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QrnwoO1-8A" target="_blank">This video</a> gives a great demo of a Kinect doing just that.  The black &quot;shadows&quot; are where the Kinect can't see through something.  He did later figure out how to use two Kinects to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-w7UXCAUJE" target="_blank">less &quot;shadow&quot;</a>. Astronomers are attempting to do something slightly similar by putting telescopes in orbit around the sun, at the distance of Earth's orbit, but on opposite sides of the orbit from each other - to get Earth-orbit-sized parallax. Not quite as good as the two Kinects since they are &quot;farther apart&quot; from an angular distance to their target.  But still decent.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO" target="_blank">STEREO</a> satellite observatories are similar, but they are facing inward to the Sun, rather than outward to the galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking pictures of the Milky Way is like taking pictures of the ceiling in your house. You aren't seeing the outside; you're seeing the inside. Any pictures of the entire galaxy are fake. They're made by artists using data we have from our own galaxy and others. It gives us a rough estimate of what the Milky Way looks like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are in the outer spiral arm of the Milky Way. The photos you see are looking towards the center. </p>
<p>It also helps if you remember that we are on a sphere, so when you look &quot;up&quot; at least in North America, you are really looking out and away from the side of the Earth.  Because we stand sideways.  Hard to wrap your brain around it.</p>
<p>Its like imagining yourself standing on a huge starfish.  You can take pictures of the center of the starfish and the arms next to you, but you can't take pics of the other side of it.</p>
<p>However, knowing what your side looks like, you can kind of guess what the other wide should look like as well.  And with infrared and radio telescopes, we can see through the galaxy to the other side and get a glimpse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
