		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 for synthetic meat.  First you want to start by clearing up the terminology a bit which might be leading to some confusion.  The meat itself is being called 'synthetic' because it's not coming directly from the standard source IE. a living creature.<br />
Essentially at its most basic level how synthetic meat is produced is as follows.  Proprietor cells are taken from the type of organism whose meat you wish to replicate.  In my example I'll use some beef.  So some cow muscle cells are extracted from an animal and then they are placed on a template in a specific arrangement so that as they grow and replicate they will form muscle spindles and fibres.  For the sake of a simple explanation think of this template as a 3D printed petri dish with special shelves for the cells.  Once the scaffolding has been completed and the cow muscle cells are ready to start growing the template is bathed in a lab developed solution which contains all the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients required for the muscle cells to develop into full articulated structures.  In normal meat production this is done by feeding the cow as it grows and allowing the cows body to replicate the cells and form all the structures.  The muscle cells absorb the nutrients from the &quot;lab broth&quot; and grow into a product which has similar nutritional properties to actual meat.
After the meat has fully developed into its final cellular structures it is then harvested and undergoes a variety of chemical and mechanical processing treatments to make it food ready.  Think of this stage as being similar to grinding up regular meat to make ground beef for patties.<br />
And voila!  You've got your synthetic meat.  </p>
<p>TLDR; Synthetic meat is real meat but it's called synthetic because its grown in a dish instead of on a cow.  The original cells taken to grown the meat are taken from the animal and the meat is &quot;fed&quot; through a nutrient broth allowing it to grow in much the same way the animal would being fed its normal diet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two questions - doing my best to ELI5 them both.</p>
<p>1st Question:</p>
<p>Imagine you have decided to sell jelly beans - but you have a friend who sells them too. He is your competition. Jimmy grows his jellybeans on plants, but when he picks the jelly beans the plants die. It takes a long time for Jimmy's jelly bean plant to grow and it requires a lot of water and fertilizer to keep them growing.</p>
<p>You found a way to grow your jelly beans inside of a metal container. However, you're still trying to make sure that the jelly beans taste as good as Jimmy's. You're close but you need a bit more time. Once you have this figured out you can scale up your efforts and quite possible outsell and outproduce Jimmy. </p>
<p>2nd Question: </p>
<p>You and Jimmy both grow jelly beans. They are made of the exact same material whether they are grown on the plant or grown in your metal vat. One will be as healthy as the other. </p>
<p>Non-ELI5: Companies working on this have almost gotten the taste correct and are working on bringing down the price and improving the flavor. Once they do this they can ramp up production and potentially shave off the costs competing directly with beef farming practices. </p>
<p>Since at the cellular level synthetic or lab grown beef is the same biological material as actual dead cow, the cells are as beneficial/harmful as the ones you eat today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best overview I've found is at:
<a href="http://elliot-swartz.squarespace.com/science-related/invitromeat" target="_blank">http://elliot-swartz.squarespace.com/science-related/invitromeat</a></p>
<p>Right now, it looks like the biggest hurdle is not macro-nutrients, vitamins or minerals. It's hormones and other serum proteins that can't be easily synthesized. Basically, it's the things in serum that make it different than, say, a protein-enhanced sports drink.</p>
<p>Some of these animal proteins can be obtained via genetic engineering, but that is expensive as well - consider that recombinant human albumin (from GM rice) runs about $60 dollars a gram (<a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/a9731?lang=en&region=US" target="_blank">https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/a9731?lang=en&region=US</a>). I couldn't find a price for recombinant (non-animal) bovine serum albumin.</p>
<p>An egg has about 2 grams of ovalbumin.</p>
<p>ETA: Only about 60% of cow is sold as beef; the rest has various uses. One is as a source for bovine serum albumin. You can buy this in bulk, at purity suitable for cell culture, for roughly 11$ per gram (<a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/biochemicals/biochemical-products.html?TablePage=103994915" target="_blank">https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/biochemicals/biochemical-products.html?TablePage=103994915</a>). </p>
<p>The current price point for cultured meat might include this relatively cheap animal-based albumin source. The price may well go up using recombinant sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
