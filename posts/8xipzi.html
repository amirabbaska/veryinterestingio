		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water that was carried onto the land by the tsunami retreats backwards into the open sea. This is arguably the most dangerous part of a tsunami. The force of the watermasses can carry lots of debris with it and knock loose lots of objects; Cars, boats, even houses or parts of them at least. People might survive the initial arrival of the wave. They may perhaps hide behind objects so that they are not directly hit. But when the water retreats, everything that is not firmly connected to the ground will be dragged with the water. Debris is thrown around everywhere potentially killing many.
Even if you can survive the debris you will not be able to hold on to anything so you will be simply swept away onto the open ocean.  </p>
<p>What you should know is that tsunamis are not like &quot;normal&quot; waves. They are more like an extremely rapid and big tide. They are not one small wavepeak with a small wavelength, but much more long and drawn out waves. The strength of the pull depends on the amount of water it carries, the momentum and of course also the coastal bathymetry and topography. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that one of the signs that a tsunami is on its way is the initial retreat of the water from the coast. Not sure if every tsunami would have this, as it probably is totally dependent on how it was initially generated. However the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami had this happen before the tsunami arrived, with plenty of video evidence. So if you are at the coast and the water suddenly drops by several tens of meters - <em>run</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tsunamis are fascinating to me, but I have trouble reconciling the descriptions people have of them with any actual footage I can find.  The descriptions, like one in this thread, paint the incoming tsunami as a &quot;wall of water&quot; or something where people hide behind objects to try and avoid the &quot;impact&quot;.</p>
<p>It's not that I think it's any less destructive, but virtually every video I can find of a tsunami is more akin to a really fast rising tide surge.  I mean, you definitely wouldn't want to be caught in it, but there is no &quot;impact&quot;, per se.  Are there different types of tsunamis?  I have just never seen this &quot;wall of water&quot; I always hear described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most interesting parts of my degree was learning about when a tsunami was about to hit the pull back used to happen so quickly and severely that fish would be left on the sand. In less developed countries who didn't know about taunaamis, they would go out to collect the fish and then obviously be in the worst place imaginable for when it actually hit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking if the water recedes just before the tsunami arrives as it does with a normal wave? If so, the answer is yes. And yes, the recession of water is proportional to the size/strength of the subsequent tsunami.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
