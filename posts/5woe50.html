		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar engineer here. Let me explain some of this that's been covered by some people already.</p>
<p><strong>Why Not Solar In Deserts?</strong>
If we are talking a new array away from people, someone has to lay out all of the infrastructure for it to deliver power to the grid. At the same time, someone also needs to figure out how to shut it down when the largest source of power on that power grid fails because pumping electricity into a powered down grid can have disastrous results. This is typically solved in home solar with a fast disconnect, in which if power to the home stops the array ceases function to help the main power company in the area get things going again.</p>
<p>Next is maintenance on the panels. The thing about large constructions in remote areas or even out of the way spaces is that most companies that put something out there intend not to have to come back to it unless they absolutely have to. The issue with this and solar is panels may die, panels need cleaning, sun tracking mountings are expensive as fuck, and you'd have to pay for all the equipment and people to facilitate taking care of all this. The same fast disconnect isn't a great solution at this kind of scale either. Large power systems like this require a lot of extra engineering and planning and sometimes implementing solutions that don't even exist or cannot just be found off the shelf. (Gonna also drop that you'd have to landscape the desert unless you find a really nice flat spot and even then, you may want to have a leveler come through anyways.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a lot that needs to be managed that just aren't realistic to manage. At the same time, anyone who puts an array out somewhere needs a way to make money off it. They probably aren't going to be able to get the power company to pay for large sums of solar power without it being discounted a lot. After all, if I was a power company I don't need to buy power from someone else. The city may not because they are already getting power from the already existing grid owner. Leaving you only able to sell to new developments and offer power along side the power company to homeowners, at which point, why aren't you just an extension of the power company? And the power company does not have an industry interest in solar because fossil fuel is a bigger money industry. (This statement is wrong, check out /u/Halfway_Bayesian <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/decu3tf/" target="_blank">post</a>.) At the same time, your power needs to be as always available as a regular power company for emergencies and panels do not produce much at night.</p>
<p><strong>Future of Solar then?</strong>
I honestly think that the future of solar right now is in residential. Most homes can hold enough panels on their roof to offset all of their electrical costs and for a pretty fair price (about the cost of a car, between $10,000 to $40,000. Consider pricing is on average, $3.50 per watt on a panel.) I've seen in just the last two or three years alone panels going from 225w panels to 290w along side batteries and even solar shingles. The technology is improving fast and we will see a lot more of it in the next few years. However keep in mind too, not every place in the world is geographically suitable for solar power. Locations too far North and too far South won't get great benefits from solar power. Neither would a place that you could essentially call a forest. Solar I don't believe sells well in Canada or states and countries along the same latitude as Washington or Oregon state. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/dect48o/" target="_blank">Check out Huppie's post here.</a> where they discuss solar at these more northern latitudes, I learned something new.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, if you live in Utah with a good South facing roof, 8 modules of 290w are enough to offset 3,000-4,000 kWh of usage at your home. For a lot of small homes, this can be all you use for a year. A lot of solar companies offer their own maintenance services or even equipping an array with other necessities like &quot;critter cages&quot; to keep birds and squirrels out from under your panels. Otherwise, you may have a ton of fried birds under your panels. They get hot.</p>
<p><strong>Problems that Face Solar</strong>
The biggest issue with the solar industry for individuals is electrical companies because they are virtually untouchable. The reason is that they technically own the power grid and if the entire city depends on it, there is nothing that can really be done. A lot of power companies lobby to keep solar out as well. If you do some research, Nevada was a booming industry. Then Warren Buffet's Pacificorp, changed how solar customers pay their bill for having solar. Essentially, they put up a premium that brings your power bill to, still less than before, but not as much savings. On top of that, you're now also buying power from a solar company or paying for panels under a loan or lease. Pacificorp, claims that they lose millions of dollars per year on administrative fees and are recouping that cost from solar customers with this premium. Some electrical companies won't even allow residents they service to have a solar panel system.</p>
<p>There needs to be more policies for solar friendly developments and incentives for the industry. There are some, but there are also powers in the world that are cornering the market on power and do not want solar coming around because so far, solar companies are already undercutting profits from the grid owning electric company. I think there needs to be a lot more cooperation between power companies and solar companies rather than the electrical companies governing and restricting how power is being provided to consumers in an area.</p>
<p>Tldr: <strong>Solar panels require a lot of maintenance, the idea itself has a lot of business and municipal policy issues, and these same issues extend to the entire solar industry. Its much more feasible for residential solar to be happening for society as these same problems tend to be cheaper when costs can be levied on a private customer.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be the one to do that though, do it.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So electricity. It needs to be moved and can only be used as generated without significant infrastructure. So lets just look at moving Electricity from Arizona to say Maine.</p>
<p>Line losses. Electricity needs to be at high voltages to move it. that is why AC won out over DC. Not because Tesla rocked and Edison was a jackwad, but because DC has a limited transmission range. Literally in the couple miles range. </p>
<p>So we need AC. Solar generally makes DC. So the DC needs to be put into a converter that makes the DC into AC. Because we live in reality and not theory or make-believe there will be losses in converting the DC to AC. </p>
<p>Also a line 100 miles (160 kilometres) at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%. So if we ran 765KV line from Arizona to Maine is like 2800 miles long. That is a considerable amount of losses. That comes out to about a 25% or better loss in the transmission of that power. </p>
<p>So to combine the losses in the generation and swap to AC and the line losses you end up losing a huge amount. Additionally at the beginning and the end you have to step up and then step down the voltages. That incurs more losses. So overall the losses from the Sun hitting the PV panels to someone turning on their TV in maine incurs a huge efficiency penalty.</p>
<p>So while the solar source is free, the transmission equipment, transformers, and all the other equipment is not. So now if you take the standard that solar runs at: about 10-25% and apply that and the losses you get huge generation numbers for what would need installed. 11 million MW hours of power were consumed. </p>
<p>So to math this 11,000,000 MWh of power needed. So we need to up the production to account for the losses. So let's divide that up into 365 days of use and 24 hours per day. That comes out to needing an average of 1255 MW of production. Now we add the losses we have to make up for. That comes out to 1794 MW of production. Then we have to throw in the Capacity factor of solar. The industry runs low compared to other power systems. But a plant in Arizona has been hitting 29% so we can use that. that means we need to start with 6185 MW of faceplate capacity. </p>
<p>And we need to be able to store that power. We haven't added storage in yet. Since the solar must be stored some place for when the sun is down. That will add in more losses and therefore more base capacity to meet the needs of the end user. </p>
<p>Agua Caliente is 84 MW of faceplate capacity on 2400 acres. So we need to multiple and we come up with 176,735 acres give or take. That is about 276 sq. miles of solar. </p>
<p>The problem is not with the production of solar electricity. The problem is with storing and moving the solar electricity. The other thing we have not talked about is maintaining grid stability. Thousands of small PV site feeding into a huge grid with nothing to anchor the grid will make it unstable. When a large industrial plant starts a bug line up or a aluminum recycler starts the induction heating process that load has to be absorbed and these small PV suppliers cant handle it. </p>
<p>There are vast engineering problems that need to be solved here. NO it is not impossible, but it needs to be looked at as a whole, not just little pieces. Too many people assume the only thing that needs power is homes and basic lighting and ignore the rest of the grid and the businesses and industry we have in this country. We need a grid they can rely on. The problems are solvable, but not by activists pushing their favorite flavor of solution or the neat product of the day. </p>
<p>Power walls are great. Except for all the drawbacks they have that we ignore. Solar is great except for some of the drawbacks. nuclear is great except for some of the drawbacks. </p>
<p>Ask your self why we are shutting down already operational and carbon free nuclear plants, but are willing to pay extra in taxes to build carbon free NEW renewables. It is stupid. And it ignores the facts of the grid and engineering. Solar cannot be used as abase load. And the technology for storage is more in its infancy than renewables are. And before we can really have any chance of renewables really supplying the whole of the grid, storage has to be solved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who would be doing it? If you're doing it for the public good that's a government project and you need to convince stubborn politicians that it's a good idea. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>If you're expecting to make money you need to deal with ongoing maintenance costs as well as the initial setup (even if initial setup is relatively cheap these days). And then you need to make they money back by selling the power, but what if the price of power goes down because you're providing it in such large amounts?</p>
<p>There are some practical concerns though.</p>
<p>Moving electricity is not free or completely efficient. Distributing power around an entire country ends up wasting a lot of it and requiring strong infrastructure and these problems would be even worse with one central source a far distance from where the power is used.</p>
<p>And what about nighttime? Storing electricity is a problem that has NOT been solved on the type of large scale such as &quot;powering a whole country&quot;. And solar panels on opposite sides of the world somehow covering for each other when one side is in the dark increases the problem of distribution even further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Storage and transportation.<br />
You can keep a barrel of oil for months and it will still be good.<br />
You can cart a barrel of oil halfway across the world and it will still be good. And we do this. A lot.<br />
A barrel also doesn't cost much to make and can be made out of cheap materials.  </p>
<p>Getting solar power from the Sahara to Stuttgart is going to be difficult.<br />
Once it's electricity it has to be used immediately.<br />
Batteries are really expensive and made out of things that are bad for the environment.<br />
Other cheaper things like boiling salt lose energy very quickly.<br />
Building power lines that far will cause a lot of power to be lost on the way.  </p>
<p>Some scientist are working of a way to turn the energy into oil and burn it later, but it's still in the experimental phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost, maintenance.</p>
<p>And the real kicker:  transfer losses and storage.</p>
<p>Not enough people would live near by to be able to maintain it cost effectively.</p>
<p>Sand can cause wear and tear on &quot;things&quot; so you would have to engineer around that.</p>
<p>And no major population centers nearby deserts, typicall, so the amount of power lost on the wire would be very high.</p>
<p>And storage:  would still need to produce power at night.</p>
<p>So a hybrid approach would be cool.</p>
<p>I don't know why they don't put solar collectors on the outsides of the windmills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
