<p><strong>I'm using this space to voice the most popular argument's I've read:</strong></p>
<p>The main arguments seems to be: </p>
<p>1) <strong>If teeth didn't have nerve endings, we could hurt ourselves by trying to eat rocks or bone and not realizing how hard they are, and end up with broken teeth.</strong></p>
<p>If this ever was such a big problem, I wonder, why didn't our teeth evolve to repair themselves the way everything else from our skin to our bones do? Instead of having us live out the rest of our days in a constant state of agony.</p>
<p>I'm sure this horrible pain would make it harder to function and doing things like hunting or having sex would be out of the question.</p>
<p>2) <strong>We need to know when our teeth are infected so we can have them pulled</strong>, but I assume pulling teeth is an act unique to humans due to our consciousness. Tooth nerve endings exist in most(all?) mammals, who can't do a darned thing about it.</p></div></div>
