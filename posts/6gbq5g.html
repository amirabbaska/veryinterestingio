		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety is a reaction to a perceived stressor. Before modern times, a stressor usually came in the form of an imminent physical threat, like a predatory animal stalking you. The body enters fight or flight mode and most everything else is shut down, including appetite (sexual function being another example). Why worry about eating or sex when your immediate survival is threatened? </p>
<p>10s of thousands of years later, we still have the same reactions, but in a modern world. So intuitively it doesn't make sense that something like a job interview would kill our appetite, but when you think in terms of evolutionary biology, it makes perfect sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It's a very efficient machine, the body. Also a very stupid one sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is the cortisol our stomach releases when we are in fight or flight mode. It is essentially a burst of sugar to pump up our adrenaline to either run away from danger or fight it off. When you are anxious your body assumes you are in danger and reacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't wait until we get to a point where any statement about anxiety or stress does not start with, &quot;Back in caveman times...&quot; It's such bs. That's not how evolution works. Anxiety is a normal response to a threat, period. Cave-dwellers probably had more anxiety to deal with than just escaping predators. And really, <em>humans</em> are also apex predators. For all we know, early humans were more afraid of social exclusion, injuries/illness, climate/weather events, and failing to procure food and water, which sounds a lot like things modern humans also worry about.</p>
<p>There are a few things going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Digestion falls under the realm of the parasympathetic nervous system. Anxiety response falls under the realm of the sympathetic nervous system. They move in opposition. When one is dominant, i.e. you feel acutely anxious, the other steps back for a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your stomach is your second brain, literally. The enteric nervous system can make your stomach feel weird. This is why people with anxiety disorders or problems tend to also have a lot of digestive problems.</p>
</li>
<li>Some people associate food with comfort, and when they feel anxious, they may use food to self-soothe. So rather than not feeling hungry when they are anxious, they may feel very hungry.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bodies are great, but we don't really have a ton of responses. Psychological anxiety is most closely tied to physical, visceral fear and this triggers the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. In this state, the body is all about conserving energy and using it to survive. Anything you don't need to waste energy on gets shut down.</p>
<p>Digestion takes a lot of energy, but your muscles, liver, and fat tissue all have plenty of energy for you to survive for a while. So we waste less energy on digestion, and that gives you the sensation of not being hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
