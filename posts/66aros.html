		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's dozens of reasons. Many of them have been mentioned, I'll take a shot at the ones that haven't been, or haven't been mentioned in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>North Koreans don't have any marketable skills. East German unemployment is pretty high (compared to 0% under their old system), but most people were able to either keep their old jobs (particularly the working class), or could easily train to be as good at their careers as West Germans (in the case of sciences, history/sociology/anything that has a political bent to it, and so on). North Korea has some fantastic workers. They have doctors who can operate on you using an old beer bottle for an IV, and tools that were made before the Korean War even happened, and have a high chance of success. Their life expectancy is very high for a country roughly at the same economic and technological level as Ghana. But when those doctors enter a South Korean hospital, with state-of-the-art equipment and specialized drugs, nobody's going to need their beer bottle anymore. Those doctors will know next to nothing on how to work in a South Korean hospital, besides maybe a decent understanding of biology and anatomy. More likely, they're going to have to wait tables and sweep floors in that kind of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who knows anything in that country is probably a member of the elite and closely tied to the ruling family. If you get rid of all of them, put them in jail or so on, you'll have a serious case of Problem #1. Also the actual unification will be harder because they'll fight until they've got nothing left to shoot but their fingers, because they have everything to lose and nothing to gain. But if you keep them on to help in the transition, it's going to be a huge political mess, because the last thing the North wants is more of the same - we just sold them on the idea of joining the rich, high-tech South Koreans - and the political blowback from keeping the people who were putting their own people into death camps, running the same group of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting to the unification is going to be a problem. The Kim family won't hold on to power forever, but they can hold on for a very long time. If we try to make peace with them (as we have before), they'll probably take us for a ride again, and then go back to business as usual, their regime a little more stable. But if we try to push them into a war they can't win... the South Korean capital happens to be just a few miles away from tons of North Korean artillery. West Germany couldn't've probably integrated the East by force for the same reason (West Berlin). The people in Seoul aren't going to be happy if their gung-ho leadership ends up getting the whole city shelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whereas in Germany you had the Allied powers wipe the slate and set up the eventual reunification, Korean division was a bit more messy. North Korea used to be home to a lot of landowners, who made sure to take the deeds to the huge estates they owned with them when they escaped to South Korea or Japan. Many of their kids and grandkids still have those deeds locked in a safe somewhere, and since the South technically claims sovereignty over North Korea (they even have official governors of those provinces), there's nothing right now stopping them from marching North and demanding their huge tracts of land back from whatever group of farmers is currently there.</p>
</li>
<li>In East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries, the worst thing that could happen to you is that you could be shot. If life sucks enough, you might be willing to get shot if the alternative is a chance at a better life. Why live on suffering? Eventually, life began to get so bad throughout the communist bloc that tons of people looked at each other, realized life was pretty bad, and started to rebel. If your dad went to jail, you could lay low, but still have some hidden sympathies that would come out when the time is right. In the North, punishment is collective. If your grandpa gets caught listening to the wrong radio station and doesn't have the bribe money (about 4 years' worth of honest wages for that crime) or lives in a politically significant area like the capital, he's going to get sent to a concentration camp, but so will his close family and whoever lives with him, which probably includes you. If it's a serious crime (like escaping to the South), they'll probably follow it through to the letter, which means three generations of your family goes to camp. If the third generation doesn't exist, it'll be born there. Some North Koreans are born and die within the walls of a single concentration camp (look up Escape from Camp 14 for more on this). And if by the clemency of the Great Leader you're released back into your society, your songbun (for all intents and purposes, your caste) will be the lowest, &quot;hostile&quot; tier. So you'll be untouchable and your kids and grandkids will be untouchable, all because your grandpa tried to tune in to a South Korean soap opera. So that kind of pressure makes people very, very hesitant to stray from the system, whereas in East Germany, by the end, everyone was so wary of the government that you seemed suspicious if you were 100% enthusiastic about the ruling party or the socialist system.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Communist East Germany wasn't exactly a worker's paradise, but it wasn't a nightmarish personality cult dictatorship either.</p>
<p>The nation had functioning (but dated) infrastructure, education, and industry in the 80s.  The East Germans had access to enough media to have a good grasp of world events and were modern enough to transition fairly easily back into a free society.</p>
<p>North Korea has none of those things.  The citizens are very poorly educated and have minimal skillsets beyond military service and subsistence farming.  Much of the nation's industry is obsolete and there is very little infrastructure.  Media is heavily state controlled and all news is propaganda.</p>
<p>Modernization of North Korea is a pretty daunting task, they're many decades behind their neighbors and extremely poor.  East Germany wasn't very far behind or unusually poor when reunification occurred</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, reunification between East and West Germany wasn’t a seamless as your title suggests. West German taxpayers have spent over $1.5 trillion to modernize the East since unification and it still lags behind the West in nearly every metric that matters: per capita GDP, household income, poverty, worker productivity, education, etcetera. Even at that though, East Germany was by far the most robust Soviet block economy and things could have been much worse had it not been.
East and West Germany voluntarily reunited and the chance of North Korea voluntarily and peacefully reuniting with the South are non-existent. Similarly, East Germans were well educated, relatively well skilled and still maintained contact with relatives and friends in the West (all be it heavily censored). North Koreans on the other hand are dirt poor and know nothing of the outside world other than what the government tells them.
As hard as East West German reunification was, it would be several generations and cost Trillions to bring North Korea anywhere near to the Souths level of development. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that the 1989 Chinese Student Protests had just happened and the Soviet Union's leadership did not want that to happen in the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1989 there were widespread student protests across China that culminated with a crackdown on the central protests in Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. Hundreds to thousands of students died, soldiers were attacked by mobs of civilians and even some PLA units, including most of the 116th Division, refused to advance on the students.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1989 various Communist bloc nations in Europe were allowing people to leave and go to NATO member states, it became something of a crisis and ultimately lead to the fall of the Inter-German border and the eventual unification of Germany.</p>
<p>There wasn't more violence because in July 1989 the Soviet leadership said that the Soviet Union wouldn't invade a Warsaw Pact ally that was liberalizing. With that assurance Hungary took down it's border walls in August 1989 and the whole thing unraveled by Christmas 1989 when the leaders of Romania were sentenced to death by their own people.</p>
<p>In North Korea there is no discussion about such liberalization because it is an absolute dictatorship in a way that no Communist country has ever had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
