		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, through difference in “impedance”.  The aux port on your stereo probably has an input impedance of about 1000 ohms. Your earbuds are about 20-25 ohms. </p>
<p>The stereo has a high input impedance because it doesn’t need to load down the source because it has its own amplifiers, Your earbuds need all the juice they can get, though</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: Thank you so much for my first ever Reddit gold, stranger. You guys in the comments have all been awesome. &lt;3</p>
<p>Your phone can &quot;feel&quot; how hard it has to push and pull against what's plugged into the aux jack. It moves the speaker in your headphones out with a push of electrons and then it pulls back to pull it in. Do this fast or slow and you have a frequency, and do it in very specific timing and you're vibrating just like someone's vocal cords, or the string on an instrument, or a combination of those.</p>
<p>Aux in your car is different like they said. See, instead of talking directly to a tiny easy to push speaker in headphones your car has really big intimidating speakers and your phone is really apprehensive about a job that big. So instead it talks to a middle manager in the stereo called an amplifier who listens to your phone and they and their friends in the stereo do the job of pushing and pulling themselves, making things really really easy on your phone. There's basically no pushing and pulling happening at all!</p>
<p>Your phone keeps track of how hard it is to push or pull something so it doesn't hurt itself or do something really rude like shout in an amplifier's ear because they're friends and friends don't do that. Nowadays phones are clever enough that they remember how loud that pushing and pulling should be for those two friends instead of forgetting every time it changes. It's important to note that the volume (amplitude) of the pushing and pulling is different than how hard it is to do the work. Think pushing and pulling two boxes the same size the same distance at the same speed, but one box is empty and the other is full of rocks. Someone watching wouldn't know it, but your arms sure feel the difference! The phone's the same way pushing and pulling that signal through the wire.</p>
<p>Hope that helps~</p>
<p>EDIT: Some have clarified that the phone is not measuring impedance and I'm here to say you're absolutely right! Top comment has a somewhat half right answer. If you liked my ELI5 above be ready for something more like an ELI12 below.</p>
<p>So, impedance is the friction, the squeeze, the resistance to a flow of electricity. Specifically when you're pushing and pulling back and forth instead of going one way all the time. You've probably heard something along the lines of batteries are DC and your house is AC at some point in your life. This gets somewhat complicated so we're going to do the subject a disservice by leaving it really simple and saying DC only cares about how much resistance, or friction if we're using a pushing boxes across the floor metaphor, in that circuit or pathway to it's destination. Impedance is more complicated, it's that friction on the floor but it's also invisible things that interfere and slow us down. Radio, magnetic fields, it's hard to really give a good basic explanation that really illustrates what our push and pull signal are going to go through but we'll say some environments are windy in the place you're pushing the box. Sometimes it's at your back, your front, or your side and that can all have an impact on what your pushing and pulling looks like so you need to work hard to make sure that the receiver of your signal sees what you want them to. This extra work, and the work in general, is the load. The load is a measurement of how much power it's taking to do the thing you're trying to do. A really rough road that rubs on your box a lot and high winds and you're working really hard. A really slick road and no wind and you're flying that box across the ground with ease. Now, we don't really have the measuring instruments to say exactly how rough the winds and road are, but we do know how much power we're putting in to work. That's load monitoring. We could probably make a really good guess what the impedance of our environment is now that we know how far and how fast to shift the box around as well as how much power we're putting in to do it but we don't need to. We can continue to leave that variable unknown because all we need are the other two.</p>
<p>For the budding engineers:
We'll assume we're converting our impedance to equivalent resistance because it makes the demonstration easier. Load monitoring is not finding R in V=IR, rather it's monitoring our circuit for I. Now, obviously, we could calculate R since we now monitor and know V and I at any given time but there's really no need to. We don't need to monitor R so long as we have a threshold for I to prevent damage in case of a short. Which we really need to do, because a TRS stereo mini connector shorts the output lines every time it's pulled in or pushed out. That's that really obnoxious <em>crackle, pop!</em> that happens when you pull the jack that goes to your speakers. So now, since we have a bunch of really cool integrated circuits that have started to cost pennies to put in phones we don't just shunt a shorted load. We monitor it and have a couple thresholds, a short condition that tells the phone to cut power to the amp and pause playback because the headphones were removed/inserted, a value range associated with being connected directly to an amp, and a value range associated with being connected to headphones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you plug in headphones, there's always going to be some resistance (technically &quot;impedance&quot;) caused by having to move speakers.  An aux jack doesn't have magnets &amp; speakers in there, it just needs to move a little voltage into another amplifier, so it'd be fairly simple to detect the vastly lower impedance and adjust behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So all of the explanations I have been seeing &quot;difference between <em>impedance&quot;</em>. For the people who doesn't know what this is, imagine connecting a garden hose.</p>
<p>A low <em>impedance</em> would be like a big nozzle to connect to, lots of water gets through, you can use this to water your garden (earphones).</p>
<p>A high <em>impedance</em> would be a really small nozzle, very little water gets through, you only need a bit to rinse your hands. You'll wash your hands properly in a sink later with more water (car amplifier).</p>
<p>That's how I teach the actual kids about it.</p>
