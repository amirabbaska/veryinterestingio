		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody's mentioned this, so I figured I'd give my $0.02. Old man strength is typically from those who have been performing some form of physical labor for a long time, and have such developed incredible grip strength. This is the part that /u/WOT_IF_UR_LEGS is talking about where it feels as if they can crush your hands. Additionally, what they may lack in raw power, they make up for from years of lifting heavy objects and have developed a proficiency in it so that they may look a lot weaker (old man) than they really are (strength).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Young men today actually have weaker grips than men did 30 years ago, and likely in generations prior to that.  Grip strength is often used as a proxy for general body strength in populations.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1985, men ages 20-24 had an average right-handed grip of 121 pounds and left-handed grip of 105 pounds. Today, men that age had grips of only 101 and 99 pounds, the study found. Men 25-29 posted losses of 26 and 19 pounds.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/13/481590997/millennials-may-be-losing-their-grip" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/13/481590997/millennials-may-be-losing-their-grip</a></p>
<p>The truth is that men today are likely weaker than any recent generations of men.  This is probably due to obvious shifts in physical activity for pleasure and for work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old man strength is nothing special you gain with age, it's just when we're surprised by how strong Grandpa still is. After all, he just took five minutes to get out of his chair without his joints exploding, so we definitely didn't expect him to casually break loose the stuck jar lid Junior was struggling with.</p>
<p>Because of their appearance and mannerisms, we think of old people as being frail and weak, but they're often far stronger than they look. It's unlikely an 80-year-old will actually be stronger than a 40-year-old, but the difference in their strength may be smaller than the difference in their appearance. We're occasionally reminded of that and it surprises us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies have actually proven that men tend to peak in physical strength at around 35-40 years old. That’s certainly not “old man” age, but it does show that men get stronger with age</p>
<p>What many people refer to is how older men will absolutely crush your hand during a handshake, and that is mostly due to the fact that they have been practicing handshakes for decades, and are going to be able to have much better technique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>older people, men in particular, are more likely to have engaged in physical labor all of their lives, leaving them with muscles, bones, tendons, joints, and pain tolerances better suited to feats of strength</li>
<li>while coordination and endurance suffer as we age, people often retain much of their raw strength, and it can be unexpected to find a man who has trouble climbing a flight of stairs will has a vice-like grip</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, they are not stronger than they were at the prime, just strong they most people would expect them to be.</p>
<p>My mom worked in nursing homes, and mentally incapacitated older male patients were often a problem.  They weren't necessarily violent, but they often got confused, and if they didn't want to do something, it was often difficult, or even dangerous, to try to make them do something.  They were just as strong as any nurse or orderly, even if they were in a wheelchair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
