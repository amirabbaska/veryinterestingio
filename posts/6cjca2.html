		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all the comments made so far, but I think we're missing one element:</p>
<p>We want our friends to like us for introducing them to it. We want recognition of being cool / cultured / having good taste - whatever.</p>
<p>My favorite author* on child psychology says that the deepest desire, the deepest motivator, for all people is a need to be seen. We want to be seen as valuable and something special, be accepted for who we really are. Sharing what we like is a form of openness and vulnerability, and that makes us even more focused on getting the right feedback, so we get nervous about whether this movie, or show, or music actually made the mark.</p>
<p>That's why I value it greatly when friends share their interests with me, and I make sure they are seen when they share.</p>
<p>Wow! Thanks for the Gold!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be guilty of showing things to my friends and expecting a certain reaction out of them, and it took me such a long time to finally realize why it doesn't work. Basically, it just creates a certain 'all-or-nothing' pressure that feels gross both to impose on someone else and for that person to notice is being thrust on them. Even just saying &quot;Hey I did watch this already but I'd love to rewatch it with you!&quot; subtly turns people off since they're worried you're focusing more on their reaction than discovering something together. </p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake to make - I always get a vicarious rush when someone I know discovers for the first time a long-time favorite of mine (that actually pretty much sums up nerd-dom in general). But what I've realized is that you need to either wait for them to discover it on their own, or very casually ease them into it while accepting that despite them being on the same wavelength as you in general, they might end up hating it - and that's totally okay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have that problem where my gf and I will be totally looking forward to a show but if I happen to watch an episode before her she will lose all interest in the entire series no matter what.  It basically has to be her idea and on her own terms and we must watch everything together.  She seemed totally down with the previews of Westworld but the second she found out I watched the first episode on my own she basically blacklisted it for herself.  Hasn't watched the series to this day.  Meanwhile she has no problem powering though a 22 episode season of some other random show in a week and asking me why I haven't given it a chance or why I won't rewatch it with her.  Some people just need to feel like they're the entertainers I think.  </p>
<p>Also as others have said before some of it may come from constantly worrying what your friend is thinking.  The best way to ensure your friend doesn't enjoy what you're showing them is to constantly pause the show/movie and try to get them to validate how kewl it is.  It's very awkward for them and a guaranteed way to ensure they never wanna watch anything you suggest to them again.</p>
<p>Edit: I suppose I'll add that it is indeed a dick move on my part to watch something without her that we planned on watching together.  That being said she will occasionally do the same thing.  Like I suggested she rewatch season one of Master of None so we could start season two.  She admitted to me after two days that she got so hooked she binged watched straight through season two one night while I was asleep.  I just laughed cause it didn't really bother me.  She is a binge watch pro and can burn through shows way faster than I can.  I came clean and admitted I started season five of the Americans without her and she didn't mind.  Sometimes we just aren't on the same wavelength with shows I guess.  We usually understand, but as I said above earlier she has a really difficult time getting into something I've started without her.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's cause when you watch a show, it usually takes a bit for the cast to mesh together and for them to hit a good stride for the humor. So by the time you're usually in the position where you feel this show is so great that you want to share it with people, you usually have watched a bunch of episodes already. </p>
<p>But when you typically show it to your friends, you start on the first episode, which may not be that super amazing as the later episodes are, especially once you know the characters and their idiosyncrasies yet. </p>
<p>Just recently this happened to me with Stranger Things. My roommate raved about it, and wanted me to watch it. I watched the first episode and was meh, but he insisted I watch a few more. I did, and enjoyed them. But he made his recommendation to me by the time he already saw 4 of the episodes, so his perception was a bit different. </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agree with most of these comments, but some fail (in my opinion) to pinpoint exactly where the &quot;weird, awkward&quot; feeling comes from. I have 2 possible culprits for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extra knowledge. When watching a series for a second time, you usually notice things that play a part later. Things you didn't notice before. This can make a series more enjoyable to watch again, but also makes you a lot more enthusiastic while watching it with the newly introduced friend. Imagine me pointing at a really small, tiny detail and saying &quot;That is so awesome&quot;, simply because it matters a lot later. kinda makes it weird.</p>
</li>
<li>And this is the big one. When watching a series that you really want someone to like, it's kinda like preparing for a date. You want it to be awesome, you want it to be perfect. Thus you notice the small problems so much more. Due to your own fear of the other person not liking the series, you instinctively notice more bad parts and end up trying to defend it, rather then enjoying the movie. Your friend will likely not even notice these small things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, our brains are kinda weirdly wired when it comes to introducing things to others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
