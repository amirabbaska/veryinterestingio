		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that diffraction becomes a limiting factor with smaller apertures.  I believe a &quot;photon sized&quot; (aka wavelength sized?) pinhole with an ambient brightness source would result in a diffraction pattern of concentric rings with no capability to resolve any detail. </p>
<p>The diffraction limit describes the absolute maximum angular resolution for optics. To resolve very fine details, you need a large aperture. This is one reason why telescopes and huge and why SLR camera will always have better image quality than mobile phones given the same technology in each. </p>

<p>As the aperture approaches zero, the angular resolution approaches infinity, meaning you can't resolve the details of anything, no matter how large it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends on your pinhole size and light intensity. If you have a pulsed laser directly incident on the pinhole stopped down so only &lt;&lt;1 photon passes through the aperture per pulse, you'll form the appropriate diffraction pattern on the other side - that is, a single photon can interfere with itself to form a diffraction pattern. This is reminiscent of Youngs double slit with a single photon experiment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question you're asking is more like &quot;how do we visually represent the information from one photon?&quot;</p>
<p>So given the relevant visual properties; wavelength and luminosity - electronically you'll end up with a pixel in a colorspace defined by your recording software and display method (often rgba - red green blue alpha)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're using typical silver halide photographic film, you may not get any exposure at all due to the grain activation threshold.</p>
<p>To be exposed, each silver halide grain actually needs to be hit by two to four photons (within some relaxation time). If the aperture is set to only let in single photons infrequently, none of the grains will be exposed.</p>
<p>In general, film (and CCD sensors) have all sort of what are called reciprocity failures--where development isn't proportional to photon intensity--at very high and low exposure times and very high and low illuminances.</p>
<p>The question is still interesting for an ideal sensor--but I'd do some research before making this camera experimentally--you might be disappointed after waiting for a very long exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ignore diffraction, and have what is know as the ray approximation where light only travels in straight lines, everything would be in perfect focus. This is partly why old cameras needed so much light. If you take into account diffraction however such a small hole would result in concentric rainbow rings assuming the hole was about wavelength sized, there would be practically no spacial information left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
