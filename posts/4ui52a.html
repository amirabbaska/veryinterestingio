		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a fire investigator for 6 years. We go about finding what started a fire by A) looking at burn patterns and B) interviewing the people that were there if possible. </p>
<p>If the whole house has not burned down, I look for the that has the most burn damage. In a urban area where the fire department is pretty responsive, you may only get smoke damage in most of the house. This rules out the rest of the house from starting the fire. Let's say the most burnt area is near the kitchen. You start asking yourself what can start a fire in that area. Usually this would be your stove, electrical systems, candles etc.  The next thing you would do is rule out each possible source of fire by looking at witness marks. These are distinct marks where the flames appeared to originate.  Eventually you will get to a point where you can conclusively rule out what definitely did not cause the fire and hopefully left with one source of the fire.  </p>
<p>It is not uncommon to sift through an entire room of debris to find common sources of ignition.  When sifting, we have found cigarette butts, arced wires, matches, and one time an 85 year old woman's stash of condoms.  If we believe arson was a possibility, we will take samples of the area for chemical analysis.  Arson is pretty obvious as it leaves what is called a ghosting pattern on the floor.  We can pull samples from the edges of the burn and test for gasoline etc. When it comes down to it, all fires need fuel, oxygen and a source of ignition.  This is called the fire triangle.  Our job is to look for the source of ignition. </p>
<p>For those asking about forest fires, I was not in that type of work but I assume the same way.  I am sure they use an areal view of the area to determine the starting point and go from there.  </p>
<p>Edit*  I wrote this when I woke up without my contacts in so sorry for the grammatical errors.  Also adding some more details.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Determination of a fire normally starts by examining the area of the least damage and working your way in towards the area of the most damage. This entire time you are examining all aspects of the area, what has been burned and what has not been burned. You will look at the burn patterns and you should be documenting your findings. Taking photographs of the scene, videos, recording spoken observations, or handwritten notes can all be used.</p>
<p>Your goal here is to work and find the area or area<strong>s</strong> of fire origin. Where did the fire start. You may be able to determine the exact location (i.e. the burn patterns indicate that it started at the electrical outlet) or it may be that your area of origin was the building that was on fire (i.e. there was so much damage we can only say for certain that the fire originated in the house). </p>
<p>Finding the area of most damage does not necessarily indicate the origin (which is the bad science some other posters comment about) but indicates that there was fuel for the fire in the location that burned for a long time. You must use a number of other techniques to make that determination.</p>
<p>After and during your walk through and coming up with your area of origin you will begin going through a series of eliminations. Can we rule out -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Causes</strong> - weather, earthquakes, lighting</li>
<li><strong>Electric</strong> - wiring, batteries</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical</strong> - friction generating devices</li>
<li><strong>Heating</strong> - the heating system, blow dryer exhaust, electric heaters</li>
<li><strong>Open Flames</strong> - candles, lighters the burners on a gas range</li>
<li><strong>Spontaneous</strong> - oily rags, linseed oil</li>
<li><strong>Accidental Discard</strong> - cigarettes, cigars</li>
<li><strong>Explosions</strong> - bombs</li>
<li><strong>Intentional Human Involvement</strong> - someone starting the fire</li>
</ul>
<p>Your investigation will also involve interviewing witnesses. You will want to find out what everyone was doing, where they were, what they know. As with anything with people, they may not remember things clearly, they may omit information, recall things incorrectly or even just flat out lie. You must try to get the best information from those your interview to try and get a complete picture of what happened.</p>
<p>Combining the information gained through the interviews with your physical investigation will allow you to make a determination as to what caused the fire. If through the investigation you are unable to eliminate multiple causes (i.e. I can not rule out electrical causes or accidental discard) then you are left with an undetermined fire. Otherwise you can make a determination as to the origin and cause of the fire.</p>
<p>I think it is important to mention that the fire investigators job is to determine the <strong>Origin and Cause</strong> of the fire. It is should not be with the goal of proving arson. As an investigator you should always be objectively providing the facts of the case, not trying to prove a point.</p>
<p>And finally you will most likely not be finding the cigarette stub when everything is burned out. You may find a number of cigarette butts near the area of origin, or an ash tray, your interviews will let you know that the resident discarded a cigarette in the area of origin between 30 and 50 minutes prior to the fire starting, and that you can eliminate all other causes of ignition. Based on the information available at this time you can make a determination of accidental discard.</p>
<p>In the United States there are two main standards that fire investigators are held to <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards?mode=code&amp;code=1033" target="_blank">NFPA 1033</a> which outline the professional qualifications that an investigator must have and <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards?mode=code&amp;code=921" target="_blank">NFPA 921</a> which is the way that fire investigations should be performed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CAUTION!:  The &quot;science&quot; of fire investigation over the last 50 years <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/long_held_beliefs_about_arson_science_have_been_debunked_after_decades_of_m" target="_blank">has come under serious attack</a> and is not reliable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For decades, fire investigators relied on a set of erroneous beliefs and assumptions, akin to folklore, about what were thought to be the telltale signs of arson that were passed down from one generation to the next and accepted at face value.</p>
<p>At the time, the investigation of fires was viewed more as an art than a science, a mix born of experience and intuition. Fire debris was read like tea leaves. And investigators routinely interpreted the artifacts of a fire—burn patterns, charred wood, melted metal, collapsed furniture springs, spalled (chipped or scaled) concrete and crazed glass—as surefire indicators of arson.</p>
<p>Some of those myths were based on what seemed like intuitively “obvious” deductions, such as the notion that gas burns hotter than wood. Others were the result of unwarranted generalizations, like observing a pattern of spalling around the remains of a gasoline container and making an erroneous association between spalling and gasoline. But none of those so-called arson indicators was grounded in science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that lots of people have been wrongly convicted and imprisoned, and possibly executed, based on these faulty techniques. </p>
<p>Arson investigations <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/how-arson-investigation-has-changed/" target="_blank">may improve in the future</a>.  But for now you should be highly skeptical of the accuracy of any of the old techniques.  Fire investigation science <a href="http://citylimits.org/2014/05/14/arson-investigation-techniques-catching-up-with-science/" target="_blank">has a long way to go</a> still. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We learned a little about this at the Fire Academy, but obviously I was never a real investigator.</p>
<p>One thing that happens is that the more stuff that is on fire, the hotter it gets, which means the longer the fire is going the more fully and quickly stuff burns. So you can use that to start to trace back the fire to where it started (incompletely burned stuff, more smoke residue because stuff wasn't burning all the way, etc).</p>
<p>Also, smoke patterns can be very telling, because they are an indication of an &quot;impure&quot; burn, which means things are not hot enough to burn all the way.  So, smoke residue on one part of the house, but none elsewhere means you may have found the origin room, and further sleuthing will tell you more.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you find no slow start to the burn, then it may mean that accelerants were involved, which may point to arson.</p>
<p>There's obviously a lot more to it, but there's a couple of real examples that we learned many years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
