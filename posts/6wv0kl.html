		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, infinitely many. Consider for example a man that lived, say 30,000 years ago that had some recessive genetic disorder. He could pass this gene on for 1000 generations, and assuming no one else in the tree carried that gene, none of his descendents would developed this disease. Until after 1000 generations, a distant descendent of his has a child with a woman that also carries this gene and their child has a genetic disease. </p>
<p>There is no length of time where genetics or medical history becomes irrelevant. That said, the further back it goes the less influence it has. First of course, because with more generations you have more ancestors, and it is less likely you would have inherited a gene from any one ancestor. And second, because it becomes increasingly unlikely that a disease that was present in your family 30,000 years ago would not have been present in any of the 1000 generations before you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Practically, we only really care about two generations (so back to your grandparents). It all depends on the particulars of the situation, though. Generally, if your great-grandparents' health issues didn't affect your parents, aunts/uncles, or grandparents, they're pretty unlikely to affect you.</p>
<p>But, if they <em>did</em> affect someone else, it can be a little significant. I had a patient recently whose mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother all got endometrial cancer in their 40s or 50s. Knowing there were three consecutive generations of cancer made the case for a hereditary cancer syndrome even stronger (Lynch syndrome). It didn't really change our management at all, but it made us even more certain. </p>
<p>You can probably come up with some contrived scenarios with recessive disorders or in-breeding where maybe you'd care if it was just the great-grandparents, but those are pretty rare. If it's just that your great-grandparents had diabetes or heart disease, we don't really care about that at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine that anything more than 3-4 generations would be beneficial. Not because you wouldn't benefit from information about your great-great-great grandfather's heart attack, but simply because a diagnosis from the early 1900s would likely be incorrect or only vaguely correct. Pre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Osler" target="_blank">William Osler</a>, there wasn't even the prevailing mindset of taking patient history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to sound like an overtly religious person, but in ancient India, people realised that certain diseases arise more commonly out of marriages within a family. They studied this concept mathematically, and realised that the probability of a couple having a child with a genetic defect approaches to extremely small levels by seven generations. So they theorised that seven generations of separation is what it takes to prevent certain genetic diseases which ran in families. So they came up with the system of a 'gotra' that still persists in Hindu society - where you are separated from others by at least seven generations, and put people in certain 'gotras' or 'clans' - with the belief that you must not marry within your gotra. It proved quite successful at decreasing the incidence of recessive disorders, but was not perfect - as your gotra was only determined by your patrilineal descent and not matrilineal.</p>
<p>The problem now is that these gotras aren't updated with every generation, so people even within the same gotra are often separated by MUCH MUCH more than seven generations, and because of social religious norms, struggle to marry even if they want to. This has led to some people working for the abolition of the gotra system from society, although legally in India you can marry anyone (of the opposite gender).</p>
<p>Hope this helped! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
