		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m hearing that Japan is in danger a lot more serious than Chernobyl, it is expanding, getting worse, and that the government is silencing the truth about these and blinding the world and even their own people due to political and economical reasonings. Am I to believe that the government is really pushing campaigns for Fukushima to encourage other Japanese residents and the world to consume Fukushima products?  </p>
<p>However, I’m also hearing that these are all just conspiracy theory and since it’s already been 7 years since the incident, as long as people don’t travel within the gates of nuclear plants, there isn’t much inherent danger and threat against the tourists and even the residents. Am I to believe that there is no more radiation flowing or expanding and that less than 0.0001% of the world population is in minor danger?  </p>
<p>Are there any Anthropologist, Radiologist, Nutritionist, Geologist, or Environmentalists alike who does not live in or near Japan who can confirm the negative effects of the radiation expansion of Japan and its product distribution around the world?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 2 events have been compared, of course. I refer you to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fcav.unesp.br/Home/departamentos/morfologia/ELISABETHCRISCUOLOURBINATI/materialdidatico/07-comparison-of-the-chernobyl-and-fukushima-nuclear-accidents-2014.pdf" target="_blank">Steinhauser, G., Brandl, A., &amp; Johnson, T. E. (2014). Comparison of the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents: a review of the environmental impacts. Science of the Total Environment, 470, 800-817.</a></p>
<p>which have the following to say: &quot;<em>In almost every respect, the consequences of the Chernobyl accident clearly exceeded those of the Fukushima accident.   ... the amount of refractory elements (including actinides) emitted in the course of the Chernobyl accident was approximately four orders of magnitude higher than during the Fukushima accident. ...  In the course of the Fukushima accident, the majority of the radionuclides (more than 80%) was transported offshore and deposited in the Pacific Ocean. Monitoring campaigns after both accidents reveal that the environmental impact of the Chernobyl accident was much greater than of the Fukushima accident. Both the highly contaminated areas and the evacuated areas are smaller around Fukushima and the projected health effects in Japan are significantly lower than after the Chernobyl accident.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>That being said, in the specific case of Fukushima, a large part of the radioactive emissions were carried out to the Pacific, away from inhabited territory. In the ocean, mixing and turbulence have been strong factors in diluting the contaminants to levels where they pose no threat to the food supply. In particular, see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2013/05/30/1221834110.full.pdf" target="_blank">Fisher, N. S., Beaugelin-Seiller, K., Hinton, T. G., Baumann, Z., Madigan, D. J., &amp; Garnier-Laplace, J. (2013). Evaluation of radiation doses and associated risk from the Fukushima nuclear accident to marine biota and human consumers of seafood. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(26), 10670-10675.</a> whose frank and clear conclusion deserves to be quoted at length:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>This study shows that the committed effective dose received by humans based on a year’s average consumption of contaminated PBFT (pacific blue fin tuna) from the Fukushima accident is comparable to, or less than, the dose we routinely obtain from naturally occurring radionuclides in many food items, medical treatments, air travel, or other background sources. Although uncertainties remain regarding the effects of low levels of ionizing radiation on humans, it is clear that doses and resulting cancer risks associated with consumption of PBFT in eastern and western Pacific waters are low and below levels that should cause concern to even the most exposed segments of human populations. Fears regarding environmental radioactivity, often a legacy of Cold War activities and distrust of governmental and scientific authorities, have resulted in perception of risks by the public that are not commensurate with actual risks</em>&quot;</p>
<p>I guess that one thing you have to keep in mind is that as radioactive elements disperse away from their source, they also dilute themselves until they hopefully reach concentrations which have an insignificant incidence on human health. In the case of Fukushima, this was reached sooner than in Chernobyl because the amount of radioactive elements produced was far less, and because much of it was deposited in that greatest of all dilution patches: the Pacific Ocean. It is also worth noting that these radionuclides will progressively <del>eliminate themselves though fission</del> reach stability through decay (EDIT: thanks to /u/Rishfee for the correction), thus bringing their concentrations even further down.</p>
<p>You also bring up the question of the suitability of agricultural products. This was looked into by <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es5057648" target="_blank">Merz, S., Shozugawa, K., &amp; Steinhauser, G. (2015). Analysis of Japanese radionuclide monitoring data of food before and after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Environmental science &amp; technology, 49(5), 2875-2885.</a> They noted that maximum concentrations of radioactive caesium peaked successively, first in vegetables, then in mushrooms, followed by beef and boar. Maximum concentrations were reached within a few months of the accident, and then decreased rapidly.</p>
<p>To put things into perspective, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" target="_blank">the initial megathrust earthquake (9.0–9.1 (Mw)) and resulting tsunami</a> were far more damaging. Those were thoroughly brutal and caused 15,896 deaths, 6,157 injured, and 2,537 people missing and an estimated economic cost of US$235 billion. Not that the area needed a nuclear disaster on top of things ...</p>
<p>EDIT: thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I interviewed a man with a PhD in engineering from Waterloo, and also worked at NASA. During the meltdown, he was measuring levels of atmospheric pollution, mainly CO2 and Methane, but he also looked at the level of radiation released. He said that the level of atmospheric radiation peaked the day after the meltdown, and rapidly decreased for the next 10 days until it was indistinguishable from the background. If the peak atmospheric radiation had stayed the same for those 10 days, he said you would be exposed to less radiation than eating 1 extra banana.
Due to the radiation there were 0 deaths, and only 2 people exceeded the radiation exposure limit. <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/31/japan-nuclear-plant-explosion" target="_blank">https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/31/japan-nuclear-plant-explosion</a>
The only deaths that he was aware of were from the evacuations and the massive oil spill (that also affected the nuclear plant).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real question to ask about this event is: why did it happen? The Japanese are well aware of the hazards of tsunamis and earthquakes. They have some of the best engineering in the world because of this awareness.</p>
<p>Answer: tsunami that reached further inland than the Japanese written record. Thus, a nuclear plant was built in what was deemed a “safe” area.</p>
<p>How did that happen? Well, human record is a very short timeframe compared to geologic time. No one bothered to listen to the team of geologists who, only a few years before the tsunami, were waving their arms in panic when they found a geologic record of tsunami reaching even further inland /many times over/ but on a timescale that preceded written record.</p>
<p>It saddens me every time i think of this event, to remember that the /entire situation could have been avoided/. They were warned. But no one listened to the science. It’s such a shame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Does not stricly answer your question, as that was targetet at <em>negative</em> effects, but may be informative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: Despite the many studies that have shown minimal health risks to individuals living outside of Japan following the Fukushima Nuclear Accident, there are persisting concerns regarding the consumption of Pacific seafood that may be contaminated with radioactive species from Fukushima. To address these concerns, the activity concentrations of anthropogenic 134Cs and 137Cs, as well as naturally occurring 40K, were measured in Pacific salmon collected from Kilby Provincial Park, British Columbia (BC), in 2013 and from the Quesnel River, BC, in 2014 using low-background gamma-ray spectroscopy. In addition, soil samples and a single roof-debris sample were collected and analysed to provide a record of Fukushima-derived contamination in BC. Cesium-134 was not detected in the salmon samples. Cesium-137 was not detected in any of the sockeye or chum samples, although it was detected in all of the Chinook samples. The weighted average (±1σ) 137Cs activity concentration in the Chinook salmon collected in 2013 and 2014 was 0.23 (3) and 0.20 (3) Bq/kg fresh weight, respectively. A conservative annual dose estimate for an adult who consumes the average Canadian quantity of seafood per year, contaminated with radiocesium at the maximum concentrations measured in this campaign, was calculated to be 0.054 μSv per year. Cesium-134 was detected in all but two of the soil samples. A weak positive correlation was observed between presence of 134Cs and of 7Be suggesting that the 134Cs arrived via atmospheric deposition. Cesium-137 was present in every soil sample, although the total radiocesium activity concentrations measured were significantly less than action levels set by Health Canada.</p>
