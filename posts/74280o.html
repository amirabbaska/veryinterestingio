		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rain water and waste water can contain harmful chemicals if you drink it directly. Soil can filter some of those chemicals by adsorption, later on plants can filter even more.</p>
<p>But, not all soils and plants have the same filtering properties. For example, some plants can absorb heavy metals and arrest them in nodules in their roots, you wouldn't want to eat that plant.</p>
<p>In general, unless you're close to a contaminated area, the filtering provided by the soil and the plant is enough, meaning the plant is safe to eat. That is without considering the chemical and physical defenses plants make to fend off herbivores.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My husband works for a waste water treatment plant that sends reclaimed water to near by dairy's and vineyards the state (I think, maybe the city) has set standards for how this water can be used in agriculture based on how many dyes removed from the end product the water is used. Example: the water can be used to irrigated crops that the cows eat, that then get slaughtered for market because it's enough steps away from human consumption but they cannot use the water for the cows to drink. Also it can be used to water the vineyards because the grapes go through a fermentation process before consumption so that gets counted as an extra step. It's all very regulated for water that under analysis would be as clean as your tap water if it was chlorinated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely not always true!</p>
<p>Plants can <em>and do</em> absorb toxins from their environment. Now, the plant may filter some (or even all) of them out, but it might not. Some might end up in the parts of the plant you eat - <strong>especially</strong> if you eat the roots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
