But depression can last ones whole life.  </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the premise of the question is legitimate, but maybe just not posed in the most fitting manner, such as the ends of the emotional spectrum being exaggerated for point making but resulted in a loss of relativity. </p>
<p>Simplified, the question would read, &quot;Why does human memory tend to recall or focus on negative emotions over positive ones?&quot; This is not only a legitimate question, but an accurate assessment. </p>
<p>We are negative beings, by nature. Humans are fundamentally equipped with adaptation traits. This means constantly looking (even subconsciously) for ways to improve; never being truly and completely content. We always instinctively want to have more, go further, be better. In this, our brain finds ways to improve, which requires realizing and focusing on &quot;shortfalls&quot;. That carries over to emotion. Negative events or circumstances tend to be recognized earlier and more vividly; they stand out for evaluation, often times getting cataloged as a warning, then we adapt our emotional behavior. When positive things happen, we accept them, but rarely do our minds flare up in a &quot;from now on let's do THAT&quot; sense. Positives do not excite our animalistic instincts. They do not cause our evolutionary core to pay attention to them. So, our brains will forever put a highlight on each bad experience, and it will remain more significant in our subconscious than many successes throughout our lives, affecting our emotions, moods, mental states, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Positive emotions aren't necessarily necessary to survival. It takes time and practice to linger on the positives. </p>
<p>We're just hard wired that way in order for human beings to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mania is the psychiatric opposite to depression, it both can last for a long time <em>and</em> cause massive havoc in people's lives even faster than most depression would. Where depressed people get stuck in the thoughts about negative consequences, manic people don't see consequences at all. If it's fun, it's done. (strongly simplified, it varies a lot) </p>
<p>Shopping sprees are very common. No regard for how much debt is amassed. Often people in mania aren't suspicious either, they happily give things away to anyone, or try the weirdest suggestions without any regard for their safety. </p>
<p>During a mania things are awesome, but like depressive episodes, they don't last for ever, and coming back to the smoking ruins of one's life is harsh.</p>
<p>That full throttle, unaware mania is relatively rare. Way more commonly people are aware that something is weird, but they have a hard time controlling themselves. Fighting to control urges to do things that will ultimately hurt someone is as hard as trying to get things done when the brain just doesn't want to cooperate at all. You know well what you <em>should</em> do, but the brain just won't let you.</p>
<p>That happy emotions don't last is a security measure, shared between many animals, not just humans. </p>
<p>The &quot;happy&quot; is just long enough to register as such, and then it's gone, motivating the critter to go and look for another thing that will cause the sensation.</p>
<p>If it lasted longer, life wouldn't work out very well. If the bliss lasted for ever, people would eat one bite of cake and then starve because there's no urge to repeat the experience. Critters would be easy prey if sex left them high for hours. </p>
<p>Positive emotions create strong motivation. The memory of that tree with the delicious fruit last year will be a strong enough lure, to search for it again this year, see if the pleasant experience can be repeated. </p>
<p>Negative emotions better be stronger and even more memorable because bad things can get critters killed. Better be <em>too</em> afraid of the world, than not enough. Missing out a crop of fruit, oh well, happens, there's other food. Missing the snake on the trail can be a mistake you only make once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most well known is bipolar disorder or 'manic depression', but there are others which don't have the depressive phases.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely misleading, there are hypermanic people that live in a near constant state of euphoria, shit that's what mania is. The premise of your question is just wrong.   </p>
