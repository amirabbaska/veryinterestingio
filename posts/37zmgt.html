		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here!</p>
<p>There are two factors here: the soil capability to drain water to the underwater springs and ants traits.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>On soil percolation.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine the soil as a porous material, when rain starts to fall, soil will absorb some of the water -like a sponge, at a certain rate, this is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation" target="_blank">percolation</a>. Different types of soil have different drainage rates, have you ever seen how fast water drains from sandy beaches? And, on the other side, water takes so long to drain from muddy soils? Here's a video showing <a href="https://youtu.be/h3s_LNla_aI" target="_blank">how to test percolation in different soils</a>, you can even do it yourself!</p>
<p>When soil is dry, it will absorb water, just like when you put the tip of a towel near some water and it starts absorbing everything, it even feels like it is pulling the water! This is exactly what is happening on the soil!</p>
<p>Regardless of soil characteristics, drainage is usually slow. So, underground, it isn't actually &quot;flooding&quot;, the water is slowly moving from aboveground to the aquifers at the bottom. When the soil isn't saturated of water, <em>i.e.</em> can hold more water, it is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadose_zone" target="_blank">vadose zone</a>.</p>
<p>During a flood soils aren't completely saturated with water. They are having a hard time moving water underground (the water income rate is greater that the water outcome rate).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>On ants traits.</strong></p>
<p>Ants are very very small, so small they can actually walk on the water. The force they are stressing on the water surface can't break the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension" target="_blank">surface tension</a> of water.</p>
<p>Evolution sometimes is stunning. Here's a video showing how <a href="https://youtu.be/A042J0IDQK4" target="_blank">fire ants can create an alive raft</a> to move during a sever flood. How they know this, I have not the slightest idea. It's still exciting! There's more to know about nature than we can imagine!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The impact of heavy rain is not as severe as you may think on ant hills. Ants tunnel farther into the soil than what it may appear. It is common, depending on the species of ant, for them to be tunneling at least a foot into the ground.</p>
<p>The penetration of rain into the soil depends on a variety of complex factors, such as how much rain was received, the soil type and how dry the soil is. The ants can tolerate the rain passing through their nest. Fortunately for them, it is unlikely to pool below the soil surface because water generally moves through the soil until it reaches the groundwater. However, if a site is kept excessively moist, the ants likely would die and the colony would not survive.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't ants survive underwater for like three days or something?</p>
<p>someone on ask.com says this &quot;Ants live in nearly every terrestrial habitat on Earth. In some cases, an ant's habitat is subject to flooding or the ant needs to cross a body of water during foraging. Ants, like many insects, breathe through specialized openings in the abdomen. An ant can close these spiracles during submergence in water and can also lower necessary bodily functions, entering a torpor-like state. In this state, the ant requires 20 times less oxygen than it needs while sleeping. The lower the water temperature, the easier it is for the ant to maintain this lower metabolism and the longer it survives below water.</p>
<p>In some cases, ants allow an air bubble to form around their abdomen, enabling them to obtain oxygen while under water for a short period of time. One species of Australian ant, Polyrhachis sokolova, lives in a nest in mangrove mud. These nests flood frequently, for up to 3.5 hours at a time. To cope with the flooding, the Polyrhachis build air pockets into their nests, allowing the ants to remain in the nest until the water subsides.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very good question. However, it can simply be answered by saying that they use properties of fluid dynamics to help themselves stay perfect. This is also what prairie dogs do but they do it on a larger scale.</p>
<p>First, they have that giant mound. Now this may seem weird but it moves away rain that is not directly falling on them. The mound is compacted to help stop collapsing and this is an important thing in itself but we will go into that later. </p>
<p>Second, they create temporary flood rooms. These are what many plumbers call traps. The tunnels bend in such a way (usually in some form of a sideways yet vertical S) that water goes down to collect at the bottom area while the ants are relatively safe at a higher point. These rooms are not meant to store water for a very long time but for long enough of a time that the water has enough time to absorb into the ground and away from their nest. They tend to only show up near the exits because of the higher chance to stop more water there.</p>
<p>Third, as partially mentioned above, the tunnels are compacted. This messes with the absorbance of the water through the soil and that means water does not even have to come in contact with the inside of the tunnels much. This compact dirt seems fairly weak but when it is added with the shape, water can flow around and not collapse the tunnel. It can even support molten metal flowing through the nest so it is fairly strong against much worse forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
