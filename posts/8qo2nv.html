<p>Drugs used to come in bulk, in big bottles and cases and then the pharmacist would take part of that and give you the drugs you wanted in a paper bag, wooden case or glass bottle. It wasn't like today where everything is all neat and tidy in their own little box and single packaging pill sheets. So you had to get everything dosed out manually by the pharmacist who worked behind the counter. </p>
<p>As others have said, prescriptions came later along with regulations. I just wanted to add a post for the image so you could visualize what it would be like to shop at one of these pharmacies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Idk if it is very different depending on what country you are in, but at least in Australia you can only get OTC medications from a pharmacy, and some require for you to see a dispensery assistant or a pharmacist, whereas prescription medication can only be acquired with a prescription. Other medications such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, immodium, etc. Aren't marketed at OTC and can be purchased at local grocery shops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the country. In the UK, there are 3 classifications of medication:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prescription Only Medication</li>
<li>Pharmacy Medicines</li>
<li>General Sales List</li>
</ol>
<p>The first is obvious, I guess. The second is 'over the counter' medication. The third is stuff that is put on the shelves, and can be sold anywhere (supermarkets, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prior to the implementation of the Durham-Humphrey Amendment, all drugs were counted and dispensed in a pharmacy from bulk containers and patients were handed counted doses &quot;over-the-counter&quot; given by the pharmacist, depending on what symptoms they came in with. The only drugs that required a doctor's prescription at this time were ones that contained sulfanilamide.</p>
<p>When this amendment came into place, it placed a clear distinction between over-the-counter (OTC) medications and prescription (legend) drugs. OTC medications can be obtained without a prescription, while legend drugs require a prescription, as they are medications that have been chosen by the FDA to require supervision from a qualified health practitioner. These drugs have some habit-forming tendencies or are potentially harmful in some way. Prescription drugs also all carry the label &quot;Caution: Federal Law prohibits dispensing without prescription.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
