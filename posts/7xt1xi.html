The article discusses some results that suggest &quot;..showing [anti-vaxxers] photos of vaccine preventable diseases, and the personal account of a woman whose 10-month-old son almost died from measles&quot; was the most effective approach at positively shifting opinions on vaccines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like the mom's primary concerns are adjuvants, which are the chemicals added to vaccines to help the immune system recognize the other components as something that is &quot;dangerous&quot; and should be targeted. It's going to be difficult to find studies that cover the safety of ALL vaccines and adjuvants, simply because that's a huge topic to cover. [This is a peer-reviewed meta-analysis of some recent vaccine trials] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740250" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740250</a>) Those may not be the exact vaccines or adjuvants that the mom is concerned about, but it's a really good example of how careful and complete the research is into the safety of these vaccines. If you find out more details about what specific vaccines or chemicals she objects to, you can go to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank">Pubmed</a> and enter search terms - I would suggest [name of disease or name of chemical] + [&quot;adjuvant&quot; or &quot;vaccine&quot;] + &quot;safety&quot;. If that brings up too many results, add &quot;meta analysis&quot;. </p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that while peer-reviewed articles are great, they are unfortunately not easy to understand for someone without a biology/medicine background (not impossible, but it would take a considerable amount of additional work to look up individual words and terms that she is probably unfamiliar with - and if she's already biased against it, she isn't likely to put in that effort). </p>
<p>So, I would add, in addition to the requested peer-reviewed articles, I think a more effective tactic would be to get at the root of why she is reluctant to vaccinate. [This article] (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/12/5/16733744/vaccines-parents-anti-vax" target="_blank">https://www.vox.com/2017/12/5/16733744/vaccines-parents-anti-vax</a>) discusses the values most commonly held by &quot;vaccine-hesitant&quot; parents, and how to frame your argument to speak to those values, which I think is really useful. </p>
<p>Another important topic to discuss is &quot;the dose makes the poison&quot;. The examples I like to use are: water is toxic in high enough doses, and apples contain formaldehyde. Those are both good examples of how (a) anything can be toxic in high enough doses, so the mere fact that a toxic dose exists means literally nothing about its safety; and conversely, nearly everything toxic does have a safe dose. </p>
<p>Good luck! Sorry for the long-winded post. I'm getting my PhD in microbiology, and I get a little over-excited when it comes to arguing with anti-vaxxers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
