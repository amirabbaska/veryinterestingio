<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/speakerToHeathens" target="_blank">u/speakerToHeathens</a> is correct that with equal pressure inside and outside your body you would have no difficulty breathing.  </p>
<p>As far as poisoning goes, while you wouldn't be underwater, using SCUBA dive tables are still very applicable.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mide.com/pages/air-pressure-at-altitude-calculator" target="_blank">Using this calculator</a> The pressure at -5000' is less than 1.2 atmospheres. (or 20% more than at sea level)  <a href="http://www.calctool.org/CALC/other/games/depth_press" target="_blank">&amp; using this calculator</a> we see that 1.2 atm is equivalent to about 6.5' under water.  When you compare this to <a href="http://www.scubadiverinfo.com/2_divetables.html" target="_blank">standard scuba diver tables</a> you see that they do not even start until 35-40 ft.  This is because diving at such shallow depths has no real effect and so you can stay there indefinitely.</p>
<p>Now lets say your valley was -33,000 ft. below sea level. (equivalent to 64 ft. under water)   At that point, you wouldn't want to take a rocket high speed elevator ride back to the top as you might get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness" target="_blank">the bends aka decompression sickness</a> but if you took a regular elevator you would be fine.</p>
<p>NOT Until  -65,000 ft. below sea level (equivalent to 200 ft. underwater) would your valley become a concern, as you would be in danger of experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">Oxygen Poisoning</a>  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I live at 4350' above sea level and will only occasionally hear of some person who just moved from the coast complain. Most of the time, people don't really notice.</p>
<p>As for me, I can't tell the difference any of the times I have visited low altitude places. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the way, we don't have to speculate about this - the Tautona Mine in South Africa starts at an elevation of about 1.6 km and has a maximum depth of 3.9 km, with mining actually being carried on by thousands of workers at depths up to 3.45 km, so that's about 6,000 feet below sea level. The atmospheric pressure does not cause any obvious problems. (At least, none that can be noticed past the many other much more pressing dangers, such as the high temperatures and inherent dangers of deep mining...)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v105n06p387.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> from South Africa on the hazards of deep mining suggests that nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity would only become a problem at 15-20 km, which is much deeper than any current mines go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are some graphs that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_Pressure_vs._Altitude.png" target="_blank">associate air pressure with altitude</a>. There is a formula but I'm done with Maths for today so I will do a estimate of a regression by eye.</p>
<p>At -5000', or around 1550 meters below, Air pressure should be around 120KPa of pressure, that's around 1.2 atmospheres.</p>
<p>That's nothing. You will probably be better at endurance because you would be breathing more oxygen than usual.</p>
<p>I don't know about oxygen poisoning, I will risk to say that you would end up fine if you stayed there for 1 or 2 hours. More than that I don't know (I need to know the values for the amount of oxygen needed to warm you, absortion rate and concentration of oxygen at that pressure).</p>
<p>EDIT: Changed pressure from 140Kpa to 120Kpa, I read the graph in the wrong way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the short answer to your question would be maybe.
there is something called reverse altitude sickness and it has to do with your body not acclimatizing well enough. when breathing below sea level, the partial pressure of O2 is increased however, your hemoglobin saturation does not increase to any significant usable level because at normal elevation your hemoglobin is already very well saturated with oxygen (~97% saturated). only thing that might make a difference is that now at increased pressure, you will have some oxygen dissolved in plasma (which normally doesn't occur at normal atmospheric pressure).
if coming from sea level and going down, you wouldn't normally feel any difference in breathing. however, if coming from high altitude to low altitude, you would feel a change in breathing based on your speed of descent
so really it all depends on how fast you are changing altitude. once your body acclimatize to change in atmospheric pressure, you will be fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
