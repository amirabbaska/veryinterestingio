		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that is seldom noted is that most of the basis for special relativity had already been laid down experimentally and mathematically prior to 1905, Maxwell's equations, the Michelson-Morely experiment, and the Lorenz equations being most notable. What Einstein did was put all these things together and studied their ramifications. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sort of happened with the <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/speed-light-galilean-relativity/" target="_blank">Fizeau water experiment</a> in 1851. Fizeau was trying to measure the change in the speed of light through moving water. What he found was that the interference pattern between light that went through &quot;forwards&quot; and &quot;backwards&quot; water was about half as strong as it would be if the speed of light through the water were (c/n+v) and (c/n-v), where n is the index of refraction and v is the velocity of the water. We now know that if you apply the special relativity velocity addition formula , you get a factor of about 0.43 compared to the naive prediction, explaining Fizeau's result.</p>
<p>That being said, it's possible that the history of science could have progressed differently than it actually did, perhaps reaching the space age before relativity was discovered and noticing more anomalous effects. But, that's not what happened, so we can only speculate. Eventually, someone would have tried to theorize about what was happening to cause these anomalous measurements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had designed GPS without knowing about relativity. &quot;Just triangulate the positions based on the time of travel from space to you!&quot; </p>
<p>But without compensating for relativity, the clocks on all the satellites appear to drift a little bit, making the system fail miserably.</p>
<p>If you're looking to fix the system, you might find that the noise is predictable.  Whether the equations you'd find would be the same as Einstein's is uncertain. For starters you'd be likely to lump the effects of special and general relativity together. And there are many other concepts in the theories of relativity that would be hard to derive from just that data set, such as the equivalence of mass and energy (E = mc^2 ).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I can't remember what the name of the book is but basically these creatures live in an asteroid in an exotic location, and through empirical observation, some key enquiring minds begin to understand relativity.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone will chime in with the name of the book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were a few empirical clues. Mercury's orbit is not adequately explained without it, but the main one is that light always seems to travel at the same speed.</p>
<p>This velocity and the transformations (equations) that leave it unchanged were already discovered as part of Maxwell's equations. I don't know what line you are drawing for discovering something mathematically vs. empirically, but having those transformations fall out of a set of equations built around empirical observation of radio waves might count.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
