		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like this: If you film someone running forwards (positive) and then play the film forward (positive) he is still running forward (positive). If you play the film backward (negative) he appears to be running backwards (negative) so the result of multiplying a positive and a negative is negative. Same goes for if you film a guy running backwards (negative) and play it normally (positive) he appears to be still running backwards (negative). Now, if you film a guy running backwards (negative) and play it backwards (negative) he appears to be running forward (positive). Even if you speed up the rewind (-3x or -4x) these results hold true. Backward x backward = forward. Negative times negative = positive.
Edit: Thanks for the kind words and super thanks for whoever gave me my first gold. This analogy was just something my 7th grade teacher said one time and it stuck with me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I teach seventh grade math.  </p>
<p>Most of the replies I've seen in this thread are &quot;intuition pumps&quot; rather than mathematical arguments.  </p>
<p>Here's the actual answer. The rule that negative times negative equals positive is required for distribution to continue working once the number system is expanded to include negative numbers.  </p>
<p>Distribution is the basis of multiplying. For example, if you multiply 17 x 10, you can do (10)(10)+(10)(7) to find the value. This continues to work for multiplications of larger numbers, and is the basis for the standard algorithm for multiplying.  </p>
<p>Once you introduce negatives into the number system, you have to consider how the algorithms based on distribution will continue to work.  </p>
<p>I assume that you agree that a positive times a negative is a negative. That is, that you understand that multiplying 3*(-5) means &quot;start at 0, count left or down by 5, 3 times [so that you end on on -15].&quot;  I also assume that you understand that the sum of opposites is zero, so that 1 + (-1) = 0.</p>
<p>Now, consider the following expression:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(-1)*[1+(-1)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recognize that the expression equals 0, because the sum in the brackets is 0, and anything times 0 is 0.  </p>
<p>But consider the following equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(-1)*[1+(-1)] = 0  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By distributing, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we already know that (-1)(1) = -1, then the equation above can be rewritten as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So all that remains is to understand what (-1)(-1) is equal to. And here's the point: What can you add to (-1) to get 0 in the above equation? It must be (positive) 1--which was to be shown.  </p>
<p>Since the reasoning is perfectly general, you can prove the same for any two negatives.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of a number as a dot on a number line.  Think of it as an arrow starting at zero and pointing to that number.  The greater the number, the longer the arrow.  A negative number has the same length as its corresponding positive number, but is pointing the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Think of multiplying by a negative as a command to reverse your direction.  So if you have A*5 it means &quot;multiply by 5&quot;, and if you have A*(-5) it means &quot;reverse your direction, then multiply by 5&quot;.</p>
<p>If you take a negative number and multiply by another negative number, you are reversing the direction of the original arrow (which was pointing towards negative), so it ends up pointing in the positive direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
