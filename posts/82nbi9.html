None of them would be in the way of launching. If they were all below, in the hanger bay, it would take hours to get them flying. In states of readiness, most of the aircraft on deck are manned with crews, ready to be in the air in five minutes or less. It’s called ‘Ready 5’. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eighty + aircraft is a lot to store even on board a Nimitz Class Aircraft Carrier.  Not all planes are stored on deck, usually those that have impending missions or flights coming up.</p>
<p>During Flight Ops, a rescue helicopter is launched in case an aircraft goes down. During Fleet Operations, an E-2 is usually orbiting providing the 'eyes' for the fleet.  A CAP of fighters is usually orbiting to provide immediate defense for the ship.  Several planes are on deck in 'Ready' Status, Ready 5, Ready 15, Ready 30.</p>
<p>ASW Airplanes are ready to launch if needed.  </p>
<p>During highly intense Air Operations, a Nimitz is the busiest airport in the world, with launches and recoveries spaced two minutes apart.  The arresting wires are kept clear to recover planes and only one or two of the catapults is loaded with Ready 5 aircraft.</p>
<p>There is a small compartment in the island with a maps of the flight deck and models of all of the planes with their status listed.  </p>
<p>Some of the planes in the hangers are being stored, some are undergoing maintenance.</p>
<p>My knowledge is 30 years old but I don't think it's changed much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Operational readiness. It's a lot faster to launch an aircraft when it's already waiting on the deck than having to lift it from the internal hangars first.</p>
</li>
<li>Space. If you keep aircraft both on the deck <em>and</em> in internal hangars, you can keep many more on the ship than if you only had them inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's worth noting that not all navies do this. Keeping armed and fueled aircraft on the deck has the disadvantage of a  risk of fire breaking out and quickly spreading between the parked aircraft. Check out the USS Forestal fire if you want to see how much damage that can cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people aren't aware of this but the aircraft carriers have two decks,  <a href="https://goo.gl/images/jY2GAx" target="_blank">forward deck blue arrow and angled deck red arrow</a>.  Although both can be used to launch aircraft, when underway the forward deck is usually a parking lot. </p>
<p>Planes can be parked in such a way that the back half of the plane is hanging off the deck. We call it TOW, or tail over water. You can see in this <a href="https://goo.gl/images/hBtCsX" target="_blank">pic</a>.</p>
<p>You can also see in the picture above that the forward deck's catapult is open to launch because of the amount of room created by parking the planes TOW. </p>
<p>The planes wings also fold up to make them pack easier. It takes only a few minutes to spread the wings and shoot the pins to lock the wings. You can see <a href="https://goo.gl/images/q4v1jX" target="_blank">here</a>, all the planes have their wings folded. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
