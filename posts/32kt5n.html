		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of development that isn't too tied to technological growth.</p>
<p>For instance, something like the Elder Scrolls games are really large.  But being really large is really that they have a lot of content. </p>
<p>There are many assets (models, animations, sounds), but they get reused a fair bit too.  When you make the game, you don't make it at once.  You make say a set of textures for walls, or some wagons and barrels, some flowers, etc. </p>
<p>First things first you need to do this in concept, so you have ideas of how all of the areas are going to look. This is mocked up, it's not final.  You do this for a big part of the world, the major parts.  You develop the major storyline, you develop the larger side stories, etc.</p>
<p>Then before any actual work gets to be done on graphical assets (which are most likely going to change over time) certain targets get set as to how it's going to look, how much video memory is going to be needed, how level of detail will degrade things, the view distance targeted, etc. </p>
<p>In the mean time, a lot of stuff can get done without the assets being complete.  Stories can be written, quests can be written, quests can be scripted, a lot of this can be done with placeholder data.  </p>
<p>The engine grows at the same time.  For instance, the format and the editor for something like TES4 is very similar to TES3, and even Fallout 3.  When you go to TES5 you see a bunch of stuff from Fallout still in the editor, like the VATS stuff . When you look at the editor for Fallout you see a bunch of spell stuff from TES4 in it. </p>
<p>So you spend time building the world, this is done on paper or as concept.  In something like TES you already know what the world looks like.  You build the stories, you write the dialog, at some point you have people come in and voice the dialog.  You build the stories, you test the stories.  TES games for instance have a pretty open scripting system that is pretty independent to the environment.  It's mostly just built on waypoints and triggers. So you can put together quest lines even while the models for the environment don't exist if you wanted to, and afterwards you just have to make sure that there's not some weird pathing issue that stops someone from going from waypoint A to waypoint B the way you expect it to.</p>
<p>Then there's people who design the regions, and they do it in such a way that a city is going to look best where the view distance is set at a minimum expected level, so for instance, you maybe want the player to open the gates and see the towering spires of the castle for maximum impact.  You don't necessarily want them to open the gate, and have the castle just a bit too far in the distance. </p>
<p>When you're making the models, you make try and target them so that they will look good on the hardware that you expect to see in the future.  You might give the ability to lower the complexity of the models or the textures to accommodate lower end hardware.  But you don't know exactly where it's going to sit.  But that doesn't mean that you're stuck forever.</p>
<p>I'll use TES for an example because it's an example of a large scale game that takes a lot of time to complete.  Everything in the game world except the exterior terrain is a model.  Many models are reasonably simple.  A crate is going to be pretty simple regardless.  A horse cart is going to be pretty simple.   Some things might need to be spruced up, maybe a monster like a goblin is made early in the game's life cycle for testing, but 3 years later you want something that looks better.  You just rebuild the goblin, no big deal.  You find something is featured reasonably prominently and it looks dated, you rebuild that.  </p>
<p>Then the engine can change apart from the assets.  Maybe new shader support is available, and you really think this HDR bloom thing looks awesome so you crank it up to 11 in TES4.  Maybe there's a way to interpolate animations a bit nicer and you work it to let it work with your existing animations. Maybe you can just crank up draw distance even further than you expected.  The engine limitation isn't an asset limitation.</p>
<p>I played Final Fantasy XII a little while ago, which was a release for the PS2, but it was another game that took a long time (5 years) in development.  I played it on an emulator on my PC though, which let me run it at a high resolution.  The majority of the content actually looked much better on the PC because the resolutions used were much higher than necessary to run on the PS2.  Some elements did look out of place because they were just good enough to look right on the PS2.</p>
<p>But for a lot of games like TES, there's a lot that is really more limited by engine than anything like assets. The big things that changed between generations of TES games are things like the way faces were generated, (any improvement of which over development happens game wide), and a few ways that certain technical elements, particle effects, materials and shaders can be used.  Many of these things weren't new technology, just something that wasn't common at the time.  For instance, Morrowind didn't make much use of normal maps, but they did exist.  Video memory and capabilities were too limited to make use of them substantially, but the engine can actually support a limited amount of bump mapping as it is.  Players have been able to go back and add things like bump maps to the game.  </p>
<p>Now for the developers themselves, if they were developing morrowind and video capabilities took a large leap forward and normal maps would have made the game look a lot better, they could have gone through and created them for all the existing assets.  It would be a large undertaking, but it wouldn't invalidate old work done. </p>
<p>But look at some of the things that players have done by themselves to change the look and feel of a game like skyrim with barely touching the assets.  Plugins that add additional shader options, add motion blur or depth of field.  </p>
<p>The thing is that ultimately if a game is in development for 4-5 years, the content isn't all finalized in the first couple of years.  A lot of the work in the first years is going to be planning, and conceptual.  Then when the assets are built, most of those assets are going to look as good or as bad as the engine. </p>
<p>The difference is when things are really technically tight, things like an FPS or a fighting game, or anything else with lots of closeups and tightly controlled environments will have different issues.  In those situations every scene might be tailor made to take full advantage of certain hardware or work in very specific ways.  But those games don't tend to take the same amount of development time.  But it would be a reason why a game like Duke Nukem Forever would be severely impacted by changes to the engine.  Games like Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim all use an evolution of the same engine. It's pretty general, it's used for expansive vistas and plug and play scenery. It can be beautiful, but it's beautiful in depth, not because every element is hand crafted.  The same barrels and dust piles and books and chairs are rubber stamped around the world. </p>
<p>The big reason why a game like the elder scrolls games can survive a 4-5 year development cycle is because their appeal isn't because they've kept up with technological growth.  Skyrim isn't a technological marvel.  It's not ugly by any means, but for the detail of each individual object wasn't state of the art when the game came out.  The games are built to be impressive in terms of scale, this is why they need lots of development time, it's also why you still see Skyrim stuff all over the place today despite the fact that the game was released 4 years ago. It wasn't state of the art then, it's not state of the art now, but that's OK, the game doesn't need to be state of the art to be impressive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things that make it easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological growth is pretty predictable.  CPUs, GPUs, chipsets etc themselves take a long time to actually design and build.</li>
<li>You only need the hardware to be consumer level when you release.  When you're working on a game, you're using powerful machines.</li>
<li>Companies like Bethesda have close ties with manufacturers, and get the hardware (and often consulting help from the company) early.</li>
<li>It's only reasonably late in the process that you need to bring everything together and run it at full quality.  If your development machine isn't powerful enough, you'd switch some stuff that you don't care about off; and/or run at much lower quality.  (IE if you're doing sound, you don't need the full lighting pipeline switched on...)</li>
<li>When you're developing anything big, you do your best to split it up into discrete components, so that bits can be swapped in and out as necessary.  You likely know what didn't work in your last game (eg if the sound system was shite) and so can plan to replace it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can plan and make improvements on the systems so long as you know vaguely what you need to fix.  There's a lot in the games that isn't graphics-related (and hence can usually run many years earlier on powerful workstations), and even the stuff that is you can likely isolate.  If you can't isolate it, then you just run the game at a lower quality or framerate.  In the case of fallout 4, there was probably a significant design phase.</p>
<p>TL;DR: most people don't need full graphics at full speed all the time.  Only graphics-related stuff has the risk of the technology shifting, and even that's usually quite unlikely because it's just numbers that go up (usually predictably) and not fundamental methods of rendering changing.  When things do change more significantly, you have a heads up from your vendors (often this info is pretty publicly published).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let's use Elder Scrolls as an example then.</p>
<p>The problem with the game industry is that the marketing department has been tasked with technological advertisement. This is why age old mechanisms are now pawned off as next generation. Division of virtual space into smaller sub-spaces? Try the 1950's.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls series has pretty much used the same scene loading technique since the 1990's. It is the same technique that was used in the Tribes series (Torque Game Engine) and King's Quest: Mask of Eternity. It was going to be the mechanism that Tim Sweeney used for the Unreal Engine way back when.</p>
<p>When you &quot;open&quot; a door into a home or business in Skyrim, it uses the same same technique that was used in Daggerfall. Once the door is &quot;opened&quot; new geometry is loaded into memory. Some call this an &quot;outside/inside&quot; scene management mechanism. In the old days, it was a likely a mixture of a BSP tree for &quot;inside&quot; and quad/octree for &quot;outside&quot;. Both techniques are nothing but mechanisms for reducing the number of polygons that have to be drawn.</p>
<p>These days, they probably don't use a BSP tree anymore. The loading scheme is still used because it reduces the amount of memory required during gameplay. It also reduces the complexity of the game AI. Take Whiterun for example. How would you handle a dragon attack while in the city? How would you keep main story NCP safe from harm or death? You load the internal area separately and make the guards crazy strong and skilled.</p>
<p>But yeah, most of these mechanisms were developed in the 1950's, 60's, 70's and 80's for various reasons (military, real estate, VR, etc). Most people don't know this because GPU manufacturers need to dazzle the consumer digital wizardry. The marketing departments are good at what they do. We are now going back to direct frame-buffer access like the old DOS days and even this is being portrayed as next generation technology.</p>
<p>With regards to specific rendering techniques, they read research whitepapers like everyone else. Some times, the game company will contract the researcher to oversee the implementation. ID Software did this twice that I know of. Once with Seth Teller (Doom-Quake scene management) and another guy whose name I cannot remember (Doom 3). </p>
<p>It's not really effective to have a single person implement all aspects of a game engine these days. When Tim Sweeney tried, his super-duper software routines were quickly shelved for Glide support. It was the 3dfx Voodoo cards that put Unreal on the map in 1998. Had Unreal shipped in 1996, it is very likely that Quake would not have been as ground breaking as it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>You anticipate developments and design a game for hardware that doesn't yet exist. A big developer will also get engineering samples prior to their sale to the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>You don't release for hardware that is brand new, but release for hardware that is a couple years old.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in the early stages of development your game is targeted at graphics cards that won't come out for another two or three years, but in the later stages of development your minimum hardware requirements are the current state of the art/most expensive hardware, and by the time you actually release your minimum requirements are now common hardware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELIF: When a video game is in development for 4-5 years (like the Elder Scrolls series), how do they keep up with technological growth?
-The game teams have a &quot;Core Technology&quot; or &quot;Engine Team&quot; that is constantly adding new tech into the engine as it comes online. At Alpha or Beta stages they stop adding new tech and concentrate on fixing existing bugs. Otherwise you'd never get better rendering, or snow/grass deformation, DX12 or larger worlds(this requires streaming technology).
We throw everything we want in to the game and then remove/tone down until it runs at 30fps. 60 for ratchet and clank.
That's the long-short of it.</p>
<p>&quot;I read that Bethesda has been working on Fallout 4 since before Fallout: New Vegas was released.&quot; </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could just be pre-production which is just figuring out the feel of the game, basic plot points, theme, characters, environment, making new tech that shows the gimmic of the game, streamlining existing systems and a green-light version to demonstrate the &quot;vision&quot; of the game. </p>
<p>You don't release for hardware that is brand new, but release for hardware that is a couple years old.
&quot;If they are developing a game to run on hardware from the future, how do they do beta testing? Do they just have monster computers hooked together? Do they turn just turn the graphics down?&quot;   </p>
</li>
<li>For consoles to be pass certification, they must run on the manufacture provided Beta kits(If you're trying to hit console launch year, other wise you use a dev kit which is a retail kit with more memory and access to software that lets you view the registers and see call stacks.) Every console has it's own function calls for rendering and OS calls for networking and storefront, DLC models. All that can't be guessed at, must work and it is all tested. If anything fails, Sony/MS/Nintendo won't let it on their console.</li>
