		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with energy and electrons. The electrons in the material (eg. glass) can only have certain energy levels. If one of them can be at say 1, 1.3, and 2 (ignoring units here for a second), nothing that would bump it to an energy of say 1.6 or 3 would be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with light? I'm glad you asked. Light in a material is absorbed by the electrons in the material. However much energy the photon of light had is used to raise the electron's energy by that exact amount. The amount of energy a photon has is dictated by its wavelength. Blue light has more energy than red light, ultraviolet has even more.</p>
<p>Glass can't absorb visible light because the electrons in glass have an energy gap larger than the energy of light in the visible spectrum, so the electrons aren't able to interact with it. Higher energy light (like ultraviolet) will be absorbed because it can match the energy needed for the electrons to jump up a level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absorption of light in a material typically relies on exciting elections in the material to higher energy states.  For a material to be transparent there must be a lack of availability of allowable energy states to transition to.   A material like glass has a large band gap between allowed energy levels so visible light is not absorbed.   </p>
<p>Light can also be scattered in a material at impurities and interfaces.  To prevent scattering a material should be essentially homogenous down to a scale comporable to the wavelength of the light.   Water and glass are both very homogenous in consistency.  Even though they do not have a perfect crystal structure (one is liquid and one is an amorphous solid) they have a consistent density and composition.  Milk on the other hand is a solution of small particles suspended in water, so is nonuniform on the necessary length scale.  Likewise glass which is broken and ground into a powder will lose much of its transparency and appear white due to increased reflectance.</p>
<p>Colorful materials typically contain dye molecules or atoms with discrete allowed energy levels.  This allows more selective absorption of specific colors of light.  Most of the energy from the absorbed light is lost as heat, but some materials are able to reemit specific colors of light by fluorescence.  A combination of these absorption and scattering effects produce the visual properties of the materials we are familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered this question well on the specifics but I'd like to point out that light can pass through &quot;opaque&quot; matter. It all comes down to the intensity of light (or radiation in general) and the thickness and type of matter. You can try this at home:</p>
<p>Use a flash light (the more powerful the better) in a preferably dark room. Push it against your arm and you probably don't see any light trough. Then push it against your hand and you should see light shining through. If it doesn't work use a smaller and smaller stack of paper instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers in this thread are talking about absorption, but they really are missing half of the problem. The most important half imo. </p>
<p>Some materials absord more than others
because they have transition between energy levels that correspond to the energy of a photon. True. But that really doesn't explain why you can see through a cloud, water is transparent, air is transparent, yet a cloud isn't. </p>
<p>The reason you can't see through a cloud, and actually through most non-metallic materials, is diffusion. The light scatter (or bounce) on the inhomogeneities of the matterial like the droplets in a cloud. This forces the light to stay within the material for a long time, long enough for the light to be absorded even if the material doesn't absorb much. </p>
<p>This is also why you can see through most cristals even if they do absorb a lot. They don't have much inhomogeneities, the light goes straight through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
