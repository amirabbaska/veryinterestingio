		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from stuff that's already been mentioned, one big difference is how concentrated the forces are. If you're pulling straight apart, you're trying to break the whole surface area loose at the same time. If you twist, the perimeter breaks free first, followed by smaller and smaller circles, because the center doesn't move as far as the outside does. You also have some leverage on the center parts of the joint that you don't have when pulling straight apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Twisting puts most of the force on the surface of the frosting, so it breaks cleanly from the cookie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>sticky things like to hold onto other things - kind of like how stepping in deep mud makes it hard to pull your foot straight out. the mud moves around, and tries to hold onto your foot.</p>
<p>The cream in an oreo (or cheese between crackers) is also a bit sticky. pulling straight up means you're trying to pull a big surface off a large amount of sticky stuff - a bit like a big boot in some mud. </p>
<p>Twisting is a different type of force - you're not trying to pull straight up, you're <em>slightly</em> separating the big biscuit surface from the sticky part, which weakens the hold that the sticky part has on the large surface, by making it move around so much that it loses stickiness (a bit like how taffy can stretch really far but if you stretch it far enough, it breaks - the soft filling is very, very, very, very slightly stretchy) - and then the amount of effort needed to pull apart the biscuits is a lot less.</p>
<p>Also, the biscuits are stronger in one direction than another - pulling straight up makes the sticky part hold the biscuit at different points, meaning you're likely to break the biscuit before they seperate. twisting means you're pushing on the biscuit in a way that it probably won't break, and you'll be able to break the sticky effect of the filling before the biscuit breaks (usually!).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
