		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current level of activity is normal. On average, there are usually ~20 volcanoes in some stage of erupting at any given time. The recent news worthy eruptions (e.g. Hawaii and the recent one in Guatemala) are not connected. So the short answer it's just the coverage and/or the fact that these two eruptions are happening in populated places and that both are being filmed a lot by locals (mostly safely in the case of Hawaii and <strong>really</strong> unsafely in the case of the Guatemalan eruption, you should never be as close to a pyroclastic flow as some of the people shooting video are). As for the rates, couldn't find any particularly good plots, but you can check out <a href="http://volcano.si.edu/reports_weekly.cfm" target="_blank">the smithsonian</a> weekly eruption report to 1) get a sense that there are lots of eruptions going on that aren't making the news and 2) if you go back into the archives, which span ~18 years, you can get a somewhat qualitative sense that this number of currently erupting volcanoes isn't particularly odd. As a side note, this is not quite real time, so this is the summary for last week so it doesn't yet include the eruption in Guatemala.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is worth noting that the current eruptions at Kīlauea in Hawaii and Fuego in Guatemala are nothing new.  Kīlauea has been in a constant state of eruption since Jan. 1983.  More than 35 years. A few weeks ago a dike intruded further east into the Lower East Rift Zone, causing the fissure eruptions that have been so much in the news.  It’s been a long time since Kīlauea burnt down any houses, but as soon as it does it suddenly gets media attention and a lot of people think it’s a new eruption when in fact it’s just another phase of the activity that started in 1983 - just at a new vent location. </p>
<p>Volcan Fuego too has been in a frequent state of eruption for years now, with frequent Strombolian activity and often sending lava flows down the various arroyos descending around the summit.  Only when it enters a more explosive phase, producing pyroclastic density currents that kill people, does it make the news.  Thus further adding to the general impression that there has been an increase in volcanic activity world-wide, when in fact this is not true. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's this emergency website, you can monitor all sorts of stuff going on in real time. There's tons of small earthquakes (rarely more than 2.5 on the scale), volcano eruptions, lots of fires, small airplane crashes and other similar stuff going every single day. It's normal. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much that there’s more ‘recently’ it’s that pretty much everyone has got a camera in their hands at any given moment. I think some of the pyroclastic flows have dedicated web cameras and live streams (especially the Hawaii ones) the technological/digital age is a heck of a time to be alive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
