From a performance perspective, wouldn't one be more interested in spacing out dosage to reset tolerance? Even with stimulants like caffeine, do you get the most bang for your buck by taking it every day in low dosage, or by spacing them out some amount?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re not prescribed for performance reasons because of the risk of addiction (and other negative health effects). Those downsides are only considered “worthwhile” if there’s a significant problem that they would solve. This is the whole point of <em>prescribing</em> certain medicines rather than making them freely available, and stimulants aren’t the only example of medicines restricted in this way. </p>
<p>The benefits may also be smaller for people without ADHD. Stimulants improve focus and energy, and are used illegally to improve performance (especially with academics). But if a person is <em>able</em> to focus on a task consistently/long-term without the drugs, the possible improvement is smaller than somebody who can’t do that at all. </p>
<p>With ADHD, consistent use is part of a treatment plan that intends to develop good <em>habits</em> as well as methods like organization to support better productivity, focus etc.</p>
<p>Without the need to address those issues or maintain structure/consistency as part of the treatment plan, consistent use may have more downsides (tolerance etc) and occasional use would be better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised no one has mentioned the dopamine hypothesis.</p>
<p>ELI5 -</p>
<p>People that have ADHD are different than most people because one of the chemicals that helps their brain think is lower than in most people. Taking medication helps that chemical be more like normal people so those people can think like normal people too! If you don't have that problem the medicine can't help and those people end up taking it for the other things it can do.</p>
<p>ELI20</p>
<p>The dopamine hypothesis basically says that ADHD is a constellation of symptoms of which many are due at least in part to low levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. This area of the brain dopamine activity is associated with regulating aspects of working memory function and planning and attention. </p>
<p>Amphetamines can act in a number of ways to keep synaptic dopamine levels higher than they normally otherwise would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People suffering from ADHD are less self-stimulated. Because of that they tend to look for external stimuli (/distractions) and can be hyper. One would wonder why give a stimulant to someone already hyper. You would think that's counterintuitive right? However, what the stimulant does is stimulates their mind and reducing the need to seek external stimulation. Now someone that is already internally stimulated, a stimulant overstimulates them and they end up crashing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say on a regular person performs a 7 on a scale of productivity. Adding a stimulant like Adderall is only going to boost them to like a 8 or 9. They were already doing great in the first place though, but it comes with plenty of side effects like extreme loss of appetite, nausea, etc. and risk of addiction.</p>
<p>Now let's look at someone with ADHD who performs a, say, 2 on a scale of productivity. This affects their ability to function on a daily basis and they can't complete basic tasks. Taking Adderall boosts them to like a 5 or 6. This allows them to do things they couldn't accomplish without the stimulant, unlike regular person who was already doing alright at their thing. There are some downsides to taking Adderall, but person with ADHD decides that it's worth it to be able to do the things they need to. They will also often work closely with their psychiatrist prescribing the drug to ensure that the side effects don't outweigh benefits.</p>
<p>Regular people can boost performance through other stuff like regular exercise, healthy diet and balanced lifestyle (adopting moderate hobbies, socialising with people, etc.) without much negative side effects so there's no real benefit to taking stimulants since regular people brains can chemically function well on their own.</p>
<p>This is kind of similar to asking: why can't a person without diabetes take insulin injections? Theoretically, yes? It just fucks you up badly and doesn't have much benefits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
