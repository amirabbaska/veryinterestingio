		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit, we are paleontologists <strong>Chris Noto</strong> and <strong>Stephanie Drumheller-Horton</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>From Dr. Noto:</strong> I been fascinated by ancient life for as long as I can remember. At heart I am a paleoecologist, interested in fossil organisms as once living things inhabiting and interacting with each other and their environment. Currently I am an assistant professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside.</p>
<p><strong>From Dr. Drumheller-Horton:</strong> My research falls into two broad fields: taphonomy (the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it) and crocodylian evolution/behavior. I am an assistant adjunct professor and lecturer in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Texas was a very different place 95 million years ago.</strong> Dinosaurs and crocodiles dominated a lush coast, preserved as a rich fossil bed in Dallas-Forth Worth called the Arlington Archosaur Site (AAS). The AAS is an important, productive fossil locality that preserves a previously unknown fauna from this part of North America. </p>
<p>The rocks here contain a rare record of ecosystem transition, when major groups of dinosaurs and other animals were changing significantly. The AAS preserves a nearly complete coastal ecosystem, providing an unparalleled glimpse into the life that existed here over 95 million years ago. Thousands of specimens have been recovered including previously unknown dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and plants. The diversity, abundance, and quality of the material is extraordinary. </p>
<p>The site is run in partnership with amateur volunteers, creating a unique citizen-science initiative with far-reaching education opportunities for the surrounding community. You can find us on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Arlington-Archosaur-Site-188601874524788/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
<hr />
<p>We will be back at 1:30ET to answer your questions. Ask us anything!</p>
<p><strong>Edit: and we're off! Thank you so much for a great AMA!</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What sort of information can you get from the surrounding rock about how the organism died? Can you also determine then how long a body might have been exposed before being buried? </p>
<p>I once heard a paleontologist say he loved looking at dead cows in a field since it gave clues to dinosaur fossils and how he finds them. He mentioned he likes to get as much of the surrounding rock as he can from around a fossil to learn more, but he didn't expand much into what can actually be determined from the surrounding rock around a fossil. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What has changed at the site since Dr. Main was there and what newer finds have you all discovered? Will there be any more opportunities to work more closely with UTA in the future? </p>
<p>Additionally, I'm about to go to grad school for geomorphology but paleo was one of my favorite classes. What, if any, opportunities are there in the professional world for someone with an MS in a specialization outside of paleo? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
