		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A car with one window open acts like a Helmholtz resonator, the same kind of resonator as an empty beer bottle. The sound you hear is essentially the same as if you were sitting in the bottom of a beer bottle that someone was blowing across, but the &quot;blowing&quot; is supplied by the motion of your car forcing air into the open window.</p>
<p>In a Helmholtz resonator, the air in the neck (the open window) pushes against the air in the volume (the car's cabin). The air in the neck acts like a mass and the air in the volume acts like a spring, creating a one-degree-of-freedom oscillator. After substituting for the mass of the air in the window and the stiffness of the air in the cabin, you can create the equation.</p>
<p>f=(c/2π)√(S/L'V)</p>
<p>Where f is the resonant frequency, c is the sound speed in air (343 m/s), S is the surface area of the neck, L' is the effective neck length, and V is the cavity volume.</p>
<p>Let's run some numbers for a theoretical car. For a midsize car, the cabin volume will usually be around 2.5 m^3 and an open window might be 0.5 meters on each side (0.25 m^2 ). Based on numbers from an <a href="http://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~fmfp/FMFP%20PROC/am_13.pdf" target="_blank">industry source</a>, the frequency for a Sedan would be about 30 Hz. We can use this to find the effective length of the neck from the open window.</p>
<p>Plugging in the numbers, I got 0.3314 m (a little over a foot). Considering how narrow the window pane is, that sounds reasonable to me because the effective length of the neck here is almost entirely created by the end correction. For the interested, the canonical neck length correction is L' = L + 4/5 √(S). For this problem that would give something around 45 cm. However, neck corrections for Helmholtz resonators are notoriously dependent on the neck geometry, so it's not surprising to see it off by so much!</p>
<p>Of course, this explains the resonance, but it doesn't explain the source of the sound being amplified. That, it turns out, comes from air hitting the front pillar of the car. When the smooth flowing air hits that sudden change in shape, this creates eddy currents in an effect known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_shedding" target="_blank">Vortex Shedding</a>. The frequency of the vortices is a function of the vehicle speed and the size and shape of the pillar. When the frequency of vortices matches up with the resonant frequency of the car, that's when you get the noticeable resonance!</p>
<p>Others have pointed out the &quot;glug glug&quot; of the air being pushed out of the car, but I think it's important to say that this action of the air is actually part of the forcing function for the vibrations, and not the reason they become so loud and monochromatic. However, if you open a second window, your resonator may no longer have a sufficiently enclosed volume to act as a gas spring.</p>
<p>In other words, the reason the gas spring works is because the air in the volume of the car has nowhere to go. So, as opposed to flowing, it has to compress. If you open a second window, suddenly there's a path for that air to flow through, and the gas spring no longer has any stiffness. Essentially you cut the spring in the mass-spring damper system.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr The car acts like an empty beer bottle that someone's blowing across.</strong></p>
<p>Hope that answered your question!</p>
<p><em>Edit: Here's a little bonus. Here are some ways the frequency might change. If you have people in the car, the effective volume will drop and the frequency will go up. If you open the window more, the neck surface area will increase and the frequency will increase (but this will also change the length correction for neck, possibly offsetting the change). Driving faster should not change the frequency of the resonator, but it may increase the loudness. That said, since the length correction is a function of the inertial mass of the air in the window, the increased volume velocity might increase the neck length slightly and drop the resonant frequency. This theory needs more testing, though.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit2: If you are interested in learning more about this topic, look up</em> <strong><em>side window buffeting</em></strong> <em>online.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit3: I tweaked my numbers to better fit with a paper I found online. My new numbers seem to be much more on point, now.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit4: A lot of people are pointing out that the frequency in their car seems to be below 20 Hz and also has a &quot;wub wub&quot; quality where you can hear the individual cycles. According to /u/caboose2, mid-size sedans normally range from 14-17 Hz. After consulting <a href="http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2004;volume=6;issue=23;spage=37;epage=57;aulast=" target="_blank">the literature</a>, it seems that this &quot;infrasound&quot; is audible at very high levels (like in the car), but is perceived differently than sound in the range from 20-20000 Hz. This explains both the &quot;wub wub&quot; quality and the apparently low frequency. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/26vjj4/youre_driving_and_you_have_only_one_window_down/chv4ib2" target="_blank">See the comment thread for more.</a></em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to understand this is to think about what happens when you pour water out of a bottle. Usually it comes in waves (blub blub blub) with pauses in between. This is because as the water leaves the bottle, something must fill the space left behind by the water, this something is air. The air must <em>enter</em> the bottle through the same hole that the water is exiting so they end up taking turns entering and exiting, resulting in the blubbing sound you hear. If you poke a hole in the bottom of the bottle (ever shotgun a beer before?) the blubbing no longer occurs because the air can enter at the <em>same</em> time as the water is exiting. </p>
<p>Your car is the bottle, and the air entering the car through the window must be replacing air already in the car (water) so some air must exit as the new air enters.</p>
<p>Edit: The actual fluid dynamics behind why the air and water takes turns entering and exiting is way beyond me, maybe someone else can help with that? But hopefully you get the general idea</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as when you blow over the top of a bottle to make a whistling sound.  The bigger the bottle (or less liquid you have) the bass-ier the sound since the frequency with which the air comes in and out is lower.  Think of your car with one window down as the bottle.  Air will be coming in and out making that bass-y sound.  When you open another window the air has multiple ways to come in and out so it won't resonate the same way as with one window down</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies if this has been commented on already, but I only seem to notice this awful sound when only one of the back windows is rolled down. My front passenger window is currently not functioning so I typically drive with only my driver side window down without any womp womp womp sound. </p>
<p>Is it a phenomenon that only occurs when a rear window is rolled down or is that just particular to my car due to its size, aerodynamics, scientific factors, etc?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have a window open and air is rushing by, some will rush in. This air increases the pressure in the car. The increased pressure pushes back out and then you have decreased pressure in your car. Sound waves are compressions and decompressions of air, which is the same thing as what's being forced in your car.</p>
<p>The frequency this happens at is directly related to the size of the inside of your car, and for most cars it's in a low range of our hearing, so our ear drums pick it up.</p>
<p>When you crack another window, it prevents pressure from being able to build, and instead you have a balanced pressure inside your car which does not oscillate causing the noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
