		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was actually fought for. The amount of time spent at work was one of the major themes of labour/union movement struggles in europe and NA, starting in the early 1800's. The industrial revolution brought with it 12 and 16 hour days in factories, and once people started organizing, this was challenged. </p>
<p>One of the most successful movements was the &quot;Eight Hour&quot; and &quot;Nine Hour&quot; Movements in the mid 1800's to early 1900's, and the results of their successes helped grow a new standard of 8 hours. Strikes and riots were originally the tools used to make change (for example, the Haymarket massacre in Chicago and general strike on Philadelphia), but laws enforcing hours were either ineffective or non-existent. The normalizing of the 8-hour day (at least in NA) increased over the late 1800's to early 1900's in the form of various legislation, political campaign promises and some industries taking the lead (most notably Ford).  Arguably the standard was near universal by the time of the US depression in the 1930's, when the &quot;New Deal&quot; was implemented to provide more regulation of labour and a safety net for workers.</p>
<p>Although the 8 hour standard continued ever since, there are still problems to overcome, and efforts to improve to even lower hours. A significant problem is that, since the late 1970's, there has been a rise of precarious and part time work. Often workers in these jobs must work more than one job to earn a living, and as a result can often find themselves working more than 8 hours a day.</p>
<p>There have also been efforts to reduce the workweek, most notably in Europe, to 35 or 30 hours per week. Although these experiments have surely been a goal of labour movements, there has also been interest form a policy perspective and some employers have experimented with the idea (Sweden in particular).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 1800’s and early 1900’s many men would work 10-16 hour days but a guy named Robert Owen started a movement because he knew that this was too constraining on the workers so he proposed an 8 hour work shift as it fits most people’s ideal work day without working until your almost dead. Robert also started a campaign with the slogan, “Eight hours labor, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest”. His campaign eventually fell through as many people saw it fit because men were working so hard and the company’s that they would work for had complete control. Long work days and little pay. Eventually in the USA the government established minimum wage in 1938 and the 8 hour work day became the norm after Robert’s campaign became more nation wide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was the result of massive struggle.</p>
<p>People formed unions and organized workers and demanded &quot;8 hours for work, 8 hours for sleep, 8 hours for what we will.&quot;  </p>
<p>This took years,  Many strikers and organizers were beaten and some were killed.</p>
<p>8 hour work days became standard because workers paid for it in blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've got some good answers here already, but just to add - the 8 hour day first came into legislation in 1856, in Australia. The initial union movement rallies were held just next to where my office is now, so there's a monument I walk past most day!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Union struggle and some very interesting productivity research.
It used to be standard to work people as long as at all possible, but politically, that pissed labor off. (There are reasons communism was once popular. 12-16 hour work days was one of them), and then some of the major industrial concerns did some research into the effect of various work time arrangements on productivity. </p>
<p>It turns out that working people 70 hours a week was just stupid, because they were too exhausted to do much for any of those 70 hours. Shorter work weeks resulted in more actual work getting done, until you hit 40 hours, where diminishing returns kick in. </p>
<p>The massive industrial concerns that funded the research took it on board and implemented the 40 hour week, voluntarily. </p>
<p>.... The rest of the economy mostly kept working their employees into uselessness. Because their bosses were, essentially, idiots. They had not paid for the research, and believed they could get the same results by yelling more at their employees. At this point, the governments of the world more or less unanimously decided to protect idiot bosses from themselves and made the 40 hour week a law. It isnt just for your benefit. </p>
<p>Note that the &quot;40 hours is maximum output&quot; has two exceptions.
Exhaustion takes time to set in. The first week you do it you <em>do</em> get twice as much work out of people. It falls off very rapidly, however. But the results of that first week is why so many employers are idiots about this. They try working their employees harder because of some emergency.. and it works! Should they disbelieve their own eyes? </p>
<p>Oil rigs explicitly exploit this with 2 weeks /80 - two weeks off. That is a workable cycle.</p>
<p>The second is the category of &quot;Extremely overpaid&quot;. Your maximum capacity for work is also expended on things like your commute and the various tedious tasks of daily life. When the one percent work 50 hour weeks for their entire lives, it is because they are getting 10 more hours by having cleaning staff and living in the same building as their offices. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
