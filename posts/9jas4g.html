		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From this article I found, the answer is <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/would-my-dog-recognize-me-in-a-picture/" target="_blank">sometimes</a>. They're kind of bad at it, as dogs rely much more heavily on smell/hearing than sight, so they may or may not recognize <em>particular</em> photos. Some are easily confused by things like haircuts and camera angles.</p>
<p>The study was pretty small with only 12 dogs and 12 cats. When given the option of a handler picture vs. non-handler picture. The dogs chose their handler 88% of the time, while cats choose their handler only 54% of the time.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing though, is when they tested animals' abilities to recognize other animals in photos. Dogs were able to identify familiar dogs 85% of the time, while cats chose familiar cats a whopping 91% of times.</p>
<p>EDIT: Dropped the part where I referred to sight as a &quot;tertiary sense&quot;, I picked that up from elsewhere on reddit, so I can't define the term and shouldn't use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The University of Helsinki did a study back in <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131218095847.htm" target="_blank">2013</a> to see if dogs recognized their owners or other familiar faces from images versus unfamiliar faces.  Although the dogs were most interested in images of other dogs, unsurprisingly, the dogs were also interested in familiar faces versus ones they didn't know.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their brains respond specifically to human faces - &quot;Our Faces in the Dog's Brain: Functional Imaging Reveals Temporal Cortex Activation during Perception of Human Faces&quot; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149431" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149431" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149431</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A later study found that the areas activated when viewing human faces also activated when looking at dog faces - &quot;Awake fMRI reveals a specialized region in dog temporal cortex for face processing&quot; <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1115/" target="_blank"><a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1115/" target="_blank">https://peerj.com/articles/1115/</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Both of these studies used photos as stimuli, so it is likely that a dog would recognise their owners in photos as well as in real life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dogs don't really rely completely on sight. For example if put in front of a mirror for the first time they do not understand the phenomenon. They think it is another dog in the same room with them instead. </p>
<p>However if you present a their own scent to them they know what and who it is. They can also know their owners, other dogs they have met all by scent. Second they can also rely on their hearing to distinguish between people, other dogs, and animals.</p>
<p>So can they know who is in the picture yes sometimes, but they rely more heavily on what they hear and smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
