Humans just don't have (or need) that kind of genetic complexity for hair color (we don't need camouflage to gain a hunting advantage when we can simply chase prey animals until they collapse from exhaustion.) Humans can, however, occasionally suffer from <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/piebaldism" target="_blank">piebaldism</a> which is kind of the same thing, but it's a rare genetic developmental disorder rather than simple biological inheritance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't done any research specifically regarding a dogs chromosomes and genes, but from a little bit of genetics background we know that in humans, skin color is an example of incomplete dominance. </p>
<p>In incomplete dominance, two different alleles can create a blend between the two creating a different phenotype. This is why when a black person and a white person have a child, often times the child is a lighter shade of brown. </p>
<p>In dogs we can assume that the genes that decide fur color (not the same as skin color) can be codominant which results in both alleles being simultaneously expressed phenotypically. This is how a brown dog and a white dog can have spotty brown/white offspring. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is an example of codominance, a genetic occurrence where neither gene is fully dominant and thus the offspring expresses genes from both parents. While this does not occur for something like skin colour for humans, humans do have some traits that are potentially codominant, for example, blood type. There are 3 alleles (forms) of the gene that codes for blood types, I^A, I^B, and i. When a person's genotype (combination of genes) is I^A I^B, then they have the blood type AB, which is codominant because they have the receptors for both A type blood and B type blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have all colors, except black, in my hair(Although I do get one stray black hair popping up in a weird spot, like my shoulder, every now and then that I pluck). My beard is fairly unique, because it runs from bleach blond, in the center(around my lips), to red, and then to brown the closer to my ears it goes. It's a gradual shift that looks pretty neat. The hair on my head is mostly dark brown, but there is blond, red, and silver mixed lightly into it that you can see depending on the light. My arm hair is blond. My chest and body is light brown. I'm a calico. lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about dogs, but calico / tortiseshell cats arise e.g. from black coated mother and ginger father because coat colour is X linked, and female mammals shut down one of their X chromosomes at random (as dosage compensation for the fact that males have only one X), and it can be a different X in different cell lines, so they will develop black patches and orange patches.</p>
<p>Edit: it's for this reason that calico cats are almost always female</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
