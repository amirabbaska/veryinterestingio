<p>These things are so far away that they don't affect Earth at all. But the reason that the discovery is interesting is that exoplanets are already difficult to detect, but exomoons are even harder to find, so finding one (or even a &quot;candidate&quot;) is quite an achievement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/Rannasha said, this finding is particularly surprising because the (potential) moon around the distant gas giant was so large - by the available evidence, it itself is a gas giant! It's as if the planet Neptune was found to be in orbit around Jupiter. We didn't know that situation could even happen, and it's not clear how such a system could even be made! Collisions between proto-planets during the formation process may play a role, but we don't have enough information yet to say anything with certainty. In short, though, this expands our knowledge of how planet formation can work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to flag up one aspect of your post -  astronomers have <strong>not</strong> definitively found any exomoon (a moon orbiting another planet). Not yet anyway. What was found was that, while observing a known exoplanet (a planet which orbits a distant star) transit it's star (passed in front of it as we see it, blocking some of the light), the &quot;transit&quot; was followed by a tiny and possibly-not-even-real second dip which is consistent with the idea that there is another smaller object in the vicinity of the planet we knew about - a moon.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the reason these astronomers were searching for a moon around this planet (Kepler-1625b) with Hubble was because, in three transits seen by the Kepler space telescope, it initially seemed like there might have been more of these moon &quot;dips&quot; happening around the time of the planet's transit... But in this paper the astronomers reanalysed this with better data, and those little dips had all but dissappeared - they were just random noise in the telescope and probably not caused by any exomoon. And, in my opinion as an exoplanet astronomer, that is <em>by far</em> a more likely estimation for the signal seen here.</p>
<p>But the media has a habit of spinning &quot;there's a slight chance this thing we saw could be X, but probably not&quot; into &quot;ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOUND X&quot;. *<em>Sigh*</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>The moon itself can't directly affect us because it's so far away.</p>
<p>Research like this is not done because any direct effects are expected.</p>
<p><strong>Scientists</strong> choose to pursue this kind of work for a variety of reasons, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A desire out of curiosity to understand how the Earth and life on it came to be here.  By studying other solar systems we hope to learn more about the history of our own.  Is Earth unusual?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A desire out of curiosity to understand if life is common in the universe.  Are we alone?  By seeing how common nice planets are we can reduce some uncertainty.  Turns out nice planets may be pretty common.</p>
</li>
<li>A desire to do something hard that nobody has ever done before.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governments</strong> choose to fund projects like these for different and more practical reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Undirected scientific research can lead to unexpected useful discoveries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New technology has to be developed to do these projects which may also be useful for more practical purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The projects fund loads of science grad students, many of whom will do on to apply their scientific training to more practical careers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results inspire children to go into STEM fields and will end up solving important problems here when they grow up.</p>
</li>
<li>The projects employ lots of people which is both practically and politically useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the moon itself has no direct impact, but the project has lots of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Other stars are very far away, it is very difficult for us even to detect the existence of planets or moons that orbit other stars. </p>
<p>The greatest way that exoplanets and exomoons may affect us on Earth is that they could make our horoscopes incredibly complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
