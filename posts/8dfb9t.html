		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curium [Cm - 96] is used in X-Ray Spectrometers as an alpha particle emitter.  Mars Rovers (among others) used this tool.  It was also used a a fuel for thermoelectric generators in other spacecraft.  So not much really interesting &quot;everyday&quot; stuff.</p>
<p>Californium [Cf - 252] is a powerful neutron emitter.  So is useful for &quot;jump starting&quot; nuclear reactors. Also, from the wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners;[15] neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture;[60] and in portable metal detectors.[61] Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for gold and silver prospecting for on-the-spot analysis,[19] and to detect ground water movement.[62] The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%).[63] By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.[63]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again not as &quot;everyday&quot; interesting.  Don't be fooled by the &quot;portable metal detectors&quot;.  That is a very different animal from those beach combers use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depleted uranium (mostly U-238) has been used for tank armor, armor piercing rounds, etc because it is extremely dense (~19 times denser than water, 2.5 times denser than steel IIRC).</p>
<p>Another user mentioned curium for RTGs. Pu-238 is what is used in RTGs for space missions; both this and curium have a high specific activity (so relatively high decat rate per gram) and decat primarily by alpha decay, so they create lots of heat.</p>
<p>Radium used to be used for glow-in-the-dark watches! There's some cool history there that I'm too lazy to really type out on my phone, but the problem with it is that it emits higher energy radiation and for a long time, so it's really not a safe thing to wear and it was eventually banned. Tritium is used for those watches now, which is radioactive but it's a very low energy beta emitter, so you get effectively zero dose from a tritium watch.</p>
<p>Some more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lanthanum is often used for flints in lighters</li>
<li>Thorium has been used for lantern mantles (heat up thorium oxide and it glows bright white)</li>
<li>Erbium is used for to make pink glazes (similar to the old orange fiestaware that contained uranium)</li>

They're definitely <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=uranium+glass&amp;rlz=1C1CHHZ_enUS529US529&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb2KfvwMfaAhUUyYMKHTITDpMQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1304&amp;bih=653" target="_blank">beautiful</a> although they are less common today for food. You still find it used for green fluorescence standards for calibration though.</p>
<p>Also fiestaware used to use a different uranium compound as a glaze. Not so much anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thorium is used as a common additive to welding rods.</p>
<p>Uranium235 can be used to store hydrogen isotopes as a hydride within the metal. Heating it alters the equilibrium pressure. This is the preferred way to store tritium.</p>
<p>Strontium90 is used as an electron source.</p>
<p>A common strategy for making a neutron source is to combine an alpha emitter like americium or californium with beryllium, which then picks up the alpha particle and releases neutrons.</p>
<p>A specific lab example might be using a special californium source to measure the efficiency of a neutron detector. If the californium sample is itself watched with a charged particle detector, the exact instant of every fission can be recorded. Each fission releases a variable number of neutrons at a variety of energies, but the statistics for these quantities are well known. The time of arrival of neutrons at the detector under test is compared with the timestamps of fission events. The detector is a known distance from the source, so the velocity (and thus energy) of every neutron is known. The number of neutrons measured at each energy is compared with the number expected to intersect the detector.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gadolinium is widely used as contrast material for magnetic resonance imaging. Every time you get MRI contrast, you get a small amount of a heavy metal into your body.
