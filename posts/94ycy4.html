In general the mass distribution of a population of stars is given by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function" target="_blank">initial mass function</a> derived from empirical data. A quick and dirty IMF is</p>
<p><em>ϕ</em>(<em>m</em>) ∼ <em>m</em>^−2.35</p>
<p>which shows that as the stellar mass <em>m</em> grows the number of stars quickly decreases. <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/education/outerplanets/images_solsys/big/star_demographic.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a picture</a> illustrating the distribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger stars are definitely more rare. But stars are much easier to see than planets.</p>
<p>When we started to get a lot of data on exoplanets, the distribution was heavily skewed in favor of very large planets. But that's only because of our observation methods - larger planets were simply much easier to see, so that's what we saw.</p>
<p>Exoplanet surveying is a rapidly advancing field, though, and we've been finding more of the smaller planets over time. But we still need to get better before we can really tell how common different planet sizes are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger main sequence stars (stars which fuse hydrogen into helium), such as A and B class stars burn out much quicker than lower mass stars. While an A or B class might only last a few 100 million years, M class stars (red dwarfs) can live 100s of billions of years. As such, the universe gets progressively populated by smaller and smaller stars as hydrogen supplies dwindle and star formation slows down.</p>
<p>I don't have any accurate numbers on how much of the galaxy is populated by M class stars today as sources vary somewhat on this topic (Some saying upwards of 80%, while others as low as 60%), but it is generally accepted that it is at least over 50% which to answer your question: Yes it means that larger stars are more rare than smaller ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect of star mass is that the more massive a star is, the shorter life it has. Fusion only happens the core and in larger stars and there is no transfer of matter in and out of the core and more mass means higher pressure and faster fusion. </p>
<p>That means that the stars currently our galaxy is not the most likely stars to form. Say you have 10 dwarf stars and 100,000 supermassive stars being born every million years. But the supermassive only last 10 million years before they go supernova (forming more stars) or turn into a black hole. Red dwarf stars are small enough for convection to occur between the core and the rest of the star so they can use up all their hydrogen and can burn for over trillions of years. That is something you have to consider if you want to find the rarest mass of a star. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Theoretically, a gas giant might form more easily than a rocky one, so I’d say they could be more common, but we really don’t have enough info to go on yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
