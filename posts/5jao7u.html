		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several factors at play, and it seems to vary from individual to individual. The problem of addiction and alcoholism has been around for millennia, and we still don't have something we can point to, and say, &quot;There it is. There's the problem, right there.&quot;  </p>
<p>Genetics seem to have an influence. It can cause a tendency to be <em>prone</em> to addiction, but is not the causative factor. There are studies of identical twins, where one is addicted, and the other, not. There are also &quot;black sheep&quot; that come from a long and wide genetic history of normal intoxicant use, but these &quot;black sheep&quot; become addicts.  </p>
<p>Dr. Gabor Mate, in his book &quot;In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts&quot; postulates that it is a combination of a genetic predisposition to addiction, triggered by environmental conditions, which may include trauma, such as sexual molestation as a child.  </p>
<p>As time continues, and the consumption of intoxicants continues, it messes with the normal distribution of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. It is speculated that genetic vulnerabilities make this rewiring of the brain easier, and this is why some people are more prone to addiction.  </p>
<p>As the addiction takes hold over time, its effects begin to manifest in the environment of the addict. They spend time with other addicts, and tend to damage their relationships with the non-addicted. If you become drunk and aggressive, you don't get invited to too many parties...unless everyone else at the party tends to get drunk, too.  </p>
<p>At this point, the genetic tendency has been fully triggered, and the environment becomes one that fosters the consumption of intoxicants. The brain has become rewired so that pleasure by normal means is elusive, but can be had in an instant with another helping of the drug of choice.  </p>
<p>Now the spectre of withdrawal sets in....and to break the cycle requires a complete overhaul of one's life, as well as suffering the physical symptoms of withdrawal. At this point the addict feels trapped, hopeless, and alone. Feelings of shame, remorse and self-loathing are common...and again, the only escape from them is another dose.  </p>
<p>But there is some hope. It has been proven that participating in a community of recovery is beneficial to many addicts...indeed, most recovered addicts claim that the loss of a sense of isolation, the feeling of belonging to a fellowship, and the advice and support of other recovering addicts was instrumental in their recovery.   </p>
<p>I am an alcoholic in recovery. My brain is wired in such a manner that the consumption of the smallest amount of alcohol creates a powerful, and virtually irresistible, craving for more. I can't open a bottle of rum, have 2 drinks, and put the bottle on the shelf. I just can't. I will drink until that bottle is empty.  </p>
<p>Through my work in AA I have learned better patterns of behaviour. If I am feeling unsettled...lonely, stressed, anxious...I no longer reach for a glass, or a joint, or a line, or a pill to make me feel better. I have slowly brought the wiring in my brain to a more normal state.  </p>
<p>But I don't fool myself. The changes made to my brain are permanent, and if I have one drink, I risk falling back into state of addiction. This is why so many people fall &quot;off the wagon&quot;. They believe that a period of sobriety has provided a measure of control, and that they now possess the ability to moderate their consumption. In my personal experience, i have never met an addict or alcoholic that could PERMANENTLY moderate. Some manage to, for a time, but gradually slip back into a state where the neurotransmitters are only experienced with intoxication.  </p>
<p>So, I guess the short answer to your question is, &quot;Nobody knows. It's different for each addict.&quot; Personally, I find my life without intoxicants to be vastly more rewarding, and I am much happier.  </p>
<p>And maybe that's the root of it. People take drugs because they are unhappy, and want to change the way they feel. The genetically predisposed quickly find themselves in a position where the brain has rewired itself to the point where happiness is difficult to achieve without the drugs.  </p>
<p>For a better understanding of life as an alcoholic, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1odh2l/drug_addicts_of_reddit_what_is_youre_daily_routine/ccr5jdf/" target="_blank">here</a> is a post I wrote when I was just getting sober.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a lab that studies addiction as part of a research institute focused on addictions as a whole. I have had many conversations in lab meetings with my professor whom is an expert in addictions. </p>
<p>There are many avenues of research currently being explored as it relates to addiction. I can point people in the direction of two interesting avenues of research. First, is Neuropeptide-Y. It is a peptide, meaning protein based, neuromodulator active in the brain. You have no doubt heard of dopamine and serotonin. Well, to put it simply, neuropeptide-y operates at a level above these neurotransmitters as a neuromodulator having widespread prolonged effects. Some research has implicated it in relation to PTSD. You can google a paper written by Nulk, Schuh, and Burrell produced by the United States Military Academy. There is research currently being done at the institute at which I work regarding NPY and addiction. In summary, acute administration of NPY via injection directly into the brain of rats reduces behavioral indicators of cocaine addiction. The grant info can be found here: <a href="http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-DA021261-01A1" target="_blank">http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-DA021261-01A1</a></p>
<p>In addition, I am seeing a lot of things here that run contrary to things I understand about addiction. </p>
<p>For example, I am seeing the self-medication explanation frequently here. The reality is that a self-medication theory would be supported by research that shows when the underlying issue that an individual is 'self-medicating' goes away, the addiction goes away. This is generally not the case from what I recall. Within that subgroup, there are individuals who are heavy users that get addicted and remain addicted after an issue has been treated and there are those who never get addicted and shuck the drug once the issue has been treated. </p>
<p>An interesting note is that research has not isolated a single valid marker for addiction. That means they cannot take an individual and test them for this marker to determine if they are addicted. The same can be said for a marker for vulnerability to addiction.</p>
<p>I can try to answer some questions if anyone has specific ones. There is so much to be said about addiction. I wasn't sure what to write, but I wanted to get something out there that would be read before it is drowned out by other responses so this is somewhat incomplete. In addition, if there are enough people interested I could get my professor who is an addictions expert in behavioral neuroscience to weigh in and perhaps even do an ama. Would need a lot of interest in that before I even asked though haha. Again, any questions just ask me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coming from the mobile video game industry, a lot of effort has gone into the study of what causes addiction without having to affect the addiction with foreign chemicals.</p>
<p>Findings typically go down the path of differences in how much people value short term benefit versus long term consequences.  Since individuals are all different, the key is to find mechanisms that help monetize the ones who overvalue the short term.  Creating ways to remove pressure/pinch points blocking someone from short-term fun is as effective as providing mechanisms to dose incremental amounts of fun/reward.</p>
<p>The Stanford marshmallow study is a good example of this... kids were offered one marshmallow now or wait and get two marshmallows.  Some kids saw the long term benefit of patience and valued long term benefit.  Others valued immediate gratification (and perhaps the minimal marginal benefit of the long term) and wanted their marshmallow now.</p>
<p>Addicts tend to be the ones who want one marshmallow now.  Addicts are also susceptible to negative reinforcement created when designers place a barrier (known as a pinch) between the player and their reward.  Those that are very impatient will spend money to avoid waiting or losing since these people value the positive feelings more than free players.</p>
<p>Games typically slowly dial up the amount of pain/pinching the longer the customer is engaged... this washes out the casual gamers over time and allows only highly dedicated (or highly spending) ones to remain.  Naturally the marginal benefit of spending also degrades over time as the &quot;highs&quot; of the game diminish, so game designers also have to keep finding ways to keep the game fun and fresh.</p>
<p>If the monetization loop is too aggressive then even the addict will flame out or realize something is wrong.  Just like in slot machines, the slow-drip cycle of a long bleed-out is critical to ensure addiction to the benefit of paying money without making the game feel like it's detrimental to the addict.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Struggling addict here. I'm seeing a lot of really great scientific explanations so I want to offer a more intuitive one. The less aversion you feel to the present moment, the less likely it is that you will feel the need to change your perception of that moment by ingesting substances. I commonly experience aversion in the form of anxiety. I drink because it relieves my social anxiety and the often concomitant self-consciousness by numbing me to whatever I feel. The self-consciousness is still there, I'm just less aware of it. The more secure I feel in a social situation the less I feel the urge to drink. I have found 3 tools that are actually working in my ongoing fight against addiction. They are 1) exercise. It's hard to feel anxious when you're tired/filled with yummy endorphins. 2) Forging good relationships by putting myself ever so slightly outside of my comfort zone. This can be dangerous because if I dive into a new situation without testing the waters I'm liable to freak out which seems to reinforce my aversion to said situations. 3) the most important tool for me has been meditation. It helps me relax as I understand more and more where my anxiety is coming from. It is a surprisingly physical shift when I meditate- I literally 'tense' my muscles like I'm flinching almost all the time, but it's subtle enough that I don't notice unless I direct my attention to the agitated muscles. Try it right now, is there any tension in your hands? Your shoulders? Your forehead/brow? Can you simply let go of it? Do you feel better after relieving yourself of the unnecessary tension? In the words of lennon/mccartney, can you manage to just, &quot;let it be?&quot; It really isn't some religious/ hippie bs, it's the real deal and I urge everyone to give it a shot. If you're skeptical or don't think you're capable of doing it.... there's only one way to find out ;D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a truly ELI5 comic, check out the [Rat Park study comic] (<a href="http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comics_en/rat-park/" target="_blank">http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comics_en/rat-park/</a>) based on Bruce Alexander's research.</p>
<p>There are a lot of answers proposing singular answers, but the full answer: it's complicated. Really fucking complicated.</p>
<p>Here are some factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetics, in combination with other vulnerabilities like life stressors or a difficult environment.</li>
<li>History of a mental illness. Now, the self-medication theory is often cited, but it doesn't really capture the entire story. Are there people who use substances to control things like low mood or anxiety? Absolutely. But, for example, there are higher rates of stimulant use (like cocaine) among people with certain anxiety disorders. Stimulants mimic anxiety. So what's going on? It's likely that the factors that increase vulnerability to a mental illness are also factors that increase vulnerability to a substance use problem. Another point: substances may be used to control side effects of psychiatric medications. Smoking rates are super high among people diagnosed with schizophrenia, at least partially because nicotine can moderate some side effects of antipsychotics.</li>
<li>Environment. This is truly under-appreciated in a lot of addictions research. If you have people exposed to violence, life disruptions, instability, uncertainty, etc. you can't blame them for trying to get by the best they can. (See the Rat Park comic to go a bit more in depth here.)</li>
<li>Poor coping skills/learned maladaptive coping skills. Living well and in balance is a skill that often needs to be learned and practised. Yet how many of us learn from a young age that a drink is a good way to deal with a bad day or a problem? A lot. It's so pervasive when you start to look for it. What are we <strong>not</strong> so often taught? How to cope with setbacks, how to tackle and solve problems, how to look at situations realistically, how to be assertive in our needs, how to take a breather, how to accept difficult (normal) emotions.</li>
