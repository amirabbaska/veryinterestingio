		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two separate small jets running parallel with each other produces a less chaotic flow of water than a single large jet. You can notice this in those elaborate fountain shows: each jet is actually a bundle of smaller jets that combine to form the big &quot;ribbon&quot; of water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In 1896, Halsey W. Taylor lost his father to an outbreak of typhoid fever caused by a contaminated water supply. This personal tragedy led the young Halsey Taylor to dedicate his life to providing a safe, sanitary drink of water in public places. … The historic Double Bubbler projector [spouter] was designed by Halsey Taylor himself, and still ranks as the most important innovation in the industry’s history. It projects two separate streams of water, which converge to provide an abundant `pyramid’ of water at the apex of the stream. This gives the user a fuller, more satisfying drink.”</p>
<p>The folks at Halsey Taylor are being polite here. What they mean is that the Double Bubbler enables you to take in more water and less air when you drink. As a result, you don’t burp. Think of all the delicate social negotiations you’ve been involved in that have gone awry because of an ill-timed eructation (that’s belch for you dropouts). Had you been drinking from a Double Bubbler, that fat contract (job, babe, whatever) might have been yours.</p>
<p>The Double Bubbler serves other purposes as well. You get less spraying, presumably because the water slows down when the two streams merge. The double streams also act as a sort of pressure regulator. If the water pressure is unusually strong one day, a single-stream fountain might give the unwary sipper a shot in the eye. When the twin streams of the Double Bubbler meet, however, their upward momentums tend to cancel out no matter how high the pressure gets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
