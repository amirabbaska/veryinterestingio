		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because sodium is the component of salt that has an effect on our health. Also, sodium is naturally occurring in foods when not in salt. So when a food has sodium but no salt it could be confusing since people would see 0% DV for salt but 60% or something for Sodium</p>
<p>Edit: I guess this is one way to more than double your karma</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sodium chloride is the major ingredient in what we know as &quot;table salt&quot;. There are other sodium salts, such as sodium iodide, which is added in small amounts to table salt, and sodium bicarbonate, known as baking soda. There are also non-sodium salts, such as potassium chloride, that contribute to the &quot;salty&quot; taste of foods. The word &quot;salt&quot; is simply too vague to list as a nutrient.</p>
<p>Here's an interesting salt product to consider: <a href="http://windsorsalt.com/products/half-salt/" target="_blank">Half Salt</a> contains 50% sodium chloride, 50% potassium chloride, and a trace of potassium iodide. It tastes similar to salt, but only contains half of the normal sodium compared to the same amount of table salt.</p>
<p>Edit: Half Salt is not for everyone. There are health warnings associated with it. Please consult your doctor before using this type of product. I brought it up as an example of a different salt product, but it is certainly not appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>Edit2: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eFBseD9.jpg" target="_blank">Here is an image of the Nutrition Facts and Health Warning found on the bottle of Half Salt.</a> &quot;For normal healthy people, not to be used by persons on sodium or potassium restricted diets unless approved by a physician.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemically, salt just means 'metal + non metal compound'. 'table salt' is <em>A</em> salt, specifically a sodium salt...but there are plenty of other salts around, so the term is far too generic to be used for nutritional information. Sodium Bicarbonate + Monosodium Glutamate are other sodium salts we use in cooking and such, just for example, which would show up as 'Sodium' content but you probably wouldn't refer to as 'Salt' </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Salt&quot; is ambiguous. Broadly, a salt is an ionic compound that can be formed by acid/base neutralization. </p>
<p>Na+ has the biggest effect of health compared to Cl- anions. So other sodium compounds also have the same effect. You wouldn't be getting the full picture if it just said &quot;Salt&quot; or &quot;Table Salt&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientifically speaking, &quot;salt&quot; is a very broad term. It's like saying  &quot;paint&quot;. What sort of paint? Gloss, matt, blue, green?</p>
<p>Salts can be made from many minerals/metals including sodium, potassium, chlorine etc BUT sodium is the most common mineral in salts that our bodies use as an electrolyte. (Chemical that help transmit electricity)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
