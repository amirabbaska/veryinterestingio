		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Separation of church and state is a shorthand phrase that we use. There's no law about it on the book. The law we do have is the First Amendment, which states that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot; Let's unpack that text. </p>
<p>First, the idea of establishment. In the 18th Century, establishment refers to the idea of the creation and promotion of a single church backed by the state and given special privileges. Most European countries had established churches (Catholicism in many of the continental countries, the Church of England in the British Isles, etc.). Most of the colonies had their own established churches as well and either supported them legally and financially or restricted other religious activity or both. Only a handful of the middle colonies (most prominently Pennsylvania) practiced religious freedom and disestablishment. </p>
<p>The First Amendment prohibited <em>Congress</em> from making laws about establishment to prevent the Federal government from establishing a single national religion at the expense of the religions practiced in the several states. Although they may seem to be mostly the same to us today, in contemporary practice, there were huge theological differences between the Anglicans in the South, the Catholics of Maryland, the Quakers of Pennsylvania, the Congregationalists and Puritans of New England and so on. The Amendment was designed to protect the rights of the several states to practice and support their own chosen religions. On the state level, there was no separation of church and state and there was never intended to be any. </p>
<p>Second, we have the issue of &quot;prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot;. This accomplishes a similar task to the first part of the amendment, and basically prevents Congress from outlawing or restricting the religious practices of certain groups or sects. It applies more to individuals than the things I talked about above and prevents Congress doing an end run around the states and abolishing certain practices of individual sects.</p>
<p>That's the Constitutional side of it, but that's not the whole issue. </p>
<p>As you can see, there prohibitions on government action are actually quite narrow. There's no prohibition on what government officers can say or do regarding religion in a private capacity. There's no restriction on how religious beliefs and practices can influence government policy except insofar as there is a prohibition on explicitly backing a single religious sect's practices and giving them the backing of the national government. For all of American history, religious beliefs have informed the creation of laws on both the national and the state level and most of the time most people have been generally okay with it.</p>
<p>America has always been a generally religious place and our traditions reflect that. You're asking about the use of the Bible and other religious symbols in the Presidential inauguration ceremony. There's no hard and fast rule — we do it because its tradition. In this case the tradition was established by George Washington. He swore the oath of office on a Bible because it was (and still is) common practice to swear oaths with one's hand on a Bible as a show of ones sincerity. It demonstrates that you believe that your promise will not only be enforced by the other people who witness it, but by God himself.</p>
<p>There's no reason why a President couldn't swear the oath without a Bible. In fact, several presidents have not. For instance, John Quincy Adams and Franklin Pierce both swore on a book of laws, symbolizing their allegiance to the Constitution above all else. </p>
<p>I'll stop there, since this is detailed enough. If you want, though, I can go into detail about the &quot;American Civil Religion&quot; — the historical and sociological idea that throughout American history we have been united by a quasi-religious faith in destiny of the United States and our place as God's chosen people. Hidden throughout American political rhetoric, writing, art, and history you can find glimpses of this civil faith — which coexists with and feeds off of sectarian faiths. For instance, every time you hear a President say &quot;And may God bless the United States of America&quot; they aren't making an appeal to a single sectarian God, but rather to the divine figure who serves as protector and guide of the United States in the ACR. The inauguration itself is a civil religious ceremony, with prayers, hymns, and other vestiges of a church service. It's all very fascinating, whether or not you believe in it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since the thread is locked for some reason, I'll answer you here /u/Hawke666. </p>
<p>I'm not clear on the particulars, but you are correct that since the founding, the establishment clause as well as other parts of the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the states as well as the federal government. Formal establishment of religion was done away with in the states by the mid-19th Century when the last states did away with the practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's clear up some misconceptions. This answer only applies to USA, and my source is that I'm a judicial clerk who has formally been sworn-in to serve the Constitution. I watch people get sworn in every day.</p>
<p>No one in any courtroom or public swearing-in must &quot;swear&quot; on a bible. </p>
<p>How oaths must be administered are usually codified in the revised code of each state (check yours if you're shockingly bored!). Nearly every oath-administration statute specifically holds that one may say &quot;I do affirm&quot; instead of &quot;I do swear&quot; and that you can substitute &quot;this you do as you shall answer under the pains and penalties of perjury&quot; instead of &quot;so help you God.&quot; Rarely is there any requirement to swear on anything at all, and never only a bible.</p>
<p>This is codified by law, and gives jurors/witnesses/public officials the choice.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, I've never seen a judge use a bible for swearing in. My judge, who is a religious man, doesn't even ask &quot;so help you God&quot; and asks if they &quot;swear or affirm&quot; by default. Also, nearly every judge takes a simple &quot;I do&quot; instead of the formal &quot;I do affirm.&quot; No one swears or affirms on anything - they just raise their right hands.</p>
<p>As far as presidential inagurations are concerned - again there's the choice to do so. George Washington set the tradition by swearing on a bible (and the origin for the legality of a public official doing this is rooted in &quot;tradition&quot;). John Q. Adams, on the other hand, swore on a book of law (as did I). </p>
<p>The more direct and controversial question is: why do we even allow the choice of swearing-in on religious objects or with religious undertones? The Constitutional answer is likely that it's a harmless tradition dating back hundreds of years into our British ancestry and that a neutral option must be provided by law. It's understood that public servants must serve the public (duh), but they don't magically have their religion removed from their bodies when they become a government official. They swear, specifically, to serve the public and swearing on their religious text doesn't change the words of the oath but intensifies the meaning of the oath by staking THEIR IMMORTAL SOUL on serving the public. But really it's just window-dressing formality with enough tradition behind it to sneak under the Constitutional rigors of the Establishment Clause. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As one of the other respondents mentioned, almost all of the original colonies were religious states.  The New England colonies were Congregationalist/Puritan, the Southern colonies were Anglican, Maryland was Catholic.  You could be exiled or jailed for having dissenting religious views.  Only Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Rhode Island (off the top of my head) had anything close to what we consider religious freedom, and they were all founded by <em>people like the</em> Quakers who have a strong doctrine of people being free to follow &quot;the light within&quot; and Baptist who have strong thoughts about only having believers in church.  </p>
<p>Separation of church and state in the federal government was pushed through by the leading cultural elites like Thomas Jefferson, who were deists or otherwise non-conforming religiously, and the evangelical revivalists, like the Baptist and the Methodists, who wanted to be able to proselytize in other colonies without fear of being imprisoned for it.  </p>
<p>Even though that was accepted, <em>all of the colonies with religious laws kept those laws</em>.  Depending on how you want to count things, the last state to disestablish religion was either Massachusetts (people required to attend parish churches until 1834), North Carolina (only Christians can hold office until 1876), or Utah (admitted to the union as a state in 1896 on the condition of not being a theocracy anymore).  </p>
<p>Source:  am American religions prof.</p>
<p>Further info:  the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/view/" target="_blank">PBS documentary &quot;God in America&quot;</a> does a great job of explaining this and streams free online.</p>
<p>ETA:  some folks are complaining that this still doesn't answer the question.  Let me flesh this out a bit more.  You have a society based on British culture with an established religion in the early America.  The Brits swear on the Bible, so we do too.  With established religion and the super-traditionalism of the courts, there's NO way that's going to change.  And state-established religion lasted a lot longer then most people think it did.  In the super-traditional world of the courts (where you can still get kicked out for not wearing a suit and such), that's not very long ago at all.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  Yes, I fucked up by saying the Middle colonies were mostly Quaker.  I haven't had my second cup of coffee yet, thank you for notifying me.  I fixed it.</p>
<p>Edit 3:  GOLD?  Wow!  Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Separation of Church and State means that the government cannot prohibit the religious activity of a person, or require it. But it does not mean that religious actions cannot be involved. We require people to swear an oath, and for most people that is a religious action. As such they have the right to swear upon any religious text. They also have the right to swear upon any book of US law, a copy of the constitution, or any other document they find significant enough to give weight to their oath. </p>
<p>Edit: I left out the option to Affirm Intent which the non-religious can use as well. This is the same legal binding of an Oath with none of the religious overtones. I added this further in the thread chain but many keep reminding me here so I am putting in the edit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a tradition, not a requirement to swear on the bible. It's just symbolic of your sincerity to swear upon a symbol of something you truly care about. As an example, Rep. Keith Ellison swore in on on the Quran, his book of faith.</p>
<p>We're basically taking you at face value that you are so dedicated to your word that you would swear to it while holding your most prized possession.</p>
<p>The important thing actually isn't the book. Even if books were of no importance to you, you must still swear to uphold yourself within the confines of the constitution. Should you go out of bounds of your duty, you can be impeached, regardless of what you swore on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
