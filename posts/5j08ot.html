<p>Foaming agents are added to soaps as a marketing strategy, as people erroneously believe that bubbles are more than just air pockets and actually have an effect on how clean things get. </p>
<p>Bubbles can serve as a sort of indicator of the concentration of soap in the water, which does effect how clean stuff gets. However this is only a rough indicator, and isn't really reliable.
Beyond that, there's really no correlation between bubbles and how clean anything gets.</p>
<p>As an example compare dish soap and dishwasher detergent. Both  are surfectants designed to do the same job. Dish soap has bubbles, thanks to the added foaming agents, and dishwasher detergent doesn't. Both get your dishes clean equally well (assuming correct use) proving that the bubbles really don't have any impact on cleanliness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in how soaps actually get things clean, you should look up information about amphipathic molecules and Van der Waals forces. The short story is that molecules of a similar polarity solubilize with one another, i.e. water based things mix with water and oil based things with oil. Soap is amphipathic, which means one part of the molecule is polar (solubilizes things like water based molecules) and the other is non-polar (like oil). So you have a bunch of greasy dishes and you want your running water to get it clean-hopeless. Add some soap and it will bind to the grease and the running water, taking it all down the sink.</p>
<p>Tl;dr soap dissolves fats and still mixes with water to clean stuff</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do not.</p>
<p>HOWEVER. It can be an indication of how clean something is, because bubbling soap that has bonded to a particle of dirt etc will not become a bubble.</p>
<p>So, if you're using shampoo in the shower and you don't see bubbles, you're not using enough, and there might not be enough soap to bond with all of the dirt, and you won't get 100% clean. If you see a whole ton of bubbles though, then you're using too much.</p>
<p>Aka, bubbles are essentially wasted soap. But at least you know you're clean when you see them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemical engineer here. Common sense is that soap is a mere fatty substances remover. However, soaps (surfactants) have also the ability to clean dust or any other solid particles. According to interface thermodynamics [ask for the source if you are really interested] small powders tend to prefer being on the water-air interface, especially when water has a surfactant. However, suds are actually air-water-water-air interfaces, making it a more stable place for particles to locate during a cleanup process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recall being told in high school that bubbles have no correlation with cleaning, in the sense that we're now able to manufacture cleaning agents that clean just as well with less suds, but since we've always associated soap and suds/bubbles it leads to consumer belief it isn't cleaning well, so they just let it bubble... </p>
<p>Although this is something that I don't remember well and I'd prefer someone with more expertise to weigh in here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
