		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Population is always growing, barring some horrible catastrophe or war. Therefore, economic output must also increase in order to create the jobs, and goods, all those new people need. This is true just about everywhere.</p>
<p>2) The value of money is almost always inflating, so people need corresponding wage increases in order to continue to afford to live. As wages stagnate and prices continue to grow, eventually people can't afford to pay for everything they need, such as rent/mortgages, food, gas, cloths, etc. Constant economic growth makes businesses more money, which results in them paying their employees more. (In before some socialist comes and rants at me about growing wage gaps or whatever. This is an economic principle, and yelling at me won't change that)</p>
<p>3) If the economy isn't growing, then it's shrinking. This translates to businesses shutting down, people losing their jobs, and less tax revenue for the government. Each of these things results in, in order; fewer goods for sale, resulting in higher prices; fewer people with money to spend, resulting in even more businesses closing; and the reduction of government programs, which means more people without jobs. Combine these problems with either of the previous examples and you have a recipe for massive unemployment, exorbitant prices, and a bankrupt government that continues to spiral downwards until the country collapses. </p>
<p>TL;DR, An economy that isn't growing is like a body that can't make new cells. You'll be dead in a week. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These people are literally all wrong.  The real answer depends what level you're referring to.  If you're talking a global scale, it's because of the increase in technology and the decrease of inefficiency in the market. Tech increase means any advancement that increases real output, such as a better way to farm or a way to make better houses. Decrease in market inefficiency are things such as removing minimum wages, tariffs, etc. Note, these things may lead to a worse economy in one country, but the global economy as a whole will constantly grow.  People saying bullshit about capitalism and unsustainable growth are completely misinterpreting Marx.</p>
<p>If you're referring to an individual country level, then growth occurs due to the things mentioned above, but also at the expense of other countries. This much is self explanatory.</p>
<p>The reason the economy shrinking is bad is because technology is always increasing such that real output of the entire global system is always increasing. If one country is sitting there and staying flat or shrinking, that means it is losing relative economic strength compared to other countries. </p>
<p>This tends to have a compounding effect as the country is forced to do things that cause the economy to become even weaker. An example is minimum wage. If the US wasn't hemorrhaging high skilled labor (such as techs at a chip fabrication plant) then the US may not need to have to increase its minimum wage to bring the lowest standard deviation of the population to livable wages. But alas the US is shitting jobs like mad and Walmart workers get paid scraps so the US has to introduce heavy inefficiency to the system by raising the minimum wage.  </p>
<p>Edit: Please note I'm being 100% serious about everyone else saying a load of bullshit. Money doesn't inflate for fun. It can deflate just as easily if you feel like making it that way, a la bitcoin. Saying money magically decreases in value just for the sake of it is not real economics. There has to be some kind of underlying reason, as money is not some kind of natural force of the physical world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there is population growth, and because people expect their standard of living to improve over time.</p>
<p>An economy has only so much wealth in it, and that wealth is distributed amongst everyone in it.  If you have new people, you need more stuff, or everyone has to do with less.</p>
<p>In addition, we are always coming up with new ways to make life better.  Those things aren't free.  If everyone wants a car and air conditioning and internet and smartphones and MRI machines, we need economic growth to pay for those things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The underlying thing people are worried about is: &quot;How much stuff can the average person buy?&quot; This goes down if the economy has negative growth (recession) assuming population has stayed the same/increased. Population usually grows, so a stagnating economy usually means that the average person can't buy as much stuff because there are more people who have to share the same sized pie as before. Growth is good provided it out paces population, and inflation. But even when it doesn't, it is still better than a stagnant or shrinking economy. </p>
<p>Is it sustainable? Yes and no. The factors that affect economic growth form an extensive list. Some big ones are: Population, availability of resources, technology, and availability of captial (sort of a resource). Population tends to go up, more people means more workers, so more work tends to get done. Population also increased demand which drives growth as well. Availability of resources is a funny one, because we use the resources over time, but technology can make resources like deep sea oil available when they previously weren't. Theoretically technology always goes forward unless something catastrophic happens so that is one factor that drives growth continuously by improving out productivity. Availability of capital (Savings) determines whether businesses can start or grow to replace those that shrink and fail, lots of capital allows you to replace shrinking/dead businesses and expand. So yes, it is sustainable if technology can keep improving fast enough to make additional resources available as we consume the ones we already have. That is a big if though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There doesn't always have to be economic growth.  There often isn't.  That's what a recession is.</p>
<p>But, economic growth is literally the process of life getting better.  It's a measurement of the value of everything created and every service performed.  If the economy is growing, then more of people's needs, wants, and desires are being met than before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
