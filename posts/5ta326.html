		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to have to come at this from the other angle:</p>
<p>The reason that poor people tend to get screwed by the Legal System is because they are saddled with a Public Defender. </p>
<p>Public Defenders aren't bad Lawyers, they're usually <em>shockingly</em> competent at their jobs. <em>However</em>, due to their small numbers, Public Defenders are required to take on an <em>insane</em> number of cases. Public Defenders <em>usually</em> don't have much time to prepare for a case. Most can't afford to spend more than 15 minutes on a single case, and are <em>insanely lucky</em> if they can afford an hour of preparation for a single case. </p>
<p>It's virtually impossible to win a case without time to prepare. You need to research the relevant Laws, and <strong>all</strong> of the Case Law that is binding in your Jurisdiction. Then you need to review the Prosecution's Evidence, and get Evidence that was illegally acquired or questionable thrown out. You also need time to coach your client on how they should behave in court.</p>
<p>It's <em>physically impossible</em> to accomplish <strong>half</strong> of the preparations required in an hour, much less 15 minutes. As a result, most Public Defenders recommend that <em>most</em> of their Clients just take whatever plea-deal is offered by the Prosecution. It'll be a lighter punishment than they'd receive if they go to court and lose, and the odds of not losing are <em>basically zero</em>.</p>
<p>The exception to that <em>most</em> are clients who <em>can</em> realistically be defended. This generally means that the Case against the Client is full of holes to the point where the <em>Jury Members</em> would probably catch the procedural errors, or relies upon evidence that's <em>blatantly</em> inadmissible in court.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Wealthy People can afford to hire a Private Lawyer. These Lawyers can control their case-load, ensuring that they have <strong>all</strong> the Preparation Time that they need. They can take their time, do their research, coach their client, and pick apart the Prosecution's case.</p>
<p>Even if the client is blatantly guilty, the Lawyer can actually hold the Court to the Letter of the Law regarding sentences... but this is going to require some explanation.</p>
<p>Most Judges in the United States, outside of the Federal Circuits, are <em>elected</em>. Because of our current culture, it's best for a Judge to maintain a public image of being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; If you pass down a relatively light sentence on someone, you can bet your ass that your Opponent in the next election will plaster it all over their campaign ads. As a result, Judges are incentivized to be as harsh as possible when it comes to sentencing.</p>
<p>This trickles up to the Federal Circuit as well. Federal Judges are generally drawn from State Judges, and getting promoted up in the Federal Circuits requires you to be Nominated to that position by the President of the United States. <em>Being</em> a Candidate for a Federal Bench (which you can hold for life) requires you to hold onto your State Bench. Moving up in the Federal Circuits requires the President to move you up... and the President has incentives to put Judges that are &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; onto the Federal Benches.</p>
<p>However, a Good Lawyer can hold a Judge's feet to the fire when it comes to sentencing. Excessive Sentences can be used as a justification for Appeals, and having your judgements <em>overturned</em> by a higher court hurts your chances for advancement <strong>even more</strong> than not being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; A State Judge up for re-election can spin not being &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; as being &quot;Merciful,&quot; but it's difficult to spin &quot;Incompetent Judge's Decision Overturned by Appellate Court&quot; into something vaguely positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that the letter of the law allows more lenient sentences, or lesser charges, or other mechanisms that allow a person to receive a preferable sentence.  A good lawyer is better at convincing a prosector or judge or jury that those mechanisms should be used to the benefit of their client.  That's what makes them a good lawyer. </p>
<p>Additionally, rich and famous people often have options less well off people don't.  A prosecutor might be willing, for example, to let a famous person off with &quot;community service&quot; because they think kids will actually listen to them and not, say, do drugs if they go around telling people not to, something that wouldn't be true of your average accused. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lawyer is there to be a pain.  Against a public defender who can't really dedicate the time to a young delinquent from a poor family, it's an easy slam dunk to convict them and throw some years at them.  Easy win, get the stat.</p>
<p>With a PITA wealthy lawyer, expect extensive attention and appeals and calling the judge and prosecutor into question.  Bad stats, waste of resources, risk of being overturned on appeal.  </p>
<p>It's just human nature to go down the path of least resistance.  Especially if the people are represented by politically-minded workers.  The lawyers need to become judges, judges need higher court and eventually maybe Justice.  The consistent, &quot;tough on crime&quot; stats makes picking on the poor way easier than going after the rich.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do believe that the US legal system is flawed and rich people do get off a lot easier than the average Joe. </p>
<p>But... with that being said, some average Joe's are just lucky when it comes to legal matters or they're masters at getting sympathy from court judges. </p>
<p>My brother is a piece of shit wife/kid beater and he ALWAYS seems to get off easy. He's broke as shit and usually drunk and usually unemployed. Whenever he gets arrested, and he has been arrested at least 4 times now (that I know of) its usually for beating his wife or fighting with neighbors/strangers or some other gang related shit, at least 1 weapons charge. Either way, the most jail time he has gotten was 3 months, 3 glorious drama free months. Then business as usual when he gets out.</p>
<p>Once he and his wife apparently got pulled over for driving erratically (he was drunk) and the cop gave him a stern lecture and asked his sober wife to drive instead than sent them on their way. Oh his kids were in the car. Good times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
