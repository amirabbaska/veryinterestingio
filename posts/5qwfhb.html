		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me preface this question by saying I have always been a firm believer of evolution. However, I've puzzled over many strange results of evolution and how they got to be where they are. Carnivorous plants are one example. How can a plant GRADUALLY evolve the ability to trap insects and absorb them without use of its roots? Did it just start out as a mutation that made a plant kind of sticky? It seems like such a radical change and the intermediate steps don't necessarily seem beneficial enough to ensure greater than average reproductive success.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for all your informative responses! This was my first reddit post since the 4 years I've been lurking, and it is very encouraging.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These plants are usually found in regions with poor soil quality meaning that they may only receive vital nutritients when animals die around them. They could hav evolved to simply inhibit  the movement  of insects with a sticky surface and gradually moved toward movement themselves. Once movement was common, natural selection picked the most efficient animal. Ones with the best energy efficiency survive and yield todays carniverous plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Berkeley graduate (don't remember her name) did a presentation on carnivorous plants at a meet a few years ago. The carnivorous trait did not happen at a single event, but rather occurred multiple times. Theory for enzymes: plants needed to develop chitinase and proteases to destroy fungus pathogens from invading their tissue. The enzymes and the glands producing them ended up being used in carnivorous plants to breakdown insect exoskeletons.</p>
<p>The viscous liquid in certain Nepenthes species are nearly identical to the mucilage of drosera, iirc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most plants are capable of absorbing at least some nutrients through their leaves, which is why foliar feeding works. There are also many plants that evolved the ability to stick insects to them as a defense mechanism, and in areas with low nutrient levels such as sphagnum bogs or up in trees the plants that were able to trap and absorb insects most efficiently survived very well compared to their cousins who could not.</p>
<p>This is why carnivorous behavior has evolved in several different kinds of plants that are not that closely related to each other, such as Cephalotus and Nepenthes looking very similar despite not being related, Pinguicula using a similar mechanism to Drosera, and Byblis, and so on. There's even an orchid that's debateably carnivorous, but it needs more study to confirm or deny this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing you have to remember is that the &quot;adaptation&quot; is what causes the advantage, unlike Lamar's theory. </p>
<p>The ancestor of the Venus flytrap was probably a plant like any other, but down the line one of it developed a sticky substance around her &quot;flower&quot;, by a conjunct of &quot;random mutations&quot;. Some did something similar, but one that wasn't too sticky let the fly flew away, other was too sticky, and not even one fly got away, preventing it from polimerazing. Others had leaves that close when touched, something other plants can do actually, and when a fly was trapped by this it died and feed the plant. With the past of time, whatever change was tested, and the &quot;better suited&quot; (wrote on the broad spectrum) had descendants that could have a new change. This is a very simplistic explanation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
