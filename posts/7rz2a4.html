<p>Any ideas why a petite woman would get the same dosage as Terry Crews?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because biology is complicated, and going by weight isn't that much more accurate.  </p>
<p>Let's say Terry Crews's body is twice the weight of your typical Olsen twin's.  Is his brain?  His liver?  His thyroid gland?  Is the drug used throughout his body, or is it simply triggering a response, and beyond a certain amount doesn't matter?  What if the twin started porking out until she weighed the same as Terry?  Her organs didn't suddenly get bigger.  What kind of math would you have to use to take all these factors into account?</p>
<p>Instead, drug manufacturers play it safe and give the appropriate dosage for a small adult.  They will let doctors and patients assume any risk of increasing that dose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most meds are dosed by weight in kids, but some are dosed by age. OTC meds tend to have less side effects than prescription meds and a wider margin of error, so it is less dangerous to do age-based dosing than weight-based dosing. Age-based dosing is more convenient as it uses a number that only changes once per year and does not require any special equipment to measure. </p>
<p>In adults most meds are studied by doing preliminary testing to estimate the minimum dose needed to reach a therapeutic effect in the average person and the maximum safe dose than can be given to the average person. Then it is studied at various doses between these two values to determine what doses they actually want to manufacture. For most meds this is sufficient without specifically accounting for weight, so they are not dosed based on weight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Their weight may change significantly over the course of a few months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do this under the assumption that at least some people will make calculation errors if they tried to administer something based on mgs per lb/kg. Itâ€™s safer for OTC meds to have a generic dosage based on age instead. Most prescription and IV meds administered are based on weight though, but nurses/doctors/etc. are trained on it and there are usually redundant checks (doctor, pharmacy, and nurse all check the dosage) to prevent errors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
