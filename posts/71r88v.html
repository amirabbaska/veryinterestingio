		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lens for near vision has the shape of a slice taken off a sphere, like the blue part in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Spherical_cap_diagram.tiff/lossless-page1-1011px-Spherical_cap_diagram.tiff.png" target="_blank">this</a> image. The size of the sphere depends on how good your eyes are: The worse your sight, the smaller the sphere needs to be. But whether you wear eyeglasses or contacts, you need lenses made from the same sphere. The thickness of the slice however will increase if you need a larger lens.</p>
<p>Of course, lenses aren't really made out of a whole glass sphere, even though their pricetag might suggest that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason is that the &quot;Coke bottle&quot; lens are either thick on the edges for nearsightedness, or thick in the middle for those people who are farsighted is because of the size of the lens. Either way, its because an eyeglass lenses is much much larger than a contact that makes the eyeglass lens thick. The prescription strength comes from the difference between the front curve and the back curve of the lens, whether its a contact or eyeglass lens.  In the center of the lenses you can make the lens as thin as you want, although Federal regulations say 2.2 mm for safety reasons. (or a minimum 1.8 mm on the edge for farsighted people.) For example, a nearsighted person has a much sharper curve on the back of the lens than the front. So the further away from the center you get, the thicker the lens becomes. Far sighted people the opposite occurs, but then the optician will try to get the minimum edge thickness to as close to 1.8 mm as possible. Any thinner and you risk the lens chipping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a magnifying glass, to get the light condensed enough to start a fire you have to be pretty close to the object. If you had a magnifying glass twice as big you could be twice as far, however this only explains the reason glasses are wider than contacts, not thicker.</p>
<p>Glasses technically can be as thin as contacts, but there are two reasons why they are commonly not. First of all, imagine if your glasses were almost as thin as a hair, and they were still as wide as your current glasses. They would be very fragile. Secondly, Thinner glass would absorb much less light. There are actually many types of glass used for glasses, sometimes even plastic. Higher quality glasses can be much thinner in the lens and manage to capture the same amount of light, while others are much more durable.</p>
<p>In short, the worst your vision, the more light you need focused into your eyes. The only two ways to increase the light your eyes receive is by making the glasses thicker, wider, or increasing the quality of the glass your glasses use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glasses lenses are farther from your eye and the prescription for them describe the strength of the lens needed to correct your vision while located away from your eyes. Contact lens prescriptions describe a corrective strength and also the size and shape of the lens. Because it doesnt sit in front of your eye, but on top of it, it doesnt need to be as thick. Lenses do get thicker as a prescription increases but not as noticibly as glasses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
