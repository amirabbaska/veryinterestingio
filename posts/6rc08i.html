<p>If an anomaly gives some kind advantage (specifically, an advantage that leads to more offspring) it can be passed down.  On a long enough timeline, those members of a species with the advantage will out-reproduce those without it.</p>
<p>If an anomaly does not give any advantage, or provides a disadvantage, it will likely disappear over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question isn't clear.  I think you mean to distinguish between a trait &quot;selected for&quot;, and a trait that results from a genetic anomaly (because evolution itself doesn't exclude anomalies definitionally).  And I'm not sure what you mean by genetic anomaly either.  Are you referring to genes that become established through genetic drift?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are on the verge of coming to a deeper understanding of valuative judgements. Valuative judgements are always made by a <em>person</em> about something in a <em>specific context</em>.  </p>
<p>There are no non-contextual valuations of genetic change/speciation that occur naturally.  Even mutations which induce death may be better <strong>than the alternative</strong> in the appropriate context.  </p>
<p>Evolution is similarly not a process that makes organisms <em>better</em> instead it selects organisms that are suited for an ecology, or more accurately is the name we give to the process which describe those specific living organisms which flourish in a specific environment at a specific point in time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General: Biology is about things that live in an environment. We make models (like genetic models) to help us understand a factor (like what proteins a gene produces) among many other factors. The distinction between what you call a genetic anomaly (bad/neutral) and evolutionary trait (good) cannot be modeled accurately with only a genetic model. You need to put your genetic model back into the organism and put the organism back into the environment to understand if the trait is helping the organism or not. </p>
<p>With an example:</p>
<p>I'm interpreting your question as: Why are some heritable traits considered good while others are considered neutral or bad? </p>
<p>To answer that I'll use a common example in human genetics: sickle cell anemia. Is sickle cell anemia good trait or a bad trait which we should seek to cure? To answer that we have to think about the environment that the organism with sickle cell anemia is in and ask &quot;Does this trait help, hinder, or have no effect on the survival of the organism?&quot; and then ask the same question about reproductive fitness, group fitness (if it applies) etc. for all the factors you want to think about. More factors controlled means a better model, but also a harder model to understand. (Side note: This is exactly why I love biology so much, the variable difficulty related to scale.)</p>
<p>Back to sickle cell, in equatorial Africa, where there are mosquitos that carry Malaria, sickle cell's down sides (pain, bacteria infection, shortened lifespan) are worth it. This is because sickle cell staves off Malaria which is much more likely to kill the organism before it can reproduce. </p>
<p>In Kansas though, sickle cell is all downside. You're in pain and die younger with no trade off for  increased reproductive fitness or quality of life because there's no Malaria to protect you from. </p>
<p>So is sickle cell a disease or a beneficial trait? As with most biology, the answer can be changed when you change the factors of your model. Change the location factor to Kansas and it's bad, change it to Kenya and it's good. So you have to remember to put your understanding of genetics back into the organism and then put the organism back in it's environment to really know why something is good, bad or neutral. </p>
<p>I think a good biologist seeks to understand the composition of an organism as well as the context of the organism. You cannot understand why something has a certain composition without understanding it's context. (Why does this organism have a protein that resists heat so well? Well because we found it in a hot spring!) </p>
<p>I hope this was all clear and helpful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may help to distinguish between what is <strong>adaptive</strong> and what is an <strong>adaptation</strong>.</p>
<p>A trait (or genetic variant) is <strong>adaptive</strong> if it contributes toward the reproductive success of an individual or lineage that carries it. As has been pointed out by other commenters, this depends on circumstances; what's adaptive under one set of conditions doesn't have to be adaptive elsewhere. A trait can exist simply as selectively neutral variation in a population for ages, until something changes and suddenly individuals that happen to carry the trait become evolutionary winners.</p>
<p>An <strong>adaptation</strong> is something that developed as a result of selection - in other words, it developed not randomly, but <em>because it was adaptive</em>. No trait can <em>start out</em> as an adaptation; ultimately, variation comes from random genetic processes like mutation and migration. However, mutations that contribute toward a certain trait - say, a long tail - can accumulate over time in a population, for as long as having a long tail helps you survive or reproduce. The long tails that these animals end up having, then, are an adaptation. (We can even consider a trait that results from a single mutation as an adaptation, because it eventually spread to the entire population, even if it originally arose by chance in a single individual. But then we need pretty good evidence that it was indeed adaptive; even completely meaningless genetic variants can still spread to the whole population.)</p>
<p>These are orthogonal concepts; they can occur in all combinations. Our DNA is full of bits of old viruses and other junk that (at the moment) does nothing important or useful: these are neither adaptive nor an adaptation. A mole's forepaws are an adaptation to a digging lifestyle, and are very adaptive to boot, because moles still dig a whole lot. A whale's (vestigial) pelvic bones are an adaptation to walking on four legs, but they're no longer adaptive, because whales no longer have hind legs. And so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
