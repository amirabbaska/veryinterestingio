	<title>Theoretically if there were 6 black holes making a cube shape that blocked off all entrances and you went into the empty space between the black holes (without getting sucked in) what would happen to space and time around you and outside of the theoretical black hole cube?</title>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So im a little late. All these answers here are not very satisfactory. You can in fact have a region of space that is blocked off from the rest of the universe due to a lattice of black holes surrounding the region. One of my friends phd thesis was on this exact topic. And heres one of the papers that describes this. The phenomenon is called &quot;piecewise silence&quot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3201" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3201</a></p>
<p>Basically what you get is a region of space that is distinct from the outside universe, and evolves completely independently. Its as if there were a smaller isolated universe inside the lattice of black holes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
