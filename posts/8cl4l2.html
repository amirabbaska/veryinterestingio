		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that you cannot send information to the past (aka receive information from the future) with delayed choice because the waveform interference pattern cannot be understood with the screen alone because you need to first examine the detectors to make sense of the dots on the screen.</p>
<p>The current thinking seems to be that you cannot send information across time because in the scrambling &quot;eraser&quot; section of the experiment, we send photons through a beam splitter which results in 50% landing in detectors C and the other 50% in detector D. Due to the fact their interference patterns subsequently are perfectly out of phase, you cannot decipher waveforms with the screen alone because without being able to reference the information in the detectors, the screen alone just looks like a bunch of unorganized dots with no apparent interference pattern.</p>
<p>However, is there a beam splitter available to science which could send most of the photons to one of the two detectors (for example, 99% go to detector C once they are in the eraser portion of the experiment).</p>
<p>It would seem to me that if there's a beam splitter than can send most of the photons just to detector C (99% instead of 50%), you would pretty clearly be able to see either a waveform or not, despite a little bit of fuzziness.</p>
<p>This idea also seems like it would not violate nature's rules about not having certainty about path information to get the waveform interference pattern.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Then you just have an almost totally unorganized blur for your C post selections, and basically a blank screen for your D post selections.  The photons state is a 50-50 superposition for the two patterns (fringe/antifringe), the BS doesn't assign the state, just sorts (trasmits or reflects) based on it/in proportion to its weight.  So, any BS which transmits not 50-50 will be sending a mixture of countervailing patterns to at least 1 detector, which washes out the interference an increasing amount as it approaches 100-0.  Maybe easier to see if you instead ask: why can't the DCQE use just 3 detectors (replace C with a mirror aimed at D) and concentrate all the erased paths on 1 location?  Because then the photons aren't spatially sorted by patterns at all and the setup is self defeating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's the way to think about it: the initial &quot;interference&quot; screen as labeled in the video on Earth always shows a non-interference blob. You will never directly see an interference pattern here. It will always show this blob no matter what happens to the twins later on on Mars. </p>
<p>Think about why this is true: you may not have detectors A or B on Mars, or you may not have the &quot;erasing&quot; detectors C or D on Mars, or you lie about the decision you're going to make to the Earth researcher, or the Mars lab blows up and there are no detectors and the twin photons go into the great infinity, etc.</p>
<p>Your mistake is assuming that messing with the Martian twins can cause an interference pattern on the screen on Earth, and that will never happen.</p>
<p>Instead, as you give Mars detector C more and more of the photons that were originally split 50-50, you in effect give more of the complementary pattern that D had to C. You aren't reinforcing C's interference pattern (remember it maps to a blob on Earth), but ruining it by combining D's. So as you get closer and closer to giving 100% to C, you in effect are making C responsible for the big blob of photons seen at the Earth &quot;interference&quot; screen.</p>
<p>Because what happens at the end is you classically communicate (not FTL) with the station on Mars what actually happened to the twins. In essence, you get to evaluate which photon at the Earth interference screen is correlated with which detector hit on Mars. And Mars can tell you that all 100% detector hits were due to C, and thus you label every photon on Earth's blobby interference screen as due to C.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
