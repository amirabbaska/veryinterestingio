		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, our memory space is finite. It would take a long time and a lot of information to fill it up though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain's memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes)</p>
<p>*... if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television, 2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years to use up all that storage.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In one sense, yes. Memory depends on forming new neural connections, and the brain has a finite number of neurones and a limited space in which to add more connections between them. Yet in another sense a healthy brain can never stop learning.</p>
<p>There is really no such thing as ‘a memory’. When we remember a fact or an event that happened to us, many networks of interconnected cells are involved. Sometimes, if we can’t remember an event one way, we can bring it to mind another way using different connections.</p>
<p>As we age, and have more and more to remember, the connections get more complex. When our brains are overloaded the same neurones are used in multiple memories in very flexible ways. So we might become more likely to confuse events, or have other difficulties in remembering, but we can’t really say that we ‘run out of memory’.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The brain is contained in a finite space so most physicists would say it must contain finite information. But really, the limiting factor is the amount of information the brain actually stores. I don't think it's possible to actually have an opportunity to fill the brain up.</p>
<p>The brain naturally abstracts and forms new memories using old memories as a basis. You can't sit down and just memorize pages of unique information like random numbers. The brain will fight you the whole way on such a task. Normally, you remember enough to reconstruct a kind of accurate repesentation of your so-called memories and not much more. Of course you do this by relating current events to other things you've experienced. So when faced with the task of memorizing tons of unique information, the sort which might fill a hard drive, it's basically impossible.</p>
<p>I think it's silly how people try to quantify the brain's information capacity. We don't even know how memory works. One thing is certain--the magic storage number is not the number of synaptic connections in a brain. Information is also stored in chemical distributions, receptor densities, and probably a myriad things we don't even know about. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Thing with me is that, I am smart and I'm self smarted basically, by myself. Basically from nature and smokin' drugs and doin different things I was self uhh..... self learned myself. And thats the whole difference I guess, is that I dont need the books, the schooling type things. I just get everything on my own. Because of that, I'm alive right now. I mean, if I read more books or tried to go onto collage or doin things like that, I'd be dead right now, because people say books and collage are for to make you smarter but they can also be for to get you dead. Which is what could happen to me! My brain doesn't use enough oxygen cause I dont have the whole thing filled with the different stuff. If it was full, it's only part full, and thats why I'm alive right now. The guards are in here like, here read this book, try to get smarter, I'm like, alright I'll pretend to read it but I'm not gonna really read it, cause then my brain would get more full, if I have another heart attack, I'm gonna die!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
