		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple. Advertisers pay money to Google/Youtube for the rights to show an advertisement before (or during) a video. Google/Youtube takes a cut of the revenue, and the Youtuber earns the rest.</p>
<p>The amount advertisers are willing to pay in terms of cost per click or cost per view, is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The popularity of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>The target audience of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>How competitive (from an advertiser perspective) the video is (or its associated keywords are)</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain videos are not eligible for monetization (so Youtubers typically won't earn ad revenue from them). This includes, for example, many videos depicting nudity or sex and videos containing extremely foul language or controversial / offensive topics.</p>
<p>If a video contains commercial music, sometimes the music publisher or record label will file a copyright claim over the video and instead of taking it down will request the Youtuber's revenue share instead. So, in these cases, the Youtuber is not penalized but also does not earn ad revenue from the video.</p>
<p>Youtubers also make lots of money (much more than standard ad revenue) by negotiating product placement deals directly with advertisers to personally use and/or promote a product (such as a mobile app, web service, gadget, etc.) within their video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is a popular YouTube creator (currently between 150k-250k subscribers). There are three core ways YouTubers make money. </p>
<p>(1.) YouTube AdSense: </p>
<ul>
<li>This is purely getting paid for views on videos, because there are ads on videos, such as display ads (the ads next to the video), overlay ads (ads that pop up at the bottom on the videos), and skippable and non-skippable video ads before the actual content. Depending on the time of the year, the amount a creator is making is roughly between $1 to $2 per 1,000 views. YouTube does this because they are getting a cut of the revenues that the advertiser is paying for on the videos. Some videos are not &quot;monetizable&quot;, so the creator will not earn anything for the views. This is generally because of offensive content within the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Sponsored Content:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is advertising within the video itself. This form of advertising can occur in many different forms, but a few examples would include companies paying for their products to be featured in videos, merely having the products mentioned in a video, or saying something along the line of &quot;this video is brought to you by [XYZ Company].&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) Selling Branded Products:</p>
<ul>
<li>This one is pretty obvious. Selling t-shirts, stickers, hats, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>My girlfriend is only involved in (1.) &amp; (2.) at the moment, and she made ~$50k in 2016. Each community within YouTube is different, but in her sphere, the majority of earnings come from sponsored content with AdSense being a nice bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ad makers pay YouTube to put their ads on YouTube videos. YouTube keeps a portion of that money (around 30% I think) and then pays the youtuber based on how many views they get. For a non-partnered youtuber, it's about 10 views for 1 cent, 100 views for 10 cents, 1,000 views for $1, and $2,000 for 1 million views (these are all estimates, it varies a lot). I'm not sure how different it is for partnered YouTubers, but I think it depends more on who they're partnered with. It also depends on your viewer base, and more specifically, how many viewers have Adblock.
On videos over 10mins you can put extra ads, and therefor some extra money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies pay to advertise on YouTube, YouTube gives a portion of that money to the uploader of videos with ads on them. The amount companies pay to advertise depends on a bunch of factors, like views of course, if it's skippable after 5 or 15 seconds, how many comments/likes the video gets, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially every time someone watches an ad the company that runs the ad pays YouTube, YouTube then splits it between themselves and the content creator
Keep in mind that each view is worth very little and revenue is usually measured in every thousand views</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
