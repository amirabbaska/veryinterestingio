		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I do this on a daily basis. Here are some things to note:</p>
<p>A fastener is not freed <em>just</em> by heating it. As in, you can't make it glow, then walk away for an hour, and expect it to turn when you come back. The parts will only turn when they're hot. Until you unthread it all the way, that is; or at least work it back and forth enough to 'clean' the threads...then it might continue to move after it cools (but it'll still fight you).</p>
<p>There is a critical temp above which things generally start to move. If 'a little' heat frees something...it wasn't stuck.</p>
<p>These kinds of observations have led me to believe that there are mainly two things happening when you heat a seized fastener. And when I say seized, I mean 'corroded.' If it's just 'tight,' yes, a torch may help you to break it free...but you shouldn't be using a torch; you should be using the proper tool to loosen. The torch is a last resort when something absolutely is not going to move by other means.</p>
<p>Anyway...with corrosion, what you're experiencing is two surfaces that are very rough and irregular. Compared to clean, smooth threads, those of seized fasteners have far more surface area locking them together. Think of it as the difference between trying to slide a sheet of copy paper across a tile floor, and trying to slide a piece of sandpaper across concrete.</p>
<p>The heat from the torch is making the metals expand, which is grinding all the little nooks and crannies of these irregular surfaces together, which helps to coax the fastener into moving.</p>
<p>The other thing that is happening, and why I say a truly 'stuck' bolt will have to be moved while it's still hot: you're actually deforming the metal...basically, you're retapping the hole as you thread the bolt.</p>
<p>If you took a nut that had been laying outside in saltwater for a month, and tried to thread a bolt into it, it wouldn't work. The bolt will just not want to start at all. Solution: get a tap and clean the threads up. Once the hole is tapped, the bolt should thread cleanly by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong>...just heat the nut. This will not work nearly as well...you will have to force the bolt...and once the nut cools, the bolt will not turn freely. Clearly, this is not optimal...but in the case of seized parts, this is the only option we have...obviously, taps and dies are not going to help us if the parts are still threaded together. So the torch allows us to, essentially, crudely mash the threads into something that kinda works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slight differences in expansion rates. All it takes is a bit to help loosen a bolt. </p>
<p>They might be heating evenly, but unless the metals are exactly the same composition, and you apply heat perfectly evenly, there will be plenty of movement. </p>
<p>Edit: I generally heat just the nut, only a second or two with a torch (little canister type). If it's an old crusty fitting I'll usually heat it before I even try loosening it, just to push the odds in my favor. Remember tho, that torch can fry anything non-metal in an instant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>if the screw and metal swells in heat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't swell - it scales.</p>
<p>The easiest way to think of it is that the gap between the screw and hole expands (in scale with) the the rest of the metal's expansion.</p>
<p>It actually wont be to scale 1:1, it'll be faster because of Pi. The reason it scales rather than swelling is because the relative position of each &quot;molecule&quot; of the metal must remain the same, so that forces the hole to actually expand in diameter, not contract.</p>
<p>I have &quot;molecule&quot; in quotes there because metellurgy is hard, and I'm not sure if its molecules, grains, or crystals. Or all of it.</p>
<p>The other mechanisms people are describing (differential expansion rates, loosening corrosion, differential temperatures, softening of the metal, etc....) are all viable effects too, but in answer to your specific question if you take a rust-free bolt/screw and put it in a rust-free hole in the same type of metal, and heat them in an oven to exactly the same temperature, they will fit more loosely when hot than cool.</p>
<p>Machinests often use heat to help perform press fits, although I am not a machinest so I'm basing that off youtube. Why I watch youtube videos of people machining things I cannot explain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you have a screw and a nut made of the same metal. If you heat both up, they should expand by the exact same ratio.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that the inner diameter of the nut is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the screw, so that there is a tiny gap between the two parts. If both parts expand by the same ratio, this gap also expands - making it easier to screw it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though the differential expansion explanation may have merit, having felt the significant benefit that heating a frozen bolt has, I think that there's something else that happens.   </p>
<p>If you've ever worked on an old rusty suspension system in an old rusty car, you've come across a bolt that won't budge. You've come to the end of the line for what socket wrenches, vice grips and pipe wrenches can accomplish. You've used half a can of WD-40 and you're at the point where any more torque runs the risk of stripping the head or breaking the bolt. And that's the point when you announce to all within earshot that you're bringing out &quot;The Hot Wrench!&quot;</p>
<p>And like magic, the bolt comes right out.</p>
<p>I think it's the coefficient of friction more than the differential expansion that allows the bolt to come out more freely. Similarly, a clutch or brake will fade when it gets hot and friction will decline rapidly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
