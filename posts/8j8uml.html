		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of possible explanations for why itching occurs during wound healing. One or more of these explanations may be correct.</p>
<p>Chemicals required for the wound healing process may also cause wound itching. Histamine is one of these potential for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2519061/" target="_blank">early wound itching</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1791057" target="_blank">plays a pivotal role in wound healing</a>, and is released in response to cellular injury. </p>
<p>Neuropeptides like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15792949/" target="_blank">Substance P are also released during the wound healing process,</a>. While <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8745057/" target="_blank">Substance P has been proven to cause mast cells to degranulate, releasing histamine as well as other chemicals responsible for The immunoinflammatory response</a> there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5546940/" target="_blank">other non-histamine controlled pathways activated by substance P have also been shown to cause itching,</a> which may show Substance P is partially independently responsible for transmitting pain and itch sensations to the brain. Mast cell degranulation and release of histamine is the primary accepted method that substance P triggers an itch sensation, but there is a possibility that there are other pathways involved in the itch sensation independent of histamine. </p>
<p>There is also a potential mechanical explanation for wound itching. There are nerves in the skin that transmit pain and itch signals to the brain. As the wound closes, the edges of the wound constrict as collagen and connective tissue grow, potentially activating these nerves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Histamine is released at the wound site during healing,  which promotes vascularization (angiogenesis) and production of growth factors which accelerate skin cell growth and differentiation at the wound site.  A side effect of this increased histamine is itching.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this question we first need to think about why we itch in the first place.</p>
<p>If you imagine a body which has to respond to irritating stimuli, the obvious way to do it is by having nerves at every point that might be affected by the stimulus and nerves at every point that will respond to any conceivable stimulus. This is not possible because the density of nerves and the range of stimuli make it far to 'expensive' in terms of neural machinery.</p>
<p>We have lots of nerves on our finger-tips and fewer on, for example, our upper arms. You can test this by using two reasonably sharp pencils and poking yourself gently. See how close you can get the points of the pencils before they feel like one point. The distance is much larger on your upper arm than it is on your palm or finger-tips. you might find that being able to see the pencils makes the experiment hard to do - get a friend to do it while you close your eyes. Ask them to poke you with either one pencil or two spaced randomly far apart but not tell you which until you report how many you can feel. If they are within about 1 or 2 centimeters of each other on your arm it will feel like one. On your finger tips the distance will be much less - maybe a couple of millimeters. </p>
<p>This difference in nerve density is because you use your finger tips for feeling what things are - people can read braille for example. But your arms are not often used for that so why would evolution keep the nerves so densely packed there.</p>
<p>So we need a mechanism to detect irritation that falls between the nerve endings that would be used to detect it. Otherwise we would be covered in all sorts of injuries or could cut ourselves without noticing. It is possible to inject someone (or draw blood) without them even feeling it if you, by luck, get your needle far enough from the closest nerve endings. On the other hand, some times it's horribly painful because, by bad luck, you happen to be right on top of one of the nerves.</p>
<p>We get around this with itching. When tissue is damaged it releases a range of signalling molecules - histamine, bradykinin, various cytokines... That spread over a small area of skin and activate the nerves in the skin. We perceive this as itching in some cases (not all, it's complicated and I don't remember all the details).</p>
<p>So if a bug bites you and it gets you between your nerve endings (like a mosquito, say) you won't necessarily feel the initial stab but you will feel an itch soon after.  The itch signals that you should scratch and, by doing this, you remove the offending bug - or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Like all mechanisms that are subject to evolution, it's not that clear cut and it's not perfect. Movement of hair follicles also signals that something is crawling on your skin and needs to be removed, for example.</p>
<p>The reason that scabs cause itching might be because they are biochemically evolved to do so but I think it's also possible that the hardened surface of the scab eventually breaks away from, and starts to move separately to, the skin and is therefore rubbing gently on the skin as you move your body. This would be a gentle irritation and would signal that you should scracth, which, in some cases, helps to remove the scab once it's done its job. It's possible that if you didn't, for example, little parasites could crawl under it and be well protected and well fed, so you want to get rid of the scab as soon as its job is done - but that's just conjecture on my part.</p>
<p>There are loads of other things that make us itch - chemical irritants that directly activate the nerves that signal itching, mental processes that make us alert to our skin signals (being in a room with someone with scabies makes me itch like mad even if I was previously absolutely fine) and a range of other things.</p>
<p>There are lots of requests for citations in this thread. I don't have any to hand but the point I'm making is that to cover every tiny part of your skin with nerves to detect every irritant would be very costly and would require a gigantic brain to process all the signals. All we really need is a process that says 'about here there seems to be a problem, can you pay some attention and deal with it please!', which is what itching does. </p>
<p>As for wounds, there are a bunch of possible reasons and evolution doesn't care which are right or wrong - it's probably down to a whole load of things but the point is that it's more useful than harmful so it wasn't lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
