		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They still absorb oxygen from the air through spiracles.  When the spiracles are submerged, they can't absorb oxygen.</p>
<p>Drowning has less to do with having lungs and more to do with not having gills.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just to help out people too lazy to read through the whole thread:</p>
<p>Insects breathe through tubes in their bodies called trachea - the openings are called spiracles.  The trachea branch from large central tubes from the spiracle openings into thinner and thinner tubes that permeate the insect's body, essentially giving their tissues direct access to air.  Breathing is, for the most part, passive.  The oxygen diffuses throughout the tube from the air, and CO2 diffuses out.  <em>Some</em> insects, especially larger ones, have mechanisms to drive air flow to increase the amount of oxygen they get.</p>
<p>Many insects (<a href="http://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2012/10/bell-spider-02.jpg.650x0_q70_crop-smart.jpg" target="_blank">and spiders</a>) can trap a bubble of air around their abdomens, which is often enough for them to breathe long enough to escape the water (not to mention giving them greater buoyancy), but that supply will not last forever if they stay submerged.  Because the direct access requires air, which exchanges gasses much more readily than water, if water gets into the trachea the insect will drown in pretty much the same way as animals do when water gets into lungs - both mechanisms are poorly adapted to exchange O2 and CO2 in water, and can't do it fast enough.</p>
<p>A surfactant (like soap) lowers the surface tension of water, which will collapse the bubble around the insect, drowning it much more quickly.  Some insects can close the spiracles and trap <em>some</em> air inside their bodies, but that oxygen won't last long.</p>
<p>There are many arthropods that live in the water, including some insects.  Some use the method mentioned above (trapping air around them), but many athropods do, in fact, have gills (like <a href="http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000lFnsL0xQetw/s/600/600/10002031.jpg" target="_blank">crayfish</a>).  Those with gills have the same problem in reverse - gills are poorly adapted to exchanging gasses without water, so they suffocate out of water.</p>
<p>Edit: several comments have mentioned book lungs. They are organs that many arachnids have, which are unrelated to true lungs like ours, but do a similar thing. Those species can drown in very little water if the cavity that holds the book lungs (which should be empty) fills with water.</p>
<p>Another point I glossed over is the gas exchange between the bubble and water when insects are submerged. Depending on the surface area of the bubble and how much oxygen is in the water, the bug may be able to stay submerged forever, since oxygen and CO2 will dissolve across the bubble's surface into and out of the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Thanks, /u/Pr00Dg for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air enters the insect's body through <a href="http://www.saburchill.com/images02/080106056.jpg" target="_blank">valve-like openings</a> in the exoskeleton(body). Air flow is regulated by small muscles that operate one or two flap-like valves. After passing through a spiracle, air enters a longitudinal tracheal trunk, eventually diffusing throughout a complex, branching network of tracheal tubes and reaches every part of the body. To prevent its collapse under pressure, a thin, reinforcing &quot;wire&quot; of cuticle (the taenidia) winds spirally through the membranous wall. This design (similar in structure to a heater hose on an automobile or an exhaust duct on a clothes dryer) gives tracheal tubes the ability to flex and stretch without developing kinks that might restrict air flow. The absence of taenidia in certain parts of the tracheal system allows the formation of <a href="http://e08595.medialib.glogster.com/media/cf/cf4f8380ac15f5e3145ae62570960893fcef72ef4c2400d957b71f56ad687ac9/131486651.png" target="_blank">collapsible air sacs,</a> balloon-like structures that may store a reserve of air.   In dry terrestrial environments, this temporary air supply allows an insect to conserve water by closing its spiracles during periods of high evaporative stress.   Aquatic insects consume the stored air while under water or use it to regulate buoyancy. During a molt, air sacs fill and enlarge as the insect breaks free of the old exoskeleton and expands a new one.   Between molts, the air sacs provide room for new growth -- shrinking in volume as they are compressed by expansion of internal organs. Small insects rely almost exclusively on passive diffusion and physical activity for the movement of gasses within the tracheal system.   However, larger insects may require active ventilation of the tracheal system (especially when active or under heat stress). They accomplish this by opening some spiracles and closing others while using abdominal muscles to alternately expand and contract body volume.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Larger insects have lung like structures, smaller ones not so much, they still contract muscles in their abdomen to suck air into openings in the body and thrust it out the other end just like your heart is constantly pumping blood from one opening to the other. Web like network of airways supply every part of the body with air.</p>
<p>Now if anyone wants to know how Arachnids (spiders) breathe...no idea. :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: As several posters have pointed out, they do <em>too</em> have a circulatory system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
