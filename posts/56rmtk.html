		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an engineer and have some experience in with this very scenario.  On almost every job I've done, the final look/functionality is what matters, and actually engineering the components and picking fasteners is my job, but that comes after figuring out how to make it actually work when I'm drawing it up in my CAD program of choice.  When I, my company, a coworker, my boss, or some combination thereof are deciding on fasteners, there is a flow chart of sorts we go through.  This helps us narrow it down a lot.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>what fasteners will work for the specific application.  I.E. the right length, head, diameter, and/or material.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we want it to be removable or not.  Are we including a tool for doing something to this screw.  Does it need to be tamper proof?  This is what leads to me using hex bolts on the outside where the end customer can access them from the back, below, or inside for whatever reason that is needed (usually updating the unit), and then phillips or whatever everywhere else we don't want them messing with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the screw effect the final look?  Is it going to sit flush to the surface in the same color? Okay we'll use a countersunk screw of the appropriate material.  Is it supposed to be a feature for something steampunk? Okay, big and brass it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do we already have available? Or what do the remaining options cost?  Or what are we typically already using? Often we will already be ordering fastener A for another project or have tons leftover from a previous project. This all comes down to cost saving.</p>
</li>
<li>What do I feel like using based on personal biases, preferences, and just being lazy?  In the end, the previous 4 are out of my control by the needs of the project, but I'll still be left with a few options. I'll often try to optimize one way or another, but sometimes I just say &quot;screw it, use 'screw xyz' because I like it.&quot; this is often what happens with phillips vs. flathead </li>
</ol>
<p>edit: post is locked, but I'm bored so feel free to PM me any relevant questions and I'd be happy to answer them if I can</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few comments here address most of it, here's another part:</p>
<p>There are thousands and thousands of fasteners and hardware out there to select from. The engineers designing these assemblies aren't designing the hardware, they're selecting off the shelf parts. The different hardware parts have different material qualities, and there is usually a trend in how that goes (ex. Hex head bolt is stronger than a Phillips machine screw, the plating they want only comes on a certain bolt, or the price of button heads is always lower than socket caps).</p>
<p>So while ease of assembly and maintenance/disassembly is often a goal, it's not necessarily a priority over saving $0.10 on each fastener on the hundreds of thousands of production units with 5 of that fastener.</p>
<p>As the other comments have said, different head have different purposes as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the requirements for the screw</p>
<p>Does it need to be easily accessible without tools (or cheap)-&gt; flathead (you can use almost anything which is flat for unscrewing/screwing it) </p>
<p>Does it need to be cheap and usable with power tools but also idiot proof (not possible to over tighten it)-&gt; Philips</p>
<p>Is torque going to be a problem (so if you would destroy a Philips screw by screwing it in) -&gt; Torx</p>
<p>So if you have a regular device which must be opened to replace parts regularly (filters and stuff) , most often the access panel will be locked with flathead screws, and once you get inside you'll get either Philips or Torx/Hex screws to remove components which usually aren't removed during regular maintenance </p>
<p>Same as, why are there different kinds of cars, depends on the specs, if you want to go off road you want one with loose suspension and higher ride, if you want to go fast round corners you want the exact opposite </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The philips head is designed so the screwdriver slips out if you put too much torque (twisting force) on it. So you can safely screw it on full speed with an electric screwdriver, with no risk of breaking anything.</p>
<p>The hex bolt doesn't slip out, so it's useful if you need to screw it really, really tight, or if there is no easy access to the screw, and you can't push against the screwdriver.</p>
<p>The torx head (star shape) is like the hex, but allows even more torque. It doesn't slip, but you have to be really careful or use screwdriver with torque limiter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lots of guessing going on in this thread, but for the most part they're all correct. Torque required usually determines the head, but availability and access play a role. Sometimes they just don't make a 4&quot; long screw with the head you need so you apply some loctite and move on. If it's going outdoors yiu may care more about the coating so it doesn't rust.</p>
<p>Check out www.mcmaster.com and search &quot;screws&quot;. You'll see on the left side where you can select things like &quot;length&quot; or head style. Notice how each filters out some of the types available in doing so. So certain combinations don't exist. Mcmaster is not the &quot;end all&quot; in that other options are in fact out there, but general rule of thumb is that if it's not on there then it's hard to come by. </p>
<p>Tl:DR answer: sometimes there is thought behind it and sometimes it's just availability. Knowing when each is acceptable keeps me employed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
