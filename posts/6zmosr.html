		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered about the same thing and quite recently I discovered that the hushing sound is the most common sound you can make with your mouth to calm down a newborn baby: they naturally calm down when they hear vibrations and white noises.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised it just came out from this: a lot of p√®arents who are used to hush to silence and calm their babies and simply go on doing that when they grow up, and, bang, you create the international conventional sound for silencing.</p>
<p>^there ^is ^nothing ^scientific ^about ^this, ^only ^personal ^observation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was told by a nurse in the birthing center that the &quot;husssh&quot; sound mimics the sound a mothers &quot;white-noise&quot; that is generated by her digestive tract and circulation system and then transmitted through the amniotic fluid to the childs ear.</p>
<p>I don't know how true this is... but it works.</p>
<p>I think it is probably something similar or it could just be a &quot;sensory overload&quot; for the child and a distraction from whatever is bothering them.<br />
Mom: Shhhhhhhhhh</p>
<p>Baby:&quot;Woah!... what's all this information coming from my ears into my brain... wait... I HAVE ears!?... when was someone going to tell me about this...and why am I thinking in English... I can't even talk or comprehend language yet... now... what was I whining about again?&quot;</p>
<p>From there it just becomes a universal human communication pattern to &quot;hush&quot; regardless of age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Going &quot;shhhhhh&quot; makes broadband (white) noise. It's (1) very audible, even when done quietly, and (2) clearly distinct from voices. I think we made a good choice assigning it as the &quot;be quiet&quot; sound.
I bet it doesn't work very well nearby waterfalls or steam valves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in France people would pour a cup of water from their balcony while we were being noisy walking home from the club. This happened on a few occasions.</p>
<p>I was told by locals that this wasn't to try and hit us but to tell us to shut the fuck up. </p>
<p>Could &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Shhh&quot; be linked to flowing water and the calming noise it makes?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
