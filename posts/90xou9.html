		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A train in a tunnel drives a pressure wave in front of itself with a lower-pressure region behind.  It's pushing and dragging air through the tunnel and the air can't flow freely and quickly enough past it to completely equalize the pressure.  With a combination of too long a tunnel and too tight a fit between train and tunnel, that pressure wave ahead of the train will actually strengthen into a shock wave.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assume the tunnel is one mile long, and the train travels at 60 MPH. </p>
<p>Imagine the train precisely fits the tunnel like the plunger in a syringe.   The air in the tunnel is still as the train approaches.   When the train enters the tunnel, that entire 1 mile long column of air has to be accelerated from 0 to 60 MPH in order to get out of the way of the train.  The air has mass and inertia, so it pushes back against the front end of the train and gets pressurized. </p>
<p>In practice, the train doesn't fit exactly, so some of the air goes around the train, but the concept is still valid. </p>
<p>If you were standing on the rear end of the train, you'd get the same effect, but it would be a low pressure area instead of a high pressure area.   The vacuum behind the train has to pull a 1 mile long column of air into the tunnel as the train moves through.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air which is accumulated in front of the train does not move instantly out of the tunnel.
If your train travels at speeds like 1m/s then you wont notice a difference in pressure, since your assumption is right that the pressure difference is gone into the outside air.
But when the train is fast the air can not completely reach the outside fast enough, so more and more air accumulates in front it will spread at the sides of the train where there is few space still a high pressure. This is pressing though the doors into the train increasing the pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right to think the pressure would be equal inside the tunnel and out. Until the train comes. It's the very train you're riding which alters the pressure, like a syringe with a less than tight seal, it forces the air ahead of it at such a rate that it's unable to escape quickly enough, thus causing the change in pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
