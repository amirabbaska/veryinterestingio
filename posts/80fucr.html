They explained in some cases it's due to ingredients affecting the bioavailability of the active ingredient, particularly in toothpastes containing Stannous Fluoride or potassium nitrate (sensitive tp's).</p>
<p>However he admitted it's largely due to marketing- if 1 company combined everything into 1 toothpaste others wouldn't; and think of how much shelf space in a store 1 tube takes compared to 20 which would affect sales</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Reckitt Benckiser, makers of Nurofen, were fined for false advertising in Australia over this. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-16/nurofen-fined-6m-for-misleading-consumer/8126450" target="_blank">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-16/nurofen-fined-6m-for-misleading-consumer/8126450</a></p>
<p>Quite possibly the same thing happens with toothpastes, but the lighter regulation means you can't so easily prove it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As one of the other commenters noted, this is a marketing tactic, not a scientific one.  The micro-segmentation of products within a category can accomplish two important goals for a company:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It can allow more potential customers to &quot;see themselves&quot; in your product.  If you offer just &quot;toothpaste&quot;, you will likely lose market share to a company that offers a &quot;enamel replacement toothpaste&quot; and a &quot;3-d whitening toothpaste.&quot;  That's because customers are known to value specific benefits over general ones [1].  As to your specific question--trying to pile all the benefits into one super toothpaste means that some of the benefits will be lost in the long list.  Customers typically pay attention to only the top two or three benefits of a product [2].</p>
</li>
<li>It allows the manufacturer to justify (asking for) more shelf space at retail, increasing their &quot;share of shelf&quot; relative to the competition.  Shelf-space allocation is a complex topic, because it involves explicit and implicit (ie, retail margin) payments, promotional activity, and package design, as well as product count--but in general, more variety of product types will help.  (As long as they're all selling).</li>
</ol>
<p>Mitigating against the proliferation of product variants are supply-chain considerations -- how many variants need to be produced and managed, how much inventory needs to be available, what raw materials are uniquely necessary for each variant vs shared among them, etc.  This is where modern supply-chain technology and approaches help a lot, thus enabling the explosion of product variants we've seen in many consumer-packaged-goods categories over the years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/toothpastes" target="_blank">ADA</a> there are different ingredients in toothpastes depending on the label </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Whitening&quot; toothpastes contain more abrasive action to scrape away surface stains, as noted in the link, and/or contain peroxide to remove stains </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Sensitive&quot; toothpastes contain ingredients to reduce tooth sensitivity </p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Fluoride&quot; toothpastes typically contain slightly higher concentrations of the active ingredient... 1400ppm-1450ppm, for example. </li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing, however, is a major answer to your question. <a href="http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/products/toothpastes" target="_blank">The FDA only regulates the &quot;anti-carries&quot; action of toothpaste </a> which is why you only see it under &quot;Active Ingredients&quot; on labeling and is some form of fluoride. All other claims are considered Cosmetics and regulated as such. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many of the gingivitis-focused toothpastes (&quot;gum strength&quot;), they contain stannous fluoride which can actually cause some staining to your teeth. So adding on a &quot;whitening&quot; label might piss some people off after those side effects become more visible</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
