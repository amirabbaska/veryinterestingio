		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short: We don't really know.</p>
<p>A bit longer: We heavily suspect that the solar magnetic field is generated by some kind of a dynamo effect in the convective envelope of the sun. It was long believed that the cause of this was lying in the shear region at the tachoclyne, the region between the radiative and the convective envelope. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18638" target="_blank">However research has shown that this likely isn't the case</a>. The dynamo therefore is probably located further outward in the convective envelope.  Unfortunately the solar magnetic field is relatively weak and this weakness makes it difficult to observe magnetic fields of other solar type stars. So we can hardly compare the solar magnetic field to that of other solar type stars. It also appears to be related to the temperature of the corona, maybe <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/never-before-seen-structures-suns-corona-signal-to-noise-algorithm-parker" target="_blank">the newly discovered structures</a> in the corona can help solve this and the coronal heating problem. </p>

<p>There's not too much more to add from what other people said (because as they've pointed out, theres a lot we don't know about why this happens). But there is an interesting point to bring up that hasn't been mentioned yet -- The length of a magnetic cycle seems to be correlated to the rotation rate of the star through something called the Rossby number. If you're interested, this paper is really interesting! <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03611.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03611.pdf</a></p>
<p>edit: I forgot to add, it seems somewhat likely that the sun has another cycle for it's magnetic activity, right now we think it might be ~87 years long. Look up &quot;Gleissberg cycle&quot; if that interests you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does it coincide with the orbit of Jupiter?</p>
<p>Yes, Jupiter takes 12 years to orbit the sun once, but I wonder if there is some 11-year pattern that comes out of that. Jupiter and the sun actually orbit a center of gravity outside the sun, so I was wondering if that had an effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting article, I’ll read the whole of it later. </p>
<p>When we talk about magnetic field change, is it the same thing as earth’ magnetic field change? (aka geomagnetic reversals) </p>
<p>Because I wonder how we are able to calculate the exact year cycle of the Sun’s where we still cannot know when and why earth’s gets reversed.</p>
<p>Normally magnetic reversals (I assume the principle is same for every planet that has a magnetic field) don’t have a stable period or exact time of cycles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
