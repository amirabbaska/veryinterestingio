The loud shouting was to inform anyone your interest of selling or buying a quantity of stock at a price. Once you find someone to make the trade with, you each fill out a trading slip and the transaction is confirmed. </p>
<p>Now, more popularly, the asking and bidding on shares is performed via computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Guy 1: &quot;I'm selling $STOCK for $MONEY&quot;</p>
<p>Guy 2: &quot;I'll buy 1,000 $STOCK for $MONEY!&quot;</p>
<p>Guy 1: &quot;Sold!&quot;</p>
<p>Remember, the movie scenes are almost always pegged on some crazy fiscal meltdown. It didn't look that chaotic most of the time.</p>
<p>These days it's all digital. Sellers post their prices, and buyers try to buy only to get screwed out of a nickel by unscrupulous flash traders. Heh. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays it's almost entirely electronic. Traders submit orders into the exchange that are like &quot;I want to buy 100 shares of XYZ at $30,&quot; and as soon as someone is willing to sell at that price, the exchange informs both parties that the trade has occurred. The exchange will also list what the current highest &quot;bid&quot; and lowest &quot;ask&quot; are, so you'd see that someone is currently willing to buy 100 shares of XYZ for $30 and someone else is willing to sell 500 shares for $30.01. You can also submit a &quot;market order&quot; like &quot;sell 1000 shares to whomever will give me the best price,&quot; which in the above example might cause you to sell 100 shares to the guy bidding $30, then another 400 to some other guy bidding $29.99, and the last 500 to someone else bidding $29.98. The exchange will automatically figure out who owes what and handle the transactions.</p>
<p>However, this was all much harder before computers. Instead of submitting your order automatically, you'd need to have someone on the floor of the exchange yelling about how much you wanted to buy/sell and the price. When you tried to buy stock for your personal account, your bank would then contact their floor trader to buy that stock for you. The pieces of paper were for writing down what trades that trader personally had done. When you'd see those people in movies, it'd be during major moves in the price, which would cause significant activity in the area and increase the general level of chaos.</p>
<p>You might think &quot;why wouldn't they lie about what happened?&quot; They could do that, but failing to follow through with a trade just because it ended up bad for you would destroy your reputation, and the rest of the traders would know and you'd never get trades again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In very very very basic terms it's the super dilution of ownership of a company. Stock is basically, well the stake of a company, broken up into tiny tiny pieces and put on the public market. Usually a board of directors own enough shares to control the company while the shares that go out on the market are called publicly traded shares.</p>
<p>Say for example, you are a cannibal recipe website called Facecook and you as a private company have grown in popularity. You now need an injection of money to go to the next level and you don't want some huge investment firm controlling so much they could replace you. You break up your company's ownership into tiny shares, keep a majority for yourself, pass on some smaller amounts to your board of directors and your employees and the rest goes on the market.</p>
<p>You set a reasonable valuation for it on the day it goes public, called the IPO or initial public offering. People all want a piece of the action, because they know if you do well, the stock value goes up (including that face cook stock you bought). Stock price goes up as demand goes up, or if there's rumors of something awesome you're doing.</p>
<p>But in all honesty, most people on the public market are there as hawkers at a bazaar. Their aim is to buy at low prices and sell at high prices. The amount they get to own of your company is so little, they have little to no say in what your company does as an individual. But as a collective, every time there's Frenzy to buy, they drive your stock price up and inject capital into your company. </p>
<p>EDIT (here's the part you were looking for):
For individuals who play the game at the frenzied bazaar full time, they're all trying to hit gold. Have those few super massive successful trades that can make them millionaires in a matter of minutes. With thousands of people trading non stop around the world, values fluctuate like crazy. And provided you have the right mix and the right access to buy and sell stocks from the right company, you can make a killing (and lose it). When they scream sell sell sell, they want people to dump the stock because there's reason to believe it will drop. Once it bottoms out. They'll buy it again and sell it once it rises.</p>
<p>It's like a manifestation of what nature is - an adrenaline fuelled chaotic race for survival over limited resources where wit, cunning and luck can all work in your favour or you can lose out despite 'doing everything right'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
