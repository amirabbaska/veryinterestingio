		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something vaguely related to this phenomenon, but sadly I have no source (hopefully someone can back me up with real sources).<br />
If I remember correctly, <strong>a part</strong> of enjoying music is being able to relate to the music, being able to predict what comes next. That is why music that is &quot;in tune&quot; will sound more pleasant than music out of tune, because we don't listen to much music out of tune and therefore are not accustomed to it. Music that we do not like is generally music we cannot predict well and that doesn't stimulate us. By listening to music that we do not enjoy, we are forcing our brains to work hard at trying to guess what comes next but because it's no good at it, it needs to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>A useful analogy is that of how a (computer) processor predicts what it needs to do:<br />
First it will pick which branch (of multiple possible choices) of execution to expect.<br />
Then, possibly before it even knows which branch it will <em>really</em> take, it will load some relevant information into memory.<br />
When the CPU realizes that it is following another path, it has done a lot of work for nothing and discards the information and starts over from the beginning of the mispredicted branch.</p>
<p>It's possible that our brains evolved this &quot;feature&quot; to reward intelligence (or rather, being good at predicting outcomes), but since I am a software engineer and not a biologist or geneticist, I really wouldn't know.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> (disclaimer) to clear up some confusion:<br />
I never stated that our brains <em>prefer</em> predictability over spontaneity, just that predictability <em>plays a part</em> in it. Indeed many of us seek out unpredictability in music, there is a balance to be had. Likewise, once we can perfectly predict the music we can get bored of it, causing an inverse effect. There are a lot of good points made in the thread of this comment which either further elaborate or provide alternate points of views, all of which may or may not be valid. </p>
<p>I personally think that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr8758/" target="_blank">this reply provides a good alternate point of view</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr7he1/" target="_blank">this partly addresses loudness (which I did not touch on)</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr5iw7/" target="_blank">this drives another alternate point of view, touching on the notion of music appreciation as learned behavior</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studying music in university. I've never experienced this, am unsatisfied with the answers and am wondering if people can give more details about their experiences. Does the headache linger or go away right when the music is turned off? Is it a consistent thing? For whom is it a volume thing and who is effected by quiet music? Also about your histories with music. Are you big fans of specific kinds of music? Does anyone get a headache from music they mildly dislike? Do you do a particularly careful job choosing what you listen to?</p>
<p>Also if you think you have boring answers to all these, I'd still appreciate answers, just so we have a better idea of what's normal instead of just people with controversial opinions. Thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loudness may not be the culprit. Have you ever heard a brand new song, and despite it being by one of your favorite artists, you don't really enjoy it that much the first few times you hear it? Its your favorite artist though, so you'll listen to it a few more times and maybe hear it on the radio a time or two. Then one day you realize you actually like the song very much. <em>Seems weird, right?</em></p>
<p>I'll diverge a second. As humans, we generally stick to habits, and any deviation from our typical habits feels unusual and different. It takes a couple (sometimes a lot more) attempts at a new routine to turn it into a habit, and our bodies might respond during that transition period by aches and pains. Telling you, hey this is different, I don't like different. Music works on us the same way, because listening to music is a habit. You hear music you don't like and your brain finds a way to balance it out, or force you to stop it, which is where a headache can occur.</p>
<p>It turns out that the radio industry has had to create techniques of gradually adjusting listeners to new songs, even if radio executives already know the song is going to be a hit. The challenge is to prevent you from changing the radio channel (or turning it off) when you hear a new song that you don't quite like right away. One way to do this is by sticking the new song in between two already popular and well liked ones. You don't immediately notice that this unfamiliar new song is playing because you just heard one you really like. What happens by the time you notice the new song playing? It ends and another popular song comes back on. After hearing the new song a few times, even if you weren't all that focused on it, your brain is more familiar with it. Have this happen a few more times and you might soon find that you really like the song because your brain got </p>
<p>I first read about this in a book called &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; by Charles Duhigg, which explores our habits in general, including how they can be developed or changed, and uses music as an example at times. One example in the book is &quot;Hey Ya&quot; by Outkast. It became an incredibly popular song, but at first radio listeners literally hated it. To make people like it, the song was first squeezed between two already popular ones and eventually it reached the top spot on Billboard for 8 weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbasket.blogspot.com/2014/12/who-killed-good-music.html" target="_blank">Another article that discusses the Hey Ya situation and references The Power of Habit</a></p>
<p>Edit: I want to summarize 2 other situations that have been asked in comments.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why do I dislike music I've listened to constantly, such as at work? My brain knows what to expect right?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you like country music and hate heavy metal, but your jerk of a coworker always plays his metal too loud. You could hear his music over and over again but odds are that you won't like it ever. Simply put: you don't like metal, you like country. You respond positively to country and metal is nothing like it, so your brain forms no connections between the two.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What about a brand new song that I instantly fell in love with? Even if the artist is someone I've never heard of?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It's probably pretty similar to something else you've heard before, musically speaking. The song's beat, the artists' voices, the rhythm, etc. something about the music itself was noticed by the brain and connected to other songs you like. What's the thing about Nickelback songs? They all sound pretty similar, and most people that like one of their songs (crazy, I know) tend to like most of their music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
