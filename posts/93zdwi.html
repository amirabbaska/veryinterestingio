		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with water pressure or anything like that. I assume you are referring to the pain when you accidentally snort a liquid through your nose.</p>
<p>The pain you are referring to can happen with ANY liquid and at any volume. You could shoot a hose at yourself while standing on dry land and experience this pain.</p>
<p>The pain comes from when you get water or other liquid up your nose and past your nostrils into your sinus cavity. It has to be specifically up your nose. If you don't get any water entering your nose you will not experience the pain OP is talking about. So if someone dives into the water and is holding their nostrils closed, no problem. However if they accidentally tumble into the water and inadvertently breath in water through their nose, hello pain!</p>
<p>When the water enters your nose and gets into the sinus cavities, it comes into contact with thousands of nerve endings. These nerve endings don't like being assaulted by water or other liquids as it's alien to their environment. Plus there are loads of bits in your nose that are designing for emitting things (Think nose mucus) and they REALLY do not like having a foreign substance coming back at them.</p>
<p>This is the source of the pain. It's not really felt in the back of the head, this is more a case of assumption on your part because the pain is in such a generalised area of the nose.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>So the folks going on about salinity, neti pots, water temperature and how saline water that matches the noses salinity and temperature doesn't hurt are completely correct but c'mon, this is ELI5 I wasn't going to go that deep! Heheh, deep...water...geddit??.... Anyway it's a very specific circumstance that your unlikely to find by accident.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, yes if the water's salinity and temperature match the nasal cavity, this water will not cause the burning pain described by OP. But anything else will!</p>
<p>For the folks asking why you cannot go upside down in water without experiencing the burning pain OP describes, it's because your ingesting water through your nose. When you are right side up, your nostrils act as something of a diving bell and prevent the water from going into your nose.</p>
<p>However when you go upside down the nostrils are removed from the equation and suddenly the water, assisted by gravity and the pressure of the water caused by it's weight, is pushing down and into your nose and forcing it's way into the nasal cavity. The deeper you are when you are in the water, the more powerful the effect becomes because the water pressure is higher and thus finds it easier to force it's way into your nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure differentials. Basically, water is more dense than air, so going under it means there is more pressure trying to push into the holes in your body. Water is trying to go into your ears and nose, but there is already air in there, so the air gets trapped. As the water tries to fill these spaces, it's going to equalize the pressure between the water and air until they are the same pressure. That increase in pressure against your inner-ear and sinuses is what you are feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I also get this pain in the back of my head. But only if I dive/swim underwater and turn upside down in a pool. Does not always happen but at least 2 times every time I enter a pool. And then after the pain I usually sneeze a ton. Happens extremely extremely rarely in salt water though. Maybe one in a 150 (I live on an island).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
