		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the relative diameters of the donutâ€™s ring and donut hole... but assuming that the ratios are such that the structure is stable enough to exist as a donut and not crush into a ball...  </p>
<p>The center of gravity would exist as an annulus sitting slightly inside the core of the donut towards the central point.  Inside the core because the gravity of the rest of the planet would still have some impact, like the moon does on the earth.  </p>
<p>You would be slightly heavier on the outer edge of the donut, slightly lighter on the inside, but able to stand on the donut surface.  </p>
<p>Satellite orbits would be more complicated to calculate but they could travel in a variety of paths including a winding path around the donut annulus.  </p>
<p>Edit: lighter on the inside not heavier </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried to do the math on this one once. To simplify it, you imagine your donut as an infinitesimally thin ring of very high density. Then you can do some calculus to figure out what the gravitational field looks like at any other point by figuring out how each element of the ring affects you.</p>
<p>It's actually quite easy to calculate in two places: anywhere down the central axis, due to symmetry, and anywhere in the plane of the torus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, anywhere else involves an elliptical integral with no definite solution. You can sort of brute force it with a numerical approximation, but it's quite annoying - best left to a computer program. </p>
<p>The reason I did these calculations was: I wanted to know what the surface would look like if you poored a bunch of water on it. Where would the water go? If you took a thin slice through the donut, would it look like two circles? If it was allowed to deform to the shape of the gravitational field, it actually looks more like two teardrops, with the pointy ends pointing at each other. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the geophysicist in me wasn't satisfied with that. So I continued to think about it for a while. Turns out that, if the original ring is not perfectly uniform, and the water itself has mass, all of the water will eventually gather in one place. It ends up looking like a <a href="https://i5.walmartimages.ca/images/Thumbnails/163/430/999999-74345163430.jpg?odnBound=200" target="_blank">kettlebell</a> once the water flows and establishes a new equilibrium.</p>
<p>But, unless this toroidal planet has been engineered with some extreme form of rigidity, the planet itself will flow - like the Earth does with plate tectonics. Eventually it'll collapse into a sphere.</p>
<p>This could be solved by engineering a rigid enough structure, and installing 'baffles' to prevent the matter from flowing to one place. Or it could be some sort of fantasy setting with a dead planet sized Ouroboros that magically doesn't collapse. </p>
<p>Basically, the gravity looks cool. And then it collapses into a sphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be a point of unstable equilibrium; the gravity field, visualized in two dimensions, would be shaped like a hill; if you can stay precisely on top you will experience net zero forces; move any amount off the top and you start to roll down hill (fall into the gravity well of the torus). It would be pretty similar to Lagrange points L1, 2, and 3 but with a hilltop rather than ridgeline shape. </p>

<p>We already park satellite at unstable Lagrange points; they have to use a small amount of fuel to maintain their position over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
