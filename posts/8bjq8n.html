		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of orbit gets a little strained beyond the order of galaxies. The Milky Way pretty definitely orbits the Local Group barycenter. The Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster, and it's not entirely clear what is orbiting what within that group (taking the two body problem to an extreme). Beyond the Virgo Supercluster, there are filaments, with many elements on escape paths. At least at the level of filaments, dark energy dominates, and I wouldn't describe anything as orbiting at that point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, objects have gravity, right?  Earth, as a whole body, has a certain gravitational mass.  Everything on Earth, the core, the mountains, the oceans, buildings, cars, people:  are all part of Earth’s mass.  If you think about it, “Earth” is just a bunch of tiny parts that share a center of gravity at Earth’s core.</p>
<p>So when we look at Earth’s relegation to the moon, we often think of the moon orbiting around Earth because Earth has a greater mass.  The truth, Earth and our moon are orbiting around each other, or more accurately, around the shared center of gravity, which is somewhere between the core and the surface of Earth.</p>
<p>The same is true as you go bigger.  The gravity of every body in our solar system affects every other body to some degree.  The center of gravity for our solar system isn’t the center of the sun, but somewhere slightly off center, and constantly shifting.  Our galaxy’s center of gravity is also somewhere slightly off center, and constantly shifting.  Our galaxy shares a center of gravity with other galaxies, and really, the universe.</p>
<p>Of course, as we get larger in scale, the question of he affect of gravity and the “center of gravity” gets muddied due to the expansion of the universe and our limited understanding of its “size”.</p>
