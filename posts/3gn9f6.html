		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess I'm qualified to answer this question. I studied in a Tibetan university in India for a while, studied Tibetan Buddhism and I have a PhD in Buddhist Studies. I should say that my real area of expertise is Theravada Buddhism but I know a fair bit about Tibetan Buddhism. </p>
<p>There is a lot of guess work and supposition in this thread but there is a real answer to why Tibetan Buddhism is so popular and known about in the West.</p>
<p>First, you need to look at the original study of Tibetan Buddhism by Westerners in the 18th ce. When Tibetan Buddhism was first &quot;discovered&quot; by Western society it was initially thought to not even be a true representation of Buddhism but was rather a corrupted version of the Buddha's &quot;original&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; teaching as written about in the Pali source materials. So initially scholars rejected Tibetan Buddhism and viewed Theravada Buddhism (Buddhism practiced in Sri Lanka and South-East Asia) as a &quot;true&quot; representation of Buddhism. ...All these quotation marks are to indicate that these views were radically simplistic and were viewed through a Western lens coloured by imperialist and orientalist doctrine.</p>
<p>So the point is that for a long time Tibetan Buddhism was not regarded as being of much virtue for a long time and the focus was on other forms of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Then what happened in around the 1970s is that a few people in the West fell into Tibetan Buddhism as a religious pursuit. One such person was Robert Thurman (funnily enough he is the father of actress Uma Thurman - she is even named after Uma, the Hindu god). There were others, but he is a good example of a Western Buddhist acolyte who learnt Tibetan Buddhism in a religious context in India. Another incredibly important person here is Jeffrey Hopkins who became lived in India, studied Tibetan Buddhism and became a translator and interpreter for the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>These Western born Tibetan Buddhists are important in this story because they were first of all Buddhists, second of all scholars. They had a proselytizing impulse. They wanted to teach the world about Tibetan Buddhism BUT, more importantly, they wanted to help save Tibetan Buddhist culture. Remember, the Chinese had banished many Tibetans into exile and Tibetan culture was under the very real threat of extinction. Saving Tibetan Buddhism is not just an important cultural matter, it is a religious matter because - according to TB - TB (well, depending on what sect of TB we are talking about) holds the one true view of Buddhism that can save the world from ignorance etc. </p>
<p>Armed with this view, these scholar-monks return to the US with the notion of reinvigorating TB in the West. Hopkins is especially important here. He returns to the West and after pursuing a PHD becomes a faculty member at Uni of Virigina. There he begins to expand Buddhist Studies rapidly and essentially created a production facility for Western (mostly American) scholars versed in Tibetan Buddhism.There are numerous names that can be dropped here, but let me just say that the program was so successful that I can safely say that Tibetan Buddhism is now one of the most popular forms of Buddhism studied in Western universities despite the fact that the majority of Buddhists around the world are NOT Tibetan Buddhist. So there is now a disproportionate focus on Tibetan Buddhism. </p>
<p>All these scholars led to an increase in knowledge about Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetan Lamas (monks) were invited to the US to participate in talks and public discussions. People began to get interested in these monks. People started to get interested in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that there was a huge consciousness raising exercise in the minds of many Westerners which started in the 70s and continue on to today. It is not irrelevant that the 70s was a period where people were already interested in &quot;alternative&quot; religions and Buddhism was particularly of interest. In the US this coincided with the rise of Tibetan Buddhism due to this focus on TB through these scholars.</p>
<p>Again, this focus on Tibetan Buddhism was a conscious and unconscious product of a need for Westerners to be accepting and positive about Tibetan Buddhism in order to make sure that Tibetan Buddhists had powerful international supporters to help prevent the extinction of TB at the hands of Chinese expansionism and cultural imperialism.</p>
<p>What you find today is a particular account of Tibetan Buddhism produced by Tibetan Buddhist afficiandos in the West - and the Dalai Lama marketing machine - that is palatable to Western tastes. The DL is very clear that Buddhism is consistent with science, physics, evolution, and democracy. These are all cherished contemporary progressive Western ideas and it is not an accident that it is claimed that Buddhism - Tibetan Buddhism in particular - is conssitent with this. But this is primarily a marketing exercise by the DL. In reality the DL is less embracing of these ideas in Tibetan circles and few Tibetan Buddhists really understand the details of these concepts or care to wonder whether they are or aren't compatible. There are doctrinal reasons why this is all okay and fits with Tibetan Buddhist and Mahayana ideas of truth, but that is a different more complicated matter. </p>
<p>TLDR: Two things: 1) In the 70s there was an upsurge of interest in Tibetan Buddhism that was the product of an increased profile in Tibetan Buddhist studies at universities in the US; and 2) it is part of a marketing exercise to help ensure that Tibetan Buddhism is well supported in the West in order to counter cultural extinction after the occupation of Tibet. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know very little about Tibetan Buddhism, but I can tell you what the average daily life is like for a monk. My family is Thai Buddhist, and I was raised that way, so I can at least tell you about what it's like for us.</p>
<p>The answer is, it depends. It depends on where you are, what kind of temple you're at, if at all, and how far along you are in your, lets call it, career, as a monk.</p>
<p>There are a few things that are the same, for most monks. Traditionally, you wake up very early, take your offering bowl (which is one of the few possessions that you're allowed to own) and go from house to house asking for food. Lunch is the same way. We don't eat dinner since two meals are seen as enough to sustain you, especially since as a monk you aren't engaged in hard labor. This is one aspect of the Middle Path, where eating too little (malnutrition) and eating too much (gluttony) are both distractions from you trying to achieve enlightenment. </p>
<p>The rest of your time is spent either learning the Buddha's teachings (the Dhamma), meditating, or teaching other people Buddhism. That's the theory, anyway. In practice, it depends.</p>
<p>For example, in the US, there isn't a tradition of giving food to random monks knocking on your door. So here, the monks live at the temple and people bring the offerings to them. Every week, we'd have a ceremony where people would symbolically put food in the offering bowls, and then give money afterwards to support the temple and the monks. So, just adapting to different circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, about the actual studying Buddhism thing. The whole point of becoming a monk is that you are giving up the material world (wealth, physical pleasure, having kids) in order to focus on attaining enlightenment and breaking out of the cycle of reincarnation. So at the start of your life as a monk, when you're first ordained, most of your time is going to be spent reading and memorizing the Dhamma. The Buddha never himself wrote down his teachings, so each sect has their own version of what he said, as well as their different interpretations of how to practice. For example, Thai monks are not allowed to drink alcohol, because it clouds the mind and is an earthly pleasure which is distracting you from enlightenment. Japanese Buddhist monks, though, can drink. I'm pretty sure there's literally millions of differences like that between all the different sects, so remember that when you come across something that contradicts me, like your Indian Buddhist friend telling you I'm 100% wrong about something, that's probably just cultural or sectarian differences. </p>
<p>Anyway. So, as you progress, you'll spend less time learning the teachings and more time interpreting them. Senior monks will teach you about what a certain parable means, or the implications of one interpretation or another. You'll still be doing a lot of meditating, at all points in your career. I would say that 4 hours per day, spread out into increments, is normal. Sometimes a lot more, if you're in a period when you're struggling with something, or trying for intense self improvement. Sometimes less, if you're busy with other duties.</p>
<p>What other duties, you ask? Well, monks don't get to just hole up and study. They have some things that they give back to the community. There's rituals and ceremonies that you'll have to perform. Weddings, funerals, births, sermons, these are all typical things that monks are expected to do. Some of them are a little weird to western standards. For example, whenever a building is being built, the owners will give an offering to the temple for some monks to come and bless it. And there's loads of random things like that that will take up a monks time. </p>
<p>Remember way up at the top when I talked about <em>where</em> your temple was? So, in rural Thailand, in small villages, often the temple will function as a school. The children will go and, in addition to getting a religious education, they'll learn to read and write, maybe some basic math or history too. </p>
<p>I hope this was helpful, and, if you have any specific questions, I'll try to answer them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably going to get buried BUT I did live at Tibetan monastery (in exile, though, so in India) for a little while and was working with them for my projects in college and grad school. I'll try to answer you question as best as I can and if you have any follow up questions feel free to comment or PM me. I'm very happy and excited to talk about my work. :)</p>
<p>A day-to-day of the monks I worked with was pretty much: wake up, meditate, study, debate, meditate, study, debate, etc. There were breaks for food, sleeping, and other stuff like hanging out in McLeod Ganj. </p>
<p>A lot of monks aren't that different from college students in my experience, although I was working with monks trying to achieve Geshe status (which is like an intense PhD in Philosophy), so they have been studying and debating a lot more than the average Tibetan monk and nun.</p>
<p>The second park of your question is a little more difficult to pin down. Tibet has always been &quot;interesting&quot; from a Buddhist studies perspective because their type of Buddhism is very different from other types of Buddhism. Basically, what sets them apart, is that they believe enlightenment is achievable in this lifetime - most Buddhist sects will optimistically estimate that it takes 3 aeons for you to reach enlightenment. So there's a lot of Tibetan practices to stimulate this-lifetime-enlightenment which are 1. secretive and 2. seem weird to both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.</p>
<p>Historically, Tibet was a country in which the religion was synonymous with their government. HHDL (His Holiness the Dalai Lama) is both a spiritual leader and (was) a political leader. All of these things make Tibet and Tibetans unusual - this obviously includes the monks.</p>
<p>No doubt SFT has played a role in the popularity of Tibet, but the Tibetan Incident happened in 1951 and SFT was founded in 1994, so people had interest before that. I think they may be popular now due to collective awe/&quot;orientalism&quot; regarding Tibet AND the fact that the current cultural climate is Tibet focused in terms of protests. Self-immolations (setting yourself on fire as an act of protest) is something occurs across the Buddhist world but is more famous <em>right now</em> from Tibetan monks. Maybe during the Vietnam war, when Vietnamese Buddhist monks were self-immolating, Southeast Asian Buddhism was a popular image. Who knows?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lived in a Buddhist monastery of the Tibetan tradition outside of Kathmandu for a year.  The younger monks went to class about 6 hours a day.  Older ones did various things. The religiously minded ones studied and memorized, there was training on how to do sand mandalas and make torma.  There was the summer rains retreat when everyone stayed on the grounds.  There were 6-8 weeks of vacation at some point where a lot of them went home.  Some worked in the kitchen.  A couple drove cars, ran the book shop.  Some were teachers.  A couple of accountants and administrators.  Before the road was paved there was a week or two of road work every year.</p>
<p>A very few did retreat.  The nuns down the road were much more practice oriented.  Several of them were in 3 year retreats.  Not sure if that kind of difference is common.  </p>
<p>The brighter. more religious boys went to South India at a certain point to study for the Geshe degrees (this was a Gelug outfit).  Some came back to teach.  Also some of them were being trained as translators to go to the west and work in centers.  This place was unusual at the time as English and Math were taught as well so that the boys who did not stay in the monastery had a start on secular educations.  One of them went to Singapore and got a college degree in business, without ever giving up his robes.</p>
<p>Any of that help?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things unmentioned here:</p>
<p>There has been a lot of celebrity interest in this movement and in the current Dalai Lama in particular. In addition there were some very popular Tibetan Missionaries in the sixties and seventies that got a lot of traction with the alternative liftestyle type crowd (Trogam Rinpoche comes to mind), and as a result of these two movements AS WELL AS the Free Tibet crowd, there has been a much higher level of awarness.</p>
<p>The other thing worth pointing out is that Tibetan Buddhism is actually very, very different from average mainstream Buddhism in most Buddhist countries. Not only is it much smaller in terms of adherents, but doctrinally it is very different from the mainstream of most Buddhist nations. To put it in perspective, if Buddhism were Christianity, Tibetan Buddhism would be like Seventh Day Adventists or Jehovah Witnesses. </p>
<p>Also, I would add that Tibetan Buddhism seems to fit into this Orientalist paradign many Western people have of Buddhism--- ancient and strange smells and bells coming from a foreign land at the very heights of the world, unblemished by the lowly, earthly desires of the unenlightened modern mind. Not that, that is true for everyone, but it seems to be an undercurrent for many interested parties. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
