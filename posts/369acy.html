		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like I said in the title, I am not interested in hateful or racist explanations. To me this is obviously a social and cultural issue, and not about Chinese or Asian people as a race. </p>
<p>I have noticed several news articles popping up recently about poor behaviour of Chinese tourists, such as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2979419/Famous-Thai-temple-finds-centre-international-row-banning-uncivilised-Chinese-tourists-new-toilet-urinated-walls.html" target="_blank">this one about tourists at a Thai temple</a>, and videos like this one about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5QTPUskwLY" target="_blank">queuing</a>. </p>
<p>I work as a part time cashier and I've also noticed that Chinese people who are<strong> new</strong> to the country treat me and and my coworkers rudely. They ignore greetings and questions, grunt at you rather than speaking, throw money at you rather than handing it to you, and are generally argumentative and unfriendly. I understand not speaking English, but it seems people from other cultures are able to communicate this and still be able to have a polite and pleasant exchange. </p>
<p>Where is this coming from? I have heard people say that these tourists are poor and from villages, but then how are they able to afford international travel? Is this how people behave while they are in China? I would have thought a collectivist culture which also places a lot of value on saving face and how one is perceived wouldn't be tolerant of unsocial behaviour? Is it a reflection of how China feels about the rest of the world? Has it always been this way or is this new? It just runs so contrary to what I would expect from Chinese culture. I've also heard that the government is trying to do something about it. How has this come about and what solutions are there? Is there a culturally sensitive way I should be responding, or should I just grin and bear it? I'm sure there are many factors responsible but this is an area I just don't know much about and I'd really like to understand.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments. I appreciate how many carefully considered points of view have come up. Special thanks to /u/skizethelimit, /u/bruceleefuckyeah, /u/crasyeyez, /u/GuacOp, /u/nel_wo, /u/yueniI /u/Sustain0 and others who gave thoughtful responses with rationale for their opinions. I would have liked to respond to everyone but this generated far more discussion than I anticipated. </p>
<p>Special thanks also to Chinese people who responded with their personal experiences. I hope you haven't been offended by the discussion because that was not my intention. Of course I don't believe a country of over one billion people can be generalized, but wanted to learn about a particular social phenomenon arising from within that country.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born in China, but migrated young, so I try to empathize with both sides.</p>
<p>The Chinese are a very competitive bunch. But the bigger idea is that many are still struggling to make ends meet. With so many people competing for the same few things, we tend to care more about our own success and have less regard for a society as a whole. I wouldn't take care of others if I can't take care of myself, right?</p>
<p>Furthermore, (just my personal opinion though) perhaps education plays a part. The education system might focus less on a societal perspective. Sciences are championed over the arts there, and technical knowledge doesn't make students more conscious of society. The rural population might not even have gone through much education to begin with.</p>
<p>This is why people tend to be less considerate than those of other societies, even similar ones like Hong Kong. When people become more affluent, they naturally become more considerate of their environment and the people around them.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean China isn't making progress. People are becoming richer. I increasingly observe people giving up seats to those more needy aboard buses, and also becoming more aware of climate change. Inconsiderate individuals have become a minority. Yet it takes time for the mindset to catch up to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sparing less thought for society does not mean they are selfish. My Chinese relatives are the warmest and most hospitable people I've met. They might not have a good public image, but they make good friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On one of my politics course, we had a segment on China and the same question popped up.</p>
<p>One of the readings goes like this: China's intellectuals had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolutuon of Mao. In order for communism to succeed in China, Mao had to prevent the rise of intellectuals (students, professors etc) as it was seen as the base of middle class. The middle class is the base of democracy which would destroy the government's ideology.</p>
<p>So in order to do that, Mao changed the whole educational curriculum of the system and initiated some economic plan to prevent the people from having money. Mao also had complete control and support of the military because of the recent civil war against the KMT and used that to subjugate revolts from all across China.</p>
<p>So by destroying the intellectuals which is one of the characterisitc of the middle class, Mao prevented democracy and a superb amount of uneducated individuals. That is what you see on tourists who don't know how to act etiquettely on foreign lands because of their lack education.</p>
<p>PS: I no longer remember what example the authors gave but that's the gist of their arguement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you have to remember (or let me tell you) is that less than 100 years ago, China still operated under feudalism with a dynastic emperor, and while some of the country has caught up to modern social graces i.e. Shanghai and Beijing other places have not.</p>
<p>Similarly, alot of the problems stem from alot of people being nouvea riche in the extreme (as well as getting too rich too fast after being poor/a peasant for too long)and literally having more money than they can handle leading to often ostentatious displays of wealth </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things people here are missing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Chinese people who can afford to travel abroad are disproportionately wealthy. That means a lot of them are spoiled rotten, and used to the world revolving around them. This is changing as China's middle class grows, but you still have to remember that the people you abroad aren't average Chinese, they're Chinese with the money and free time to travel internationally. Especially in the US, that means they also had the time/money to go through the visa process.</p>
</li>
<li>Chinese tend to travel in massive groups, which means if one guy is doing something obnoxious, it's easy for people to look and say wow, Chinese tourists, when actually most of them are being respectful. All it takes is one or two dicks making a scene to make the whole group look bad. Now I'm not saying the reputation they have is wholly undeserved, and some things (like not queuing) are more universal. But when there's an obvious group and a few bad eggs it's easy for people to draw conclusions and perceive it as the entire group misbehaving rather than a few individuals. This happens less with tourists from other countries because they don't travel in massive groups like the Chinese do.</li>
