		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are some answers from a previous asking of this question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/osmjj/when_an_organ_say_a_kidney_is_donated_what/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/osmjj/when_an_organ_say_a_kidney_is_donated_what/</a></p>
<p>Long story short, it depends on which organ we are talking about. But generally, other organs, tissue, and fluid with fill the void. </p>
<p>However, things like breast tissue or testicles will leave an obvious void, which can often be filled with a prosthetic.</p>
<p>Lung removal leaves a large void in the pleural space that is usually surgically sealed off to prevent <del>fluid build up</del> the fluid from draining. </p>
<p>Edit: Found some pictures. </p>
<p>Pre-kidney removal: <a href="http://ibimapublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/441895-f1.jpg" target="_blank">http://ibimapublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/441895-f1.jpg</a></p>
<p>Post-kidney removal: <a href="http://ibimapublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/441895-f3.jpg" target="_blank">http://ibimapublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/441895-f3.jpg</a></p>
<p>The post image is slightly superior (closer to the head) than the pre image, but shows the liver partially occupying the space previously occupied by the right kidney. </p>
<p>2nd Edit: I misremembered in the case of pneumonectomy. After the lung is removed, the goal is to prevent the fluid build up from draining. The fluid buildup helps to hold the other lung and the heart in their original position with only minimal movement. If the fluid drains, then the heart and lungs shift significantly and can cause problems with the heart and great vessels twisting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have recent experience! Donated my left kidney in 2014. I had an abdominal ultrasound last weekend for an acute problem. The ultrasound tech was curious so we poked around with the probe and everywhere my left kidney used to be was filled with intestine. And the spleen moved around a bit. My right kidney has grown a bit in the mean time.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no void. Everything shifts around.</p>
<p>Other qualifications that allow me to answer this question is being in medical school.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the abdomen, usually bowel will take up the space left behind. The lungs are a special one in that if you take out an entire lung the space fills with fluid. In other places you can get a “dent”. As a urologist, if I take out a testicle the scrotum on that side will shrivel up if we don’t put a prosthesis in its place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had an emergency surgery to remove an ovarian cyst that had twisted 3-4 times (torsion) and it had grown to 9cm. My body had a dent on that side for over a year! I gained a lot of weight and it filled in but now as I’m losing weight, if I suck in I can see that side is more concave than the other side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>most internal pieces are connected with 'connective tissue' that actually holds everything relatively still.</p>
<p>when you get surgery, the docs have to cut through this tissue to do the operation</p>
<p>some people end up growing horrific scar tissue in the void</p>
<p>some people end up with organs moving/falling into the  void</p>
<p>some *other* people end up with the scar tissue</p>
