		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common photon in our universe are the photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the afterglow from the big bang. These photons wave a wavelength of around 1 mm which our eyes cannot see. Check out Fig. 4 of this paper,</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacki, Brian C. &quot;The end of the rainbow: what can we say about the extragalactic sub-megahertz radio sky?.&quot; Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 406.2 (2010): 863-880. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2049" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2049</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you're interested in the optical band which our eyes can actually see, then the color red (~0.7 microns) is the most common color in the universe. The local peak near this wavelength though is firmly in the infrared (near 1 micron) and is referred to as the cosmic optical background (COB or CUVOB if UV is included) radiation. Check out Fig. 5 here,</p>
<ul>
<li>Pozzetti, Lucia, and Piero Madau. &quot;The optical extragalactic background light from resolved galaxies.&quot; Arxiv preprint astro-ph/0011359 (2000). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0011359v1.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0011359v1.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also the cosmic infrared (CIB), x-ray (CXB), radio (CRB) and gamma (CGB) backgrounds. These figures are looking at the aggregate background of light of the whole universe and not just nearby sources which can dominate locally.  </p>
<p>Edit1: Here's another couple page describing it,  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CIBR/" target="_blank">http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CIBR/</a>  </p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/irgalaxies/SpitzerPR2006/" target="_blank">http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/irgalaxies/SpitzerPR2006/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to note that power distribution is weighted differently than the photon number distribution and that gives quite a bit of perspective. The CMB is much more intense than the COB, but each CMB photon carries substantially less energy than optical/infrared light. If we redrew the plots (which are already in log scale) using photon number, it'd be even more lopsided.</p>
<p>Edit2: Here's a review article on the subject of CIB, but has a relatively non-technical section on the COB</p>
<ul>
<li>Hauser, Michael G., and Eli Dwek. &quot;The cosmic infrared background: measurements and implications.&quot; arXiv preprint astro-ph/0105539 (2001). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105539" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105539</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>And a neat Scientific American article on cosmic backgrounds and where they come from,  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the cosmic background, most stars are red dwarfs. Although they're very dim (you can see none by naked eye), they're numerous. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Scattered_stars_in_Sagittarius.jpg" target="_blank">This astrophotograph</a> shows what I mean. Also, when light or medium-mass stars age, they become red giants, which are bright and red. The &quot;cosmic latte&quot; is a sum of red + brighter green and blue light from bright or young stars, but the balance tilts towards red.</p>
<p>Besides that, the hydrogen alpha line from ionized hydrogen is also red. Hydrogen being common, this is a very common color in ionized gas clouds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because we can change appearances of light within the visible spectrum, which is entirely caused because of the presence of photons, to create certain colours, the absence of photons logically wouldn't really be a colour. </p>
<p>It would appear like what black is but it isn't a pigment that's causing darkness to look black, but the absence of photons itself. </p>
<p>Wouldn't you say black is my default colour of vision if  you were 100% blind, or would you rather say &quot;I do not see any colour? &quot;</p>
<p>A colour is distinctly a colour because we can differentiate it with respect to other colours. But the absence of the same does not warrant it to qualify as a colour is what I feel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know it's been a while since this and I just revisited this thought. Not to pose an argument or anything. </p>
<p>Don't you think the way we perceive anything is too linear for reality? Like scales of colour, measurement, happiness and sadness, emotion, basically everything that's relative. I feel this is a drawback in human thought as most things in reality are non-linear. We represent colour over a spectrum which is mostly linear which is why we perceive white and black as extremes. If white and black were perceived without scale and just as different combinations not representable linearly then we probably wouldn't even try to categorise the colour of emptiness and probably wouldn't call water &quot;colourless&quot;. </p>
<p>Just a thought. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
