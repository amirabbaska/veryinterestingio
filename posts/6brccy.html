		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a look <a href="https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/freeze-raw-meat-so-tastes-great-after-defrosting-0152749/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>When it comes down to it, freezing anything with water in it (which is technically everything that needs to be frozen) changes the nature of the cells. Specifically, water <em>expands</em> when frozen - this shouldn't be a surprise to most people, but what <em>should</em> surprise most people is that things generally <em>shrink</em> when frozen <strong>not</strong> expand. Water is different, and it's some of these qualities that make water so important to life.</p>
<p>Pack to the ELI5, since there's water in the cells of meat, freezing the meat tends to destroy the cells - either by rupturing them or by pulling the water <em>out</em> of the cell -dessicating it. It's one of the (several) reasons that cryogenically preserving people doesn't work - imagine that happening to your BRAIN CELLS!</p>
<p>Even if only a few cells out of a bunch get destroyed, it changes the taste. And if air can reach the meat at the same time it'll dehydrate it quicker and cause more of a change to the flavor - check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezer_burn" target="_blank">freezer burn</a> for some more info.</p>
<p>edit - really cool freezing fact: some animals can survive deep cold by partially freezing. In the case of the <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/21/how-the-alaska-wood-frog-survives-being-frozen/" target="_blank">wood frogs</a> they use aptly named &quot;cryoprotectants&quot; to <em>lower</em> the freezing point of the cells in the body, reducing the formation of ice etc.etc. They also slow/suspend many bodily functions so that they don't need ...well... anything. Cool stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slow freezing cells creates big water crystals that can puncture cell walls.   When thawed, the contents of cell walls leak out, leaving a shell and a mess on the floor.  Macroscopically, this leads to mushiness.  Taste, which is the contents of the cells, is greatly leaked out.</p>
<p>Flash freezing creates smaller water crystals and drastically reduces adverse effects.   All your seafood is flash frozen unless it's you pick the lobster at restaurant type.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know anything about food science, but when I think of frozen burger patties, I think of bland tasting freezer-burn coated cheap meat. When I hear Wendy's motto and learn that their meat is never frozen, in my mind, I don't imagine it having that freezer-burn taste or going through all that destructive freezing, so I think that the burgers will taste better.</p>
<p>My lack of expertise should stop you from being convinced by anything I say, but since I'm probably the target market for that sort of slogan, you might be able to infer a lot from my thoughts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of the science mumbo-jumbo other have pointed out, making this claim in the US has a bit of wiggle room. I know this, because I worked in a grocery store in high school that also makes the &quot;never frozen&quot; claim. You don't have to call something 'frozen' as long as it's never stored below 0 degrees F. However, at what temp does water freeze? 32F. So as long as you store the meat/whatever low enough to actually freeze but not go below 0 you can make the &quot;fresh, never frozen&quot; claim.</p>
<p>Now, this was early 2000s, so things may have changed in the 2 decades since but the grocery chain still has it in their ad campaign </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frozen beef can last a lot longer than refrigerated. Patties can be formed and frozen for months at end, and with the right marketing, it can seem very unappetizing to eat &quot;old&quot; meat, even if it's perfectly safe. There can also be degradation of quality with having meat frozen and thawed.</p>
<p>Saying your meat is &quot;fresh, never frozen&quot; makes people feel like the company uses high-quality ingredients, with more care in the product that they're selling. Is it true? Well... probably not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
