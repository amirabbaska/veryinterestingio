		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything from ground service, to in flight food, how can an economic powerhouse like the US have such universally poor quality airlines? (Certainly I'm not talking about safety.)</p>
<p>I don't see any US-based carriers on this list of top airlines:</p>
<p>ANA All Nippon Airways</p>
<p>Asiana Airlines</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific Airways</p>
<p>Emirates</p>
<p>Etihad Airways</p>
<p>EVA Air</p>
<p>Garuda Indonesia</p>
<p>Hainan Airlines</p>
<p>Japan Airlines</p>
<p>Korean Air</p>
<p>Lufthansa</p>
<p>Qantas Airways</p>
<p>Qatar Airways</p>
<p>Singapore Airlines</p>
<p>Swiss</p>
<p>Thai Airways</p>
<p>Turkish Airlines</p>
<p>EDIT: I wanted to add 2 cents from Gary Leff:</p>
<p>&quot;What I desperately wish I could remember is which of these books it was where I read extensively on United Airlines President Pat Patterson. Patterson had been the Wells Fargo loan officer who authorized funding for Pacific Air Transport, later acquired by Boeing Air Transport, which was ultimate merged in with other carriers to become United Air Lines. Patterson moved over to Boeing and then to United, becoming General Manager and ultimately President of the airline.</p>
<p>While he’s perhaps best known for approving the hiring of in-flight nurses which morphed into onboard flight attendants, he’s also more than any other, the man who brought union control into the operation of the airline business. The version of the story I recall is that he believed that the unions were closer to their workers, and better understood their needs, than management was. It wasn’t just a matter of collective bargaining, but deeply held belief, that the workers would be better off (and that this would benefit the airline) if unions and union procedures handled scheduling.</p>
<p>I’m not a scholar in this area by any means, but the shift from company control over its employees to union control — and from management evaluation of employees to roles and responsibilities determined by seniority — has consequences which reverberate across the industry today.</p>
<p>Great flight attendants provide great service because they’re proud to do so, because they’re driven to do so, internally. In some ways the exceptional US flight attendant deserves much more praise because they are doing it on their own, when there is little if any benefit to them to do so. They aren’t going to lose their job as a result of occasionally grumpy and often lackluster service. They aren’t going to get paid more for going above and beyond for a customer. They do it because they’re internally driven and believe it’s the right thing to do. I truly thank them and honor them.</p>
<p>But as long as scheduling is done by seniority, and pay is doled out by route, and as long as commendations and criticisms are only ancillary to performance evaluations, pay, and perks, airlines aren’t going to be able to align the incentives of their frontline workforce to deliver outstanding service.</p>
<p>It isn’t all institutions, and it isn’t all culture, but the two of them combine so that superior companies drawing on service cultures and fostering those cultures can provide a superior experience. Mediocre companies drawing on a service culture will offer good and bad, just as companies here in the US without strong service institutions will occasionally offer flashes of brilliance (but often ‘good enough’). And in most cases I don’t expect either the cultures or the institutions to change very much.&quot;</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good number (but not all) of those airlines are subsidised by their government for political/ prestige/ strategic reasons, so a $100 ticket buys you $150 of product. Emirates/ Eithad/ Qatar especially don't have business models that would survive without outside money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when you are in Japan/Singapore/Qatar/Korea/etc, and you are getting on an airplane, you are far more likely travelling internationally than if you are an American, who's more often than not getting on a domestic flight, even for only a few hundred miles.  </p>
<p>International flights are always different than domestic ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airline passengers in the US have voted with their wallets and demonstrated that when they are paying for their own ticket, all they care about is price. The only people willing to pay for a premium flight experience are people spending someone else's money.</p>
<p>Second, US airlines are heavily built around their domestic routes. International operations are an entirely different market with different service standards.</p>
<p>To put some numbers to this, as of a couple years ago, American Airlines saw half of its revenue come from the 87% of its customers who flew the airline only once that year. When looking at their fortress hub in Dallas-Fort Worth, they don't see their competition as United or Delta, but rather ultra-budget airline Spirit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it comes down to price. Kiwi.com <a href="https://www.kiwi.com/stories/flight-price-index-2017/usd/" target="_blank">ranks countries by average flight costs per kilometer</a>. In the US, we're about halfway down the list at an average of $11.50.</p>
<p>That puts is two slots above China, which isn't exactly known for expensive prices. That's because in the US, a lot of people fly to and from work in coach. People generally want the cheapest flight possible, even if they end up with a bad experience.</p>
<p>By comparison, I've been told that flying in Japan is more of a luxury. When a good experience is more important than cost, you end up with more enjoyable flights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
