		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Psychology Today: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201108/bear-kills-son-and-herself-chinese-bear-farm" target="_blank">Chinese media has reported that a captive bear on a Chinese bear farm killed her son and then herself after she heard him cry out in pain when a catheter was jammed into his abdomen so that bile could be extracted from his gallbladder for human medicinal purposes. Around 14,000 bears are kept in horrific conditions and routinely tortured on Chinese bear farms. In this case &quot;a mother bear reportedly broke free after hearing her cub's cry, causing 'farmers' to run away in fear. She then ran to the cub's side and immediately smothered it, then ran headlong into a wall and killed herself instantly</a></p>
<p>Edit: I'm seeing a lot of comments from people rightfully horrified by the medicinal practice mentioned in the article. I would like us to keep in mind that &quot;we're&quot; viewing &quot;their&quot; actions and behaviors from a Western viewpoint, which is incredibly problematic. It's not necessarily a case of civility and development as some have suggested, but traditional culture. Westerners do some horrific things as well, which I suspect would receive equally horrified responses from readers. I did not post the original comment/link to article to demonstrate the cruelty visited upon animals in China or to demonize Chinese peoples and practices carried out by a small fraction of the population. My intention was to provide an answer to the OP and bring attention to the fact that these practices do exist. One must only look to our own beef/chicken/whathaveyou production to feel sickened at how &quot;we&quot; treat our own animals. Let's not turn this into and us/them discussion, but work toward ending practices that involve incredible cruelty worldwide. </p>
<p>Edit 2: As I replied to another poster: &quot;it doesn't make the practice 'less fucked up.' I felt the need to add the edit due to some truly polarizing and ethnocentric comments that don't contribute to the actual conversation.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Penguins have also been known to commit suicide.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/x7kdDeGXUjI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/x7kdDeGXUjI</a></p>
<p>On a personal note: we had only two swans in our entire town among the ducks and geese, they were iconic in our little Podunk nowhere. They groomed one another, would pose for cameras and feed from crumbs given to them. (Really well behaved for animals that have been known to attack sometimes)</p>
<p>One year everything changed, a rogue male appeared from seemingly no where; this resulted in the female leaving her mate for this newcomer. Anyone who says animals don't experience depression never met the lonely mate. He stopped eating, his feathers became dingy, some missing and he would only float atop the water in a nasty little ditch next to the Chinese restaurant. It wasn't long before he was found dead, presumably from hunger.</p>
<p>This came as a huge shock to me as a child, I had no idea at the time that animals that were supposedly &quot;mate for life&quot; could do anything but, and nor did I grasp that he successfully committed suicide until a few years later when I could reflect in some obtained maturity. It was horribly depressing watching that unfold and realizing that animals face pain similarly to what we do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years back my childhood dog passed away, she was getting very old and had a limited time left. </p>
<p>I didn't know this till a few months ago, but the day she passed my mom was in the kitchen, watching the dog walk around the backyard like she did every day. Due to her health, she hadn't gone swimming in a couple years; she had fallen in a few times, but it was very apparent she couldn't swim anymore. She did everything she could to avoid the water. But on that day, my mom said she watched her calmly walk into the pool by the steps, swim out a few feet, and sank without a twitch or struggle.</p>
<p>I believe that she was in so much pain, she knew it was her time to go. She decided to do so peacefully in the water that she loved so dearly when she was a pup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins have been documented killing themselves on many occasions. Unlike humans, dolphins have to consciously take every breath. As a human, if you try to hold your breath, there's an instinctive reaction that will eventually force you to breath. Dolphins don't have this. They'll swim down and just slowly nod off as their brain loses oxygen. The man who made the series Flipper is on record saying that one of the dolphins used on the show swam into his arms, looked him in the eyes, and then stopped breathing and died there. It caused him to rethink everything he did and made making Flipper one of his biggest life regrets. He went on to make a documentary called The Cove. It's about an annual dolphin slaughter in Japan. It's really really good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
