		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is based on a false premise; the common misconception that being a silverback is the product of being dominant in a group of gorillas. </p>
<p>Any family group of gorillas will have only one silverback. However, that is because there will be only one fully adult male gorilla in a group. The high crest and silver back, are secondary gender characteristics that develop in all fully adult male gorillas. </p>
<p>When a male gorilla gets into late adolescence he will challenge the dominant male for control of the group and get kicked out as a result. He will then be on his own, or join a bachelor group, until he is big and strong enough to get his own females.  <a href="http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/gorilla/behav" target="_blank">http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/gorilla/behav</a></p>
<p>I'll also point out that orangutans are a solitary animal, and I do not see how their cheek flanges would be related to dominance. I don't disagree with the post that says the size of cheek flanges is related to testosterone, but that is not necessarily related to dominance.  <a href="http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/orangutan/behav" target="_blank">http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/orangutan/behav</a></p>
<p>There are primates where dominance and appearance are related. Mandrills, a kind of baboon, do have dominance related secondary sex characteristics. The dominant males will have more testosterone, more colour and bigger balls. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11424076" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11424076</a> I don't think we're clear on the mechanism, that is, why the dominant males will have more testosterone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I can't answer what causes the physical change in silverback gorillas, I can answer that it does happen in other primates. Orangutan males will develop flanges, however not all orangutans develop flanges. It seems that the more dominant ones develop the flanges and that the females prefer mating with the flanged males. Here's a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.22453/abstract;jsessionid=C93407680456AF0966CE2CB7842A836A.f03t04?systemMessage=Pay+per+view+article+purchase%28PPV%29+on+Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+11th+March+from+05%3A00-14%3A00+GMT+%2F+12%3A00-09%3A00+EST+%2F+13%3A00-22%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience." target="_blank">study</a> that was held and found that a higher level of testosterone was found in the flanged males, possibly causing the change. There's also this <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151027-new-insights-into-strange-faced-orangutans" target="_blank">article</a> by BBC earth that explains a little bit more about orangutan flanges and how the flanged males differ from unflanges males. I would like to mention that while that study did find that flanged orangutans did have higher testosterone level, they were not stating that those levels were the cause of the flanges. They are not entirely certain what causes flanges. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
