		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My sister told me a long time ago that dirt is the enemy of suds and that stuck with me.  But it's basically true.  Your hair has oils that are important to its structure.  Those oils allow dirt to cling to it.  Shampooing strips away those oils and thus the dirt.  but remember dirt is the enemy of suds so you won't lather up the first time you do it.  That's partially why shampoo instructions say to do it twice, to waste more product and to make sure your hair is actually clean.  The second one will probably lather up considerably.  Alternatively if you wash your hair too much it will always lather but you are doing considerable damage to your hair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant" target="_blank">Surfactants</a> are the active ingredients in cleansers, lowering the surface tension between two liquids or a liquid and a solid (e.g. water and hair oils); allowing it to be rinsed away.</p>
<p>The more dirt in your hair, the more the surfactants get bound (&quot;used up&quot;) and the fewer are available for further cleansing and/or foaming (as free surfactants in the water will cause soap bubbles to form which you experience as lather).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most soaps are surfactants - molecules that bind to and break up greasy/fatty substances.  Water and greasy (or hydrophillic) molecules do not want to mix.  In the case of your hair not being washed for a while, it's covered with grease.  Water alone is poor at removing it since they repel each other.  </p>
<p>A surfactant molecule is a hybrid.  Part of it is hydrophillic - water loving.   The rest of it is hydrophobic like grease.  This <a href="http://www.cesio.eu/images/content/special-molecular-structure.jpg" target="_blank">diagram</a> shows how it works.  The red dots are the charged, hydrophillic parts of the surfactant molecules.  The yellow stalks are the uncharged, hydrophobic tails of the surfactant molecules.  When these surfactants mix with greasy substances, the surfactant molecules can bind to both the water molecules as well as the grease, allowing the grease to be broken up into tiny bits and dissolved in the water.</p>
<p>Surfactants by themselves are really good at making bubbles.  Air can generally be considered to be hydrophobic and so when you mix a lot of air into surfactant-containing water, you get thin layers of water, surrounded by a coating of the surfactant molecules, all pointing tail end into the air on both sides of the soap film as shown <a href="http://www.clearbiology.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Lipid-Vesicle-vs-Soap-Bubble.png" target="_blank">here</a>.  (incidentally, the lipid vesicle shown in the right half of the diagram is basically how cell membranes work)</p>
<p>So, when your hair is really greasy, most of the surfactant molecules get used up dissolving all that grease.  That leaves little to no surfactant to make sudsy soap bubbles.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
