		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, you're looking at everything beyond the rising air through a really crappy lens that distorts everything in tiny ways and changes from moment to moment.</p>
<p>Like all &quot;transparent&quot; things, air bends light passing through it as the light enters and leaves it at an angle. Moving from air at one density to air at another has the same effect. Hot air (like that coming off the top of a radiator or a hot road) rises and makes the air density turbulent and uneven.</p>
<p>So say you're looking at something - your cat's nose, maybe - and the light gets bent. Some of the light that reaches you, originally started out in a slightly different direction - passing you to your right, say. Along the line it got turned a little to IT'S right, and hit your eye. So, from your viewpoint, the path it actually came along looks something like a dog-leg (cat-leg?) to the left. But - your eye and brain can work out the final direction it came from, but have no way of telling that the light it was bent along the way; effectively, you just draw a straight line back along whatever final direction it came from, and say &quot;over THERE&quot;. And &quot;there&quot; is wrong; it looks as though the light came from slightly further right than it actually did.</p>
<p>Multiply that up over lots of different densities caused by the heat ripples in the air, and the image you see is all there, but bent very slightly all over the place, in lots of different ways. Add in the fact that the hot air isn't rising remotely smoothly, so the distortion changes from moment to moment. And THAT's the shimmering you see.</p>
<p>Or if you're thinking of, say, the shadows that sunlight shining through hot air can make on a wall - same effect; the air's getting bent all over the place. Some parts of the wall end up with more, some with less, so you get lighter and darker zones. And as the air moves, so do the zones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's actually not altering our <em>perception</em> but our <em>sensation</em> of the light, and only indirectly - because the light actually is coming to us in that wavy effect.  Others are explaining why that part happens (light bends as it passes through different densities, and when pressure is held constant, higher temperature air will have lower density).</p>
<p>Sensation vs perception though is the difference between what stimuli hit our sensors vs how our brain interprets the sensation of those stimuli.</p>
<p>So, our sensation of the light becomes wavy, but that's because the light is actually coming through wavy because of refraction - the light actually is bent by the different-temperature air.  Our <em>perception</em> of that light is the image which forms (which actually lives at the back of your brain) and that isn't being messed with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat changes the refractive index of air (due to expansion), and as currents and eddies of air pass through a heater – or over a desert – there's an uneven heating effect, causing slight but visible waves of differing refraction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light can change direction when going from one material to another. The air that is heated is rising up in currents through the colder air. This hot air is considered a different material to the colder air and so bends the light. As the currents move about the bent light moves as well giving the wavy effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
