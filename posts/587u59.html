The bigger worry was that the bombs wouldn't explode at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that to create a nuclear explosion, you need <em>exquisite</em> timing.  A careful explosion coming in from all directions.  Here's why:</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2fusf8/til_in_1972_a_pocket_of_uranium_in_africa_was/ckd7ufj" target="_blank">this ELI5</a> post for a general explanation on what radioactivity is, what the chain-reaction is, and what is done to make power plants and bombs.</p>
<p>If you feel well-enough grounded on that, onto step two:</p>
<p>In order to get a bomb, you need to make <em>lots</em> of atoms split apart.  There is a chain reaction going on - one splitting fires off a bunch of neutrons that hit other atoms and make them split, each which make more split - so that's really helpful. It's an exponential process.</p>
<p>The problem is how far apart the atoms are.  If they're too far apart, a lot of neutrons just won't hit any atoms, and the chain reaction will die out.</p>
<p>So in order to get a <em>lot</em> of atoms to split apart, we need a big core (more fissile material so it's more likely to catch a neutron before it flies outside of the targets) and we need to <em>force</em> the atoms to be really close together, so the neutrons are more likely to hit each other.</p>
<p>Now, if we keep the core small enough (or keep it in smaller pieces before the bomb is fully assembled), we're not going to get a lot of radioactivity.  So it can't possibly explode.  That's safety for working on the device.</p>
<p>Part 2 of safety is what keeps the bomb from going off accidentally once its fully assembled.</p>
<p>If you ever get enough material close enough together, it will start to produce energy.  If it's <em>really</em> close, it will start generating <em>a lot</em> of energy.</p>
<p>But what happens then?  The massive amount of energy and heat will make the core blow itself apart, and then the chain reaction will stop because there's no longer a large concentration.  The reaction will stop before any large explosion occurs.</p>
<p>The only way we can get the massive kilo-ton explosions is if we <em>forcibly</em> hold the core together against its own explosion, keeping it in tact and in close proximity long enough to get a lot more atoms to split.</p>
<p>And what better way to counter an explosion than with a bigger explosion?  <em>Nothing, that's what!</em></p>
<p>So to actually activate a nuclear bomb, a <em>super carefully timed</em> set of explosions surrounding a hollow-sphere of uranium or plutonium all detonated at <em>exactly the same time</em> and this crushes the core together and creates enough pressure to hold it together for several microsconds, rather than the nanoseconds it would stay together without the pressure of the explosions.</p>
<p>Now, a few milliseconds might sound irrelevant, but remember this is an <em>exponential</em> process.  One split makes two more split, makes two more split, etc.  Just a little extra time on an exponential function can make an explosions tens, hundreds, thousands, or <em>millions</em> of times more explosive.</p>
<p>So, if we leave a nuke in a warehouse full of grenades, and then we toss a live grenade in there, things will start blowing up randomly.  Maybe even the conventional explosives inside the nuclear bomb will go off.  But they won't all go off at the same time.  So they'll just hit the core from one side, and probably blow it to pieces instead of universally crushing it from all sides.  It'll fly apart and never start to split any significant number of atoms.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
Detonating a nuclear bomb is hard, because you have to crush it evenly and simultaneously from all sides using <em>very</em> carefully timed explosions.  If the explosions don't all go off at exactly the same time, the nuclear material won't be crushed together, and it won't achieve any significant amounts of nuclear activity.</p>
<p>Any random explosions or perturbations <em>could</em> detonate some of the explosives, but it won't have a ghost of a chance of detonating them perfectly all at once, so it's actually really safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of my favorite things in the world to talk about. This will take a while.</p>
<p>Nuclear Fission releases energy when an atom changes its nuclear configuration (its number of protons/neutrons). In doing so it releases a neutron (which will be important later), but (because mass is weird), the total mass of the resulting atom and released particles is less than the mass of the original atom. This lost mass is released as energy, and it's a <em>lot</em> of energy for the amount of mass. We're still talking about a tiny percentage of an atom, so a single atom fissioning doesn't do much, but get a lot of them to and you get an amazing amount of heat.</p>
<p>Fission from Uranium/Plutonium happens in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Decay</strong>: These elements are unstable, and will occasionally decay on their own. Uranium has always been doing this, and the fissile Uranium in the world has been gradually &quot;running out&quot; longer than the lifetime of the earth. Plutonium does it so quickly that it doesn't even exist in nature anymore, and we have to make it ourselves. Spontaneous decay (even in plutonium) is so slow that it doesn't do much on its own; it's safe-ish to handle even bomb-quantities of plutonium, so long as the second two factors aren't at play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prompt Decay from Neutron Colissions</strong> When a neutron from another fission action hits an atom, it can &quot;knock it apart&quot;, more or less, causing it to instantly fission. In the case of Uranium/Plutonium, this can release multiple further neutrons.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Delayed Decay of Fission Products</strong> Many of the things resulting from Uranium/Plutonium decay are themselves super unstable, much more than plutonium. They decay with a half-life of seconds or minutes in some cases, releasing further energy and neutrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in a nuclear assembly (bomb, reactor, whatever), what matters is the number of neutrons, and how that number changes. Neutrons are added by spontaneous fisson and reaction, and lost by just flying out of the system without hitting anything interesting (also absorption, but we don't care about that for this context).</p>
<p>This gets us to five very important terms: Sub-Critical, Critical, Super-Critical, Hyper-Critical and Prompt Critical.</p>
<p>Crtiticality refers to how many neutrons a neutron added to the system is likely to &quot;spawn&quot; through the second two types of fission I mentioned above. In this case, we consider neutrons from spontaneous absorption to be &quot;added&quot; to the system, as if they were external. If one neutron is likely to ultimately result in exactly one further netron before it leaves/is absorbed, then the assembly is exactly <strong>critical</strong>: it will stay at whatever level of heat/neutron production it's at, forever, assuming no external neutrons are added. If the expected result is less than one neutron, it's <strong>sub-critical</strong> and will gradually lose neutrons and cool down to a very low rate determined almost soley by spontaneous fission. If it's more than one, it's <strong>super-critical</strong>.</p>
<p>A super-critical assembly will produce exponentially more and more neutrons and heat, until either it consumes all of its fuel (which would take a while), or more likely, something stops it. If no human controls are in place, then it stops when it melts into a non-critical configuration, because <strong>shape really matters.</strong></p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned that neutrons leave the system by, well, leaving without hitting anything? The chance that they do that has to do with the ratio of mass to surface area. If the mass is very spread out, or has a lot of surface area, it's easy for neutrons to leave the system without reacting. </p>
<p>So, we have all the terminology we need to describe a basic nuclear reactor: controls are used to alter its criticallity to bring it up to super-critical until it's at the desired heat production, then level it off at critical. (Actually staying exactly at critical is impossible, but it will wobble back and forth guided by either control rods or physical feedback loops.)</p>
<p>For a nuclear bomb, though, you want to release a lot more energy, very fast: You want a runaway reaction that doesn't melt and shut itself down, because it doesn't have time. This brings us to the next two pieces of terminology:</p>
<p><strong>Hyper-Critical</strong> just means like, way supercritical. A normal supercritical system might produce like, 1.2 neutrons for each neutron added. A hyper-critical system produces hundreds.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt Critical</strong> is much more interesting: It means that the system is critical enough that <strong>it does not need the delayed fission neutrons to be critical</strong>. This means that, rather than having an exponential curve built by the seconds or minutes it takes things things to decay, you have one built by the time it takes neutrons traveling at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light to cross the radius of a bomb core.</p>
<p>So, to wrap up quickly, why bombs are safe: Because in order to get a nuclear blast, you have to take something that is sub-crtical, and bring it to prompt-hyper-critical before it has a chance to melt. That's actually very difficult to do; almost everything but the Little Boy Hiroshima assembly bomb does it by using an explosive shell to compress the fissile material inwards into a super-compressed bead with very little surface area. Doing this actually involves making &quot;lenses&quot; of fast and slow explosives in the shell, so that a perfect inwarldly-moving sphere of a blast way may be approximated by multiple simultaneous ignition points.</p>
<p>It's really hard to do on purpose, and basically impossible to do by accident. You can melt your assembly and kill yourself with radiation (no one's melted working on a bomb, but a few people have died), but you can't actually blow up the lab on accident.</p>
<p>EDIT: Fun fact, for anyone who made it this far. To my (pretty decent, if I do say so myself) knoweldge, there has been exactly one occasion on which a nuclear assembly has been shut down by being allowed to run wild until it melted into a non-critical configuration. That was at Chernobyl. To make matters worse, the Russiand had placed their reactor directly above a giant tank of water, so when the tens-of-thousands-of-degrees hot molted uranium hit that, it caused a steam explosion that was directed upwards through the remains of the reactor. Chernobyl was a steam-powered nuclear shotgun pointed at the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have covered nuclear explosives well, but you did say simply &quot;bombs,&quot; so I'll talk just a touch about conventional explosives.</p>
<p>Basically, most conventional explosives, for both commercial and military use, are designed in such a way that they're actually rather stable until some kind of detonator/fuse/blasting cap - electrical, chemical, or mechanical - sets the explosive off. C4, famously, can be set on fire, shot with a gun, dropped, deformed, manhandled, and generally abused without ever detonating. In order to actually set off C4, you need to insert a detonator and use that.</p>
<p>A detonator is basically a very, very small bomb that's used to set off the actual bomb. Think of it like a little firecracker you stick into the bomb to set off the bomb. They <em>are</em> much easier to set off, so you have to be a lot more careful with detonators than you are with your bombs, but the upside is that a detonator exploding prematurely might give one dude a nasty injury rather than level half of the town like having a half-ton of whatever explosive you're carrying around going off would.</p>
<p>Some explosives can also be set off electrically without any sort of primary explosive either - simply running an electric charge through the material will start the reaction.</p>
<p>Before this, we were stuck using explosives like nitroglycerine and gunpowder which are very, very unstable (and actually less powerful anyway). Gunpowder, for example, will burn very rapidly under all sorts of conditions, and in fact doesn't even require oxygen to burn since it has both its fuel <em>and</em> its oxidizer (so yes, guns actually work just fine in space). Nitroglycerine is even less stable - in its pure form, it'll just straight up blow the fuck up if, say, you just dropped it on the floor. Not only that, but after it's manufactured, it degrades into even more unstable compounds over time. It's even fucking liquid! You can spill it on the ground and suddenly you just blew everything up. Well, except for the fact that its freezing point is 13 degrees C, and when it's frozen, it's somehow even more unstable.</p>
<p>Nitroglycerine was eventually made into dynamite by Alfred Nobel (yes, like the Nobel Prize) as a means of making it safer and more stable. Instead of blowing up when you just drop it on the ground, now you need some kind of fuse. And from there, we got to stable high explosives that can be set on fire and shot without exploding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot of discussion about whether the radioactive material would suddenly explode. The answer is &quot;no, not really&quot; though there have been instances where two pieces have been accidentally smashed together and killed people with a brief burst of radiation as a result.</p>
<p>The main issue was with the bomb itself detonating. There are many ways the explosives can go off to set off the reaction. A fire was a worry, as was shock by hitting or dropping the thing, accidental activation, electrical shorts, and many other things.</p>
<p>Each of those potential things happened at once point or another, and it was often due to safety improvements or sheer luck that they didn't detonate. One of the main improvements was the aim to make bombs &quot;one point safe,&quot; where if the high explosives at one point went off (through fire, shock, etc.) then the design was such that it wouldn't be sufficient to start a bomb. Indeed, there were instances where the high explosives did go off, spewing the core around the place, but not causing a nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most memorable facepalm moment was when a bomber crewman went to steady himself during turbulence by grabbing the release hook in the bomb bay, and released a bomb which went crashing through the doors to the ground below. They later found that all but one safety mechanism was either disabled, or hadn't functioned properly.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this, there's a great book called Command and Control which talks about the efforts to secure the US nuke arsenal in these ways. There's also a film to be released based upon one of the main incidents in the book.</p>
<p>All of this does add weight to arguments why many countries shouldn't gain nukes. It's not nessessarily that we think they'll want to view their use in the right way, but also that their infrastructure and procedural/technical knowledge is pretty much at square one when it comes to preventing nuclear accidents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
