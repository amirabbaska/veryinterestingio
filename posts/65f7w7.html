		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/whrlassekgaulin2008.pdf" target="_blank">Gluteofemoral fat</a> is actually strongly correlated with quality, and somewhat correlated with quantity, of breastmilk. The findings in the study linked show that the particular kind of fatty chains stored in big booties are particularly nourishing to neonatal brains, and that woman with an ideal WHR (waist-hip ratio; basically that hourglass figure that women strive to have) has more neuro-developmental resources to offer her infant. </p>
<p>Breasts do grow in size somewhat during pregnancy because the milk ducts are filling with colostrum, the &quot;first milk&quot; that women produce. It's incredibly calorie, fat, and nutrient dense, and a middling yellow in colour, as opposed to the more traditional whitish milk needed by more mature infants (past the first week or so). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, breast size is more to do with displaying age than anything else. <a href="http://content.iospress.com/articles/technology-and-health-care/thc00471" target="_blank">Larger breasts are more easily identified as &quot;old&quot;</a> than smaller ones. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595000023" target="_blank">This helps men identify fertile females</a>, hence the mild preference for larger breasts.</p>
<p>The breast size has little to do with milk production or even energy reserves, but was sexually selected for as a measure of youth and fecundity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many people have already pointed out, breast size does not correlate to milk production.  A woman's breasts (non-pregnant, non-nursing) are basically entirely fat tissue.  The actual glandular tissue doesn't start to hypertrophy until prolactin levels rise during pregnancy.  That is why they grow, but the size prior to prolactin has nothing to do with milk production.  Interestingly, humans are some of the only mammals that develop and maintain breast tissue in the absence of lactation. Breasts form initially in response to the elevating estrogen levels of puberty and are considered a secondary sex characteristic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
