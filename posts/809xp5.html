		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;second wind&quot; is typically your body releasing a stress hormone called Cortisol, triggered by a stress like lack of sleep, overexertion, etc. </p>
<p>Cortisol does 2 primary things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Releases your stored glucose, or robs some protein from your muscles to convert into glucose if you have not eaten adequately, in order to raise your blood sugar levels so your muscles have fast energy available.</p>
</li>
<li>Pushes blood through the body more quickly by restricting the arteries and raising your heart rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These give you the feeling of a &quot;second wind&quot;, allowing your body to manage the physical stress you are putting on it (fight or flight).</p>
<p>This response is fine and not bad by itself, but the problems come when you don't deal with the stress and let your body rest properly, and end up damaging your body by keeping that negative feedback loop going so that it remains in a constant state of high blood sugar and/or high blood pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 4 major &quot;gears&quot; in the body, like a car. Phospho creatine system is like first gear and the reason you can sprint/fight/push for 6-15 seconds without any pain or major effort. Second gear is your aerobic system, this gear gives out quick if you hit it coming from fist gear, and bounces you to third/fourth gear--which are different types of anaerobic metabolism. These are the gears you coast in during exertion, and can only play with them for so long before pains/fatigues/certain bodily build ups force you to drop down a gear or stop altogether.</p>
<p>Now, with a second wind you can imagine that all these gears have different tanks of gas, and as you lean on one system or another, the others are being replenished. This bouncing is a type of second wind. This is why different types of athletes focus on explosiveness, sustain or somewhere in the middle during training. Combine that with with different neurotransmissions that release substances that cause excitement, euphoria and kill pain. .and you get ebs and flows of second winds!</p>
<p>And sorry if you meant about being sleepy. I don't know too much about sleep cycles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Some scientists believe the second wind to be a result of the body finding the proper balance of oxygen to counteract the buildup of lactic acid in the muscles.[2] Others claim second winds are due to endorphin production.</p>
<p>Heavy breathing during exercise is also to provide cooling for the body. After some time the veins and capillaries dilate and cooling takes place more through the skin, so less heavy breathing is needed. The increase in the temperature of the skin can be felt at the same time as the &quot;second wind&quot; takes place.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was taught in my HS Anatomy and Physiology class that your first wind is your body using anaerobic processes to fuel your activity. Anaerobic processes are readily available and allow for more powerful, short bursts of energy; however you deplete these sources fairly fast.</p>
<p>Your second wind is your body’s aerobic processes taking over; or at least tipping the balance of anaerobic to aerobic to enable sustained energy output with minimal muscle fatigue. Aerobic processes can last longer once your body is warmed up and “settled in” to the exercise you are doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your body's ability to produce energy has a momentum-like effect. The process of going from a relatively energy-efficient, low power consumption mode into a mode that is able to quickly convert stored glycogen and other bodily compounds into quick energy takes time to ramp up to full speed.</p>
<p>If you're relatively relaxed or just warmed up but still fresh, your body still isn't in full energy-burn mode. Once you leap into action, your body starts that transition. If you get winded and take a break, that process doesn't immediately slow down, so after a moment or two, your energy suddenly surges because your body is still supplying the energy level you were demanding of it a few moments ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
