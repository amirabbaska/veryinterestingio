		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Supreme Court has ruled a couple of times in theory that gerrymandering for partisan political purposes is illegal, but pretty much every justice in the majority had a different written opinion, and different test for a lower court to use to determine if partisan gerrymandering occured, making partisan gerrymandering cases virtually non justiciable, because there's no real guidance for a court to use. Gerrymandering for racial reasons has more case law and is more likely to be thrown out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that most of the comments here are in error. The prior Supreme Court cases have not ever found that partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional, quite the contrary. The only reason that the Supreme Court has found for overturning district gerrymandering is for racial reasons, and even then they are of two minds. </p>
<p>Consider a state that is 60% white and 40% black. What should the legislature of that state look like? If the two populations are evenly mixed, then every district will be predominantly white and they could very well end up with an all white state congress. On the other hand if there were some all white districts and some all black districts and the districts all had the same population, then the most likely outcome would be a 40% black and 60% white congress. Which is the most racially unbiased result? </p>
<p>So, gerrymandering is sometimes used to increase minority race representation in congress and sometimes it is used to decrease it. The Supreme Court generally finds as you might expect in those cases. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if a gerrymandering case is brought to the court that doesn't have a racial component, they have generally not heard the case, since there is precedent that partisan gerrymandering is not illegal. There is no obvious part of the Constitution that it violates. Sometimes a case might be partisan or it might be racial and they will hear those cases. </p>
<p>Some states have laws against partisan gerrymandering, which changes things. And it appears that public opinion on the matter might be changing which is forcing the SCOTUS to be willing to reexamine this precedent. For the first time in a long time the SCOTUS is going to rule on a case of strictly partisan gerrymandering this year. </p>
<p>TL;DR: partisan gerrymandering is mostly legal, but that may be changing, both at the state and federal levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a difficult thing to manage.  As a result of a Supreme Court ruling in regards to civil rights the states are not allowed to spread minority votes across district lines since it was determined that that doesn't give them a strong enough voice and doesn't allow them a united voice as well as the advancement of minority politicians in Congress.  The court actually requires states to intentionally create districts that have a majority population of minorities.</p>
<p>States largely complied.  But, as time has gone on people often believe that giving minorities their own districts actually hurts their political power because states put them all in their district, they get one politician and then the rest of the districts aren't a melting pot.  So now there is a push to try to prevent states from districting based on racial lines, but the Supreme Court has already required them to do this.  So it's a very fine balancing act the states have to go through, and in many cases they exploit the Supreme Court requirements/ruling to their political advantage.</p>
<p>And if you removed the racial districting you might actually lose minority representation in Congress in terms of number of minority Congressmen, which people don't want.  So gerrymandering is this strange mix of affirmative action for Congress and political gamesmanship to protect a party's numbers in Congress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what state you live in, it is legal to protect the incumbent party, so, quite a bit of gerrymandering IS legal if you use that as the defense.
And the federal courts have upheld this, I should add.
Here's the relevant Wikipedia source, if you'll accept this:</p>
<p>Other states including California, New Jersey and New York have opted to protect incumbents of both parties, again reducing the number of competitive districts. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Pennsylvania gerrymander[5] effectively cemented the right of elected officials to select their constituents by eliminating most of the grounds for disenfranchised constituents to challenge gerrymandered lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no clearly correct way to draw political districts, and any potential map is going to confer some sort of political advantage.</p>
<p>You also have shady agreements between the parties, a congressman might be ok with a safe district that gives them a job for life even if the map doesn't favor their party.</p>
<p>Finally, in some states there are federal court orders dictating there be majority districts for various ethnic groups.  Complying with those sometimes decades old orders in the face of popular shifts can make for a challenging map.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
