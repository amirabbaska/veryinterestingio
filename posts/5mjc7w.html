		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically what I'm asking is why bother having so many different strong opiates if they all have very, very similar profiles? </p>
<p>Besides duration, and the ceiling of the painkilling effects (i.e. codeine vs. morphine), the differences are very slight between these drugs. In fact I believe only morphine makes the WHO's list of essential medicines for a healthcare system. Why bother stocking all the rest? </p>
<p>Edit:To add to this, I'm mostly interested in what, if any, implications the often slight alterations in morphine's analogues have that make them more desirable than morphine itself. Primarily I'm interested in how these small changes effect a drug's structure-activity relationship. Opiates are really just an ideal example I picked, if you know something regarding this in other kinds of drugs, that's also of help.</p>
<p>I am aware of the following points: Pharma pressures doctors to use new but not very innovative products, and that doctors like to rotate a person's pain medication to reduce tolerance effects.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are some differences within the group of opiods/opiates, you are right to question the clinical value of them.</p>
<p>Oxycodon may have a better metabolism (morphine has active metabolites and is more reliant on kidney function) and a more predictable bioavailability. </p>
<p>In some surgical protocols you want a very short half-life (you might have continuous administration) which makes remifentanils pharmacological properties beneficial.</p>
<p>There are some opiods that have secondary effects, suchs as tramadol and tapentadol (monoaminergic reuptake inhibition).</p>
<p>There might also be a difference in documentation, for instance a pharmaceutical company might have been more willing to perform a study on a &quot;new condition&quot; using drugs that they still own - and we are more willing to use drugs with good studies backing them up. </p>
<p>A very down to earth reason is that daily dosages of morphine in the 400 mg range <del>i.v.</del>parenterally (with extra doses around 70 mg) evokes more worry than 80 mg of hydromorphone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of these answers are somewhat incomplete. There are many reasons for there to be different opioid medications, including differential receptor activity, differential patient effect, differential route suitability, and intent. There are many reasons to have a variety of pain medications, particularly because these pain medications constitute different classes within what could be termed the opioid family. The classes would be phenanthrenes, phenylheptylamines, and phenylpiperidines. </p>
<p>These are basically ways to describe the structures of the pain medication, and these structures are important- it means differential effects on opioid receptors and different effects on different people. If a person is allergic to morphine, they might not have an allergy to oxycodone, fentanyl, or dilaudid. If a person has intractable vomiting with oxycodone, changing them to hydrocodone or oral dilaudid might alleviate the symptoms. You mention medications like buprenorphine- this is a partial agonist at opioid receptors, and thus acts to prevent opioid abuse by reducing the activity of illicit substances at these receptors- by partially activating it prevents full activation. </p>
<p>Opioids have many side effects due to their receptor activity, most famous among them is probably constipation. Consider that one drive to create new opioid medications is to attempt to eliminate the constipating effect of opioids, given the morbidity associated. The receptor activity can also include non-opioid receptors, like the NMDA receptor. Ketamine is probably the best known NMDA receptor antagonist, but methadone has both opioid agonist effects and NMDA receptor antagonist effects. Both ketamine and methadone can be very useful in management of chronic pain (ketamine generally restricted to inpatient use), particularly after major surgical procedures. </p>
<p>The ability to use a medication via various routes is also a rationale to develop new medications. Transitioning from one medication to another (IV to oral medication, for example) can be problematic given the differential effect that individual medications can have on an individual patient- consider that oxycodone is not available in IV formulation in the US, so there is a level of guesswork involved. Additionally, I see some comments are listing oral vs. IV tmax (time to maximum concentration) as leading to different medications- this is primarily related to the route, not the medication. </p>
<p>With regard to intent, opioids used for surgical anesthesia can be very different from those used for postoperative pain management or outpatient pain management. Remifentanil is an extremely useful medication allowing for saturation of opioid receptors at one moment and near absence of the drug 20 minutes later. This is EXTREMELY useful, especially as the half life stays constant regardless of how long the medication is infusing- with other narcotics, the context sensitive half time grows longer and longer- for example a 1 hr case with a fentanyl infusion might take 25 minutes for a half life, a 2 hr case might take 2 hrs. Remifentanil is always around 4 minutes, 1 hr case or 10 hr. For cases where extubation is predicted but blood pressure must be tightly controlled/the surgery is extremely stimulating, this is very useful. </p>
<p>I also notice in the comments many people are bringing this back to opioid overprescription- understand that in the 90s and early 2000s many people thought that we have the opposite issue- in 2002 JCAHO (the joint commission) released information on how to improve pain control and mandated that hospitals have comprehensive pain treatment strategies (they now emphasize NON-pharmacologic). Now, Medicare and Medicaid utilize a survey (HCAHPS) that uses, in part, how well a patient's pain was treated to dictate what physicians and hospitals are reimbursed. It's very popular to blame physicians as a whole for overprescription of pain medications, and in many cases very reasonable, but additional attention must be paid to the societal factors influencing prescription trends. Opioids are useful short term agents, and certainly reasonable in the case of chronic cancer related pain, but that is typically where their utility ends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said: the various opioid analgesics actually have quite different pharmacokinetics, metabolism, side effects, etc. and are available in different preparations and combinations with other drugs. Of course, some drug choice is based on habit and physician comfort level, in particular outpatient pain management by PCPs is more art and less science, but most choices are based on each drug's unique properties. If morphine was perfect in all situations, why would Pharma have spent the money to synthesize new opioids?</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>-The dosing of morphine is easy, as 10 mg IV is the dose which all other opioid doses are compared to, so many providers default to this in acute situations.</p>
<p>-Morphine can cause vasodilation (and subsequent hypotension) which can be quite a problem in hemodynamically unstable patients, making fentanyl and other similar drugs a much safer choice.</p>
<p>-Morphine relies on renal clearance to a high degree. Other commonly used mid-range PO meds like oxycodone, Percocet, Norco, and Dilaudid are hepatically cleared. This makes them more user-friendly in the inpatient setting where everyone seems to have something wrong with their kidneys: diabetic nephropathy, contrast-induced nephropathy (from getting CT scans with IV contrast), prerenal AKI (kidney injury due to a period of reduced perfusion- usually from hypotension), etc. This is a big reason why these drugs are the inpatient default. However in patients with liver disease the opposite is true.</p>
<p>-Fentanyl and similar drugs such as sufentanil and remifentanil are much more lipid soluble than morphine which make the onset of action quicker due to ease of crossing cell membranes. They also have very short half lives. This makes them ideal for procedural sedation. The patient goes to sleep right away, the medication is dosed periodically to maintain the desired depth of sedation, and they wake up quickly when the procedure is over. Anesthesia is a very calculation based practice and every drug choice is deliberate.</p>
<p>-Fentanyl is not available as a PO formulation. The half life is too short for it to make any sense as a home PO pain med because nobody wants to take a pill every half hour. However it does come in LONG acting transdermal patch form, which is unique, and nasal sprays which are nice for kids as another poster noted.</p>
<p>-Oxycodone has a higher bioavailability (60-85%) than morphine (20-40% per wikipedia) when taken PO due to morphine's first pass metabolism, so it almost feels wasteful to prescribe PO morphine.</p>
<p>-Some PO opioids like Percocet, Norco, and Vicodin also contain acetaminophen for additional pain control via a different mechanism. However, this limits the max dose due to the hepatic toxicity of acetaminophen at fairly low doses.</p>
<p>-OxyContin and MS-Contin are formulated to be long-acting so they can be dosed q12h rather than q4-6h which makes them ideal for home treatment of chronic, predictable pain but not good for first-time treatment of acute pain.</p>
<p>-With regard to meds used in PCA pumps, dilaudid is more water soluble than morphine and therefore can be delivered in a smaller volume of water, which becomes important in fluid overloaded patients.</p>
<p>-Methadone is only used for pain in opioid tolerant patients. I'm not entirely sure why, but it does have a very long duration of action which is not what you want in an acute pain control setting but makes it ideal for daily dosing to prevent withdrawal in recovering addicts.</p>
<p>-Speaking of addiction recovery, buprenophine aka Suboxone is everyone's new favorite drug. It is a combination agonist-antagonist. The receptors are only partially stimulated by it's binding, so the user doesn't get much of a high but it still prevents withdrawal. However, the medication has a high affinity for the receptor, so it will block the binding of other opiates should the user relapse.</p>
<p>-Demerol used to be very frequently used, but has fallen out of favor due to its production of a neurotoxic metabolite and its potential to contribute to serotonin syndrome (Libby Zion anyone?)</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just scratching the surface of the pharmacology, but hopefully gives you an idea of the thought process that goes on in a hospital. Hope this answers your question!</p>
<p>edit: Sorry for the wall of text!</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Different drugs are mostly used for different reasons. Big Pharma has less influence than you think, and most docs prescribe generics when available.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use a variety of opioids in treating post-op patients. Fentanyl is great at taking the white knuckles edge off for a minute so I can get other drugs on board to carry the patient through until they have a block, epidural, Pca or at least oral meds in to serve as a longer acting solution.
Some drugs I avoid specifically depending on the case. dilaudid causes urinary retention- so I never go there for open ab or gyn cases, since monitoring urinary output is key in their recovery.
Fentanyl is a great resp suppressant, so I don't touch it if I have a resp compromised case. But in a case where fluid status is closely monitored? Fentanyl delivers in much smaller volume than other narcs.
For peds good old oralTylenol and morphine IV are the standard. Some will prescribe fentanyl IV, some loratab elixir, depending on the kiddo.
Really, they could all be replaced by morphine in a pinch, but when considering pt status, and other drugs being used, it is helpful to be able to select one drug over another to obtain pain management while avoiding some side effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
