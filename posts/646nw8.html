		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The missiles are not that big and not designed to work efficiently on concrete and earthworks. The people on the base were warned before the attack and had either evacuated from the base or hidden in bunkers. And a runway is very difficult to completely destroy. A single missile can only make a small crater. And the craters can be quickly be filled in and patched. So you need to bomb the entire runway with hundreds or thousands of bombs to move enough dirt to make it unusable. And it is still easy to build a new runway with some earth movers and pavement layers so the damage can be fixed in a week. So targeting a runway is a pretty dumb idea. It is better to target the fuel supply and hangars, but on a military base these are built out of solid concrete and can survive a lot of damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please reference the &quot;third war head&quot; in this video for an example of the types of missiles that were likely used in this attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/8sa7ZX58Kk4" target="_blank">Cruise Missile Warhead Types</a> </p>
<p>The sub munitions likely used hit planes and hardware around the airfield with small bits of shrapnel and debris and also make divots on a runway as well. Although the destruction is not dramatic or fantastic on cameras, the results are more than satisfactory at an airfield where airplanes, fuel dumps, trucks, supplies etc. are strewn about in a wide area. Airplanes are rather delicate fragile birds of prey and even a few bits of shrapnel can render them inoperable. They also don't handle a divot in the ground on take off at 120 mph very well and so the runway will likely need re smoothing over the next few weeks. </p>
<p>Without getting to far into the politics I believe this was a harassing attack on one airfield that reestablished a redline to not use chemical weapons. There are many other airfields the Syrian government has control of (although likely with Russian personnel and equipment stationed at them) and so this will not even come close to grounding their Air Force. Even this base and those planes may be operational again in another month or so depending how well the Syrians can repair their planes and runways in their current state of war. </p>

<p>The runway wasn't destroyed because small warheads were used, and many were used on other targets (equipment, buildings).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the main target would be the buildings, equipment and planes, rather than simply the runway itself which is easily replaced. As for the people killed Russia was given advanced warning of the strike, to make sure no Russian personnel were killed and they would have told the Syrians who would have evacuated anyone important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
