		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Conservation of angular momentum. Our solar system started out as a rotating gas cloud. Over time, this cloud collapsed and denser regions formed the sun and the planets. But due to conservation of angular momentum, the rotation had to remain, which means that the solar system as a whole rotates around the same axis that the original gas cloud did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current nebular theory of solar system formation explains this feature of our solar system as the result of formation from the collapse of a large cloud of gas and dust (nebula).  As the nebula collapses under its own gravity, any tiny initial rotation in the cloud is amplified as it shrinks in size, just like a figure skater pulling in their arms to increase their rate of spin (conservation of angular momentum).  The nebula forms a disk as it collapses, because of the combination of gravity and centrifugal force: gravity points <em>towards</em> the <strong>center</strong> of the cloud, and centrifugal force points <em>away</em> from the <strong>axis of rotation</strong> of the cloud.  This means that on the &quot;equator&quot; of the cloud, these two forces point in opposite directions and partially cancel each other, but on the &quot;poles&quot; of the cloud, they are at right angles to each other, and there's nothing stopping gravity from flattening the cloud into a disk.  The sun forms in the middle of this disk, and the planets form around it, in the rotating disk, and so they all end up going in the same direction and in (nearly) the same plane. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, when a solar system or a galaxy is forming, the cloud of mass has a collective plane of rotation as a system, and that rotational momentum must be conserved. However, all the up and down motion of the particles in the Z axis eventually cancels each other out as particles collide and bound together from gravity. What ends up happening is the cloud loses all the motion in the Z axis and maintain the rotational momentum. </p>

<p>the general ideal is that if objects are rotating in opposite directions and they collide then they both lose energy and &quot;fall&quot; inward. given enough collisions what remains will be orbiting roughly the same direction</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they didn't, they'd occasionally hit each other.  Hitting each other tends to average out the orbital plane of the remaining debris.  When you look at &quot;Planets&quot;, you are seeing the congealed clusters of debris from many, many collisions, averaged out until their remaining orbital elements are very, very similar.</p>
<p>The plane we ended up with by simple chance is the prevailing rotational element about the center of mass that was present in the previous ball of swirling gas that came before Sol.  If that gas was arranged slightly differently, we'd have a different orbital plane.</p>
<p>The reason we have &quot;planets&quot; instead of &quot;Rings&quot; (other than the asteroid belt) is that the Solar Wind blew away much of the extra gas, and anything that's not arranged in a plane with some spacing between circular orbits, has occasional gravitational interactions that cause their orbit to be unstable and collide with something eventually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
