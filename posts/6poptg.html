		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually don't always have to measure anything to do with your mouse movement or click.  They can look for a cookie, or a collection of cookies that various Google services like Gmail place on your device, maybe even cookies from other companies.  Also, your browser gives a lot of information to websites about its capabilities in the user agent string.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent</a>  Obviously, the details of what exactly Google is looking for are secret or bots could just spoof them.</p>
<p>Some people think that Google can actually identify individual people with their No CAPTCHA tech.  They think Google can potentially read so much information from your browser that they can track you even if you delete cookies or take other common steps to avoid that kind of tracking:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just mouse movement, the captchas know you've used the same browser on other Google services (proving you're an active user, thus not a robot). If they're not sure, they'll ask you to do a regular captcha. Google will remember you completed the captcha, and probably won't ask you the next time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the top comments in here are correct. As well as JavaScript being able to access gyroscope data from your phone. Especially useful if you're holding your phone in your hands (which is highly likely) as the gyro data will change all the time which the captcha tool could also use. We'll never know the exact algorithm they use, cause if we did, then it wouldn't work! </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
