This publication had some delay after the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm604357.htm" target="_blank">FDA approved the AI-system, called IDx-DR, on April 11 of this year</a>.</p>
<p>After the approval, many physicians, scientists, and patients had questions about the safety of the AI system, its design, the design of the clinical trial, the trial results, as well as what the results mean for people with diabetes, for the healthcare system, and the future of AI in healthcare. Now, we are finally able to discuss these questions, and I thought a reddit AMA is the most appropriate place to do so. While this is a true AMA, I want to focus on the paper and the study. Questions about cost, pricing, market strategy, investing, and the like I consider to not be about the science, and are also under the highest regulatory scrutiny, so those will have to wait until a later AMA.</p>
<p>I am a retinal specialist - a physician who specialized in ophthalmology and then did a fellowship in vitreoretinal surgery - who treats patients with retinal diseases and teaches medical students, residents, and fellows. I am also a machine learning and image analysis expert, with a MS in Computer Science focused on Artificial Intelligence, and  a PhD in image analysis - Jan Koenderink was one of my advisors. 1989-1990 I was  postdoc in Tokyo, Japan, at the RIKEN neural networks research lab. I was one of the original contributors of ImageJ, a widely used open source image analysis app. I have published over 250 peer reviewed  journal papers (h-index 53) on AI, image analysis, and retina, am past Editor of the journals IEEE TMI and IOVS, and editor of Nature Scientific Reports, and have 17 patents and 5 patent applications in this area. I am the Watzke Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Iowa, and I am proud to say that my former graduate students are successful in AI all over the world. <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/eye/abramoff" target="_blank">More info on me on my faculty page</a>.</p>
<p>I also am Founder and President of <a href="https://www.eyediagnosis.net/" target="_blank">IDx</a>, the company that sponsored the study we will be discussing and that markets the AI system, and thus have a conflict of interest. FDA and other regulatory agencies - depending on where you are located - regulate what I can and cannot say about the AI system performance, and I will indicate when that is the case. <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea14f7_410f793af1504f46a9bf76d20a3b4d02.pdf" target="_blank">More info on the AI system, called labelling, here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be in and out for a good part of the day, AMA!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering the need for human interaction (caregiver - patient) in medicine, what are your thoughts going forward?  Restrict these AI to assist medical professionals in the diagnostic process (read: allow them more patient contact time - a major hurdle most medical tech development is focused on currently) or replace much of the function of a human in healthcare?</p>
<p>If the latter, do you think that’s a viable goal, again considering the imperative for human contact in the healthcare sector?  Medicine is still in dire need of functional technology assistance (particularly in diagnoses), but how far do you feel we can take it before there is significant diminishing returns/potential backlash? Say, 20 years down the road, the requirements for an M.D are reduced to fill the existing void, because some major part of their training has now been replaced by AI.  So we get more medical professional, but they’re less trained, potentially less capable/more reliant on AI.</p>
<p>Also congratulations to you and your team, this FDA approval is no small matter!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any thoughts on how to make these diagnostic systems available to places that could really use them (e.g. low income countries which lack qualified diagnosticians)?  This is a problem we see in neuroimaging, where there are some very capable AI based image analysis tools, however, often the only places which can afford them are places which already have excellent clinicians.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
