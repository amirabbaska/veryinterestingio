		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was already known by the 1800s that aurorae produced disturbances in Earth's magnetic field (which was observed by looking at the direction of a magnetic needle, similar to a compass), so it was assumed that aurorae were somehow associated with geomagnetic activity. Some of the first inkling that aurorae were connected with <em>solar</em> magnetic activity, though, came 100 years before validation of Parker's theories.</p>
<p>In an 1861 letter to the Royal Society, &quot;<em>On  the  Great  Magnetic  Disturbance  of  August  28  to  September  7,  1859,  as  recorded  by  Photography  at  the Kew  Observatory</em>&quot; (PDF <a href="http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/407.full.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), Balfour Stewart noticed that the once-in-a-lifetime aurorae of 1859 were immediately preceded by the largest white-light flare ever observed on the Sun, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859" target="_blank">Carrington Event</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the latter part of August, and the beginning of September, 1859,  auroral displays of almost  unprecedented magnificence were observed very widely throughout our globe,  accompanied  (as is invariably the case) with excessive disturbances of the magnetic needle.</p>
<p>The interest attached to these appearances is, if possible, enhanced by the fact, that at the time of their occurrence a large spot might have been seen on the disc of our luminary, a celestial phenomenon which we have  grounds for supposing to be intimately connected
with auroral exhibitions and magnetic storms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was really the first solid evidence of a connection made between the aurorae and solar activity. Stewart also notes that his magnetic needles actually started fluctuating with the simultaneous observation of the solar flare, not just the incidence of the aurorae:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This disturbance  affected  the  magnetograph simultaneously  with  the breaking out, near a spot on the sun’s disc, of a bright star, which was fortunately observed both by Mr. Carrington and Mr. Hodgson, independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to posit a direct connection between &quot;our luminary&quot; (the Sun) and Earth's magnetic field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now suppose a primary current, probably in our luminary, to in­fluence the  earth,  and suppose its general direction to remain the same  for  at  least  seven  hours.  This  current  would  act  on  the magnetic matter of the earth in the same manner during these seven hours; and would, therefore, account for the magnetic wave of seven hours’ duration.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The observation of auroras has given rise to a very broad spectrum of mythological, superstitious and scientific explanations over all times of recorded history. In this answer I focus on the purely scientific ideas before 1800 A.D., which I have taken from the book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Poxcz5AbrpcC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=auroras+ether&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g7T46pnRWr&amp;sig=VT1bwASHbZf5Zb2t-xXjJO95woI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW2rfZhPPcAhXhhOAKHXRNBMoQ6AEwEnoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=auroras%20ether&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Aurora: The Northern Lights in Mythology, History and Science</a> that I happen to have a copy.</p>
<p>Hippocrates (fifth century B.C.) theorized that auroras are caused by reflected sunlight, an erroneous explanation of the aurora which was to surface many more times over the ensuing 2500 years. Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) in his classical treatise &quot;<em>Meteorologica</em>&quot; provides a more dispassionate scientific description of auroras (he refers to it as chasmata):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes on a clear night a number of appearances can be seen taking shape in the sky, such as chasms,  trenches and blood-red colors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aristotle probably witnessed the extensive displays of 349 and 344 B.C., though he may have seen other events during his years in Macedonia (343-336 B.C.), the latitude of which is more favorable for auroral occurrence than that of Greece. He believed that matter was formed by four elements (fire, air, water, and earth). He theorized that heat from the sun caused a vapor to rise from the earth's surface and collide with the element fire which then burst into flames producing the aurora. He then argued that reflection and attenuation of the fiery light as it passes through the denser, lower air contribute to the production of the observed colors, and he implied that the large angular extent and speed of the phenomenon confirmed its sublunary origin.</p>
<p>Other descriptions of auroras in the Middle Ages tended towards superstition and military significance. For example, auroras seen in Italy around 567 A D. were interpreted by the Benedictine Gregorius Magnus as omens announcing the invasion of the Lombards in 568 A.D. Although several records of auroras were made, they were usually considered as a curious manifestation of the supernatural. More commonly, astrology and events in the heavens so troubled the minds of men that the aurora borealis often became a source of terror.  The end of the first millenium A.D. saw the first authentic auroral observers, with many records around the Middle East (1097\~110 A.D), Prague (1128\~1139 A.D.), and England from 1170 to the end of the twelfth century. However, one of these auroras, which appeared soon after the death of Thomas Becket in 1170, was seen by many as the blood of the martyr going up to heaven.</p>
<p>The last three centuries of the Middle Ages yielded little in the way of auroral reports. Besides being a period of less than average solar activity (and so few auroras would have appeared over Europe at any rate), it was an age when enquiry and reason were stifled by religious dogma.</p>
<p>William Fulke, a puritan Doctor of Divinity at Cambridge, published a book in 1563 trying to explain scientifically and without superstition almost all natural phenomena. With regard to auroras, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a certain quantity of vapors are gathered together on a heap, being very more compact, as it were bardtepered together, this being of vapors ascending to a region of cold, is forcibly beaten back, which violence of moving, is sufficient to kindle it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for the record, the book was entitled &quot;<em>A Goodly Gallerye With a Most Pleasant Prospect, into the Garden of Natural Contemplation, to Behold the Naturall Causes of All Kynde of Meteors, as Wel Fyery and A yery as Watry and Earthly&quot;</em></p>
<p>Although sixteenth century Europe had seen the beginning of the great Renaissance of arts and sciences and also witnessed a marked increase in the frequency of auroras in European skies, this fortuitous combination of events did not immediately produce any scientific speculation as to the nature of the aurora. Fear and superstition continued into the early seventeenth century even among physicists. Mercure Francois wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In March and September some meteors and signs always appear in the sky and every physicist agrees that they bring neither good nor bad</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On November 17, 1607, Johannes Kepler minutely described a great aurora seen over Europe, and Galileo Galilei witnessed an outstanding display in Venice in 1621. Galileo proposed an auroral theory reminiscent of Aristotle's, and coined the term &quot;aurora borealis&quot; after Aurora, the Roman goddess of morning (Eos in the Greek mythology). Gassendi, the French mathematician and astronomer, also described the aurora of 1621 reasoning that the vapor of the aurora must be at a great altitude, as the convexity of the earth was no hindrance to it being visible in the same situation from places remotely distant from one another.</p>
<p>René Descartes may also have seen the aurora around this time or at least had the phenomenon described to him. He seems to have been the originator of the idea that the aurora resulted from the scattering of sunlight from ice particles. These particles would be characteristic of the cold high-latitude regions where aurora were more common, and as they were high in the atmosphere, they could reflect sunlight even after the sun had passed below the horizon.</p>
<p>Edmund Halley lived during the period of the Maunder minimum. Although he was more famous for his comet studies, he was also fascinated by the historical accounts of the aurora. At first he suggested that watery vapors, which are rarefied and sublimed by subterraneous fire, might carry along with them sulphureous vapors sufficient to produce this luminous appearance in the atmosphere. He then pictured a circulating pattern of magnetical effluvia along the lines of magnetic forces on the earth and illustrated it with a diagram of a magnetized sphere. Halley discussed the corona shape of the aurora, where rays of light appear like the spokes of a wheel converging towards a central point near the zenith.</p>
<p>The first serious disagreement with Halley's views was published by Mr. W. Derham in 1728. After a detailed, description of auroras he had observed, he advanced his conviction that they were of the same matter or vapors that produced earthquakes. As evidence of the association, he quoted an auroral report of November 14, 1574, which was followed by a great earthquake on February 26 1575, and noted that the aurora he observed on October 8, 1728, was preceded by a fatal earthquake in Sicily and succeeded by one in England on October 25.  In France, Maraidi expressed the opinion that the aurora was caused by &quot;subtle, suiphurous exhalations,&quot; which contributed to calming the air, as auroras seemed to occur when the air was calm and temperate.</p>
<p>Mairan, around 1733, ridiculed the currently popular idea that the aurora was a reflection of sunlight from polar ice and snow and also criticized Halley's theory. He believed that aurora are an extension of the sun's atmosphere. He suggested that the earth traversed the outer portions of this atmosphere at certain points in its revolutions about the sun and that mingling with the earth's atmosphere produced the various phenomena of the aurora.</p>
<p>Soon after the invention of the discharge tube in 1753, it was speculated that the aurora was a discharge phenomenon in the upper atmosphere. An almost universal conviction developed among scientists that the newly discovered electricity was the true cause of aurora, and for a long time there was little further speculation on the subject. Experiments with discharge tubes became a central part of auroral research for the next hundred years.</p>
