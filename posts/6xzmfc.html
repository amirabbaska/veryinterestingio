That is fine and well as long as there is a power source connected, but how can for example the memory stick retain its information when it is unplugged from the computer?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on the medium of storage and how information is stored on it. Media like CDs and hard drives can store information without power, while RAM can't.</p>
<p>RAM uses circuitry to store the 0s and 1s. A 0 means there is no current passing through the circuit, and a 1 means there is. Since the circuit requires electricity to function, all information is lost without it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 0s and 1s on a CD are stored as physical crests and troughs on the medium. On a hard drive, they are stored as magnetic polarities (North or South) on a magnetic medium. In both cases, once the 0s and 1s have been created, they don't need electricity to persist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, you have optical storage, like CD, DVD, or Blu-Ray where <del>tiny holes let a laser beam trough and mean 1 or no hole means 0.</del> a sequence of microscopic indentations reflect a laser beam with different intensity than the flat surface and is interpreted as binary data.  </p>
<p>Then there is magnetic storage, like hard disks or tapes, where a special material is locally magnetized one way or the other, meaning 1 or 0, and remains that way without power.  </p>
<p>And then there is your USB stick or SSD, which contains a special memory type, NAND flash, which has some special transistors (Floating-gate transistor) that do not lose their electric field on one of the gates when disconnected from power. And other types of flash memory too.</p>
<p>LE: replaced the <em>tiny holes</em> theory with the <em>indentation clarification</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solid state devices, like the one in a USB memory and some newer hard drives hold a charge (each memory cell is an electron trap), kind of like a mini battery.</p>
<p>You could make a storage device out of a set of rechargeable batteries if you wanted, charge up a battery and it represents a 1 or shortcut it until it'd empty and you have a 0, just connect a volt meter to each battery to see if it's charged or not to read your memory. This doesn't require any power to store the memory, but it requires energy to read and write.</p>
<p>Older mechanical hard drives rely on magnetism, that doesn't require steady current either. You can magnetize an iron nail with a magnet and it will remain magnetic afterwards, without any current. Same with these! only smaller nails. This is how analog information was stored before the computer days as well, remember video tapes?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For brevity, I will assume you already know enough about transistors and don't need more information on them. I will also assume you know about diodes, which is hard to avoid on the path to learning about transistors as a simple transistor is basically a diode and a half.</p>
<p>Now, transistors and diodes are commonly packaged into functional units known as <em>logic gates.</em> You could imagine these as boxes with one or more inputs and an output, with the output depending on the inputs and the type of gate. There's the NOT gate, which basically inverts the signal, zeroing the output when the input is a one and vice versa. There's the AND gate, which does exactly what it says on the tin: if all the inputs are all ones, the output is a one, and otherwise it's a zero.</p>
<p>The one we're interested in is the NAND gate, which is a NOT gate tacked onto the output of an AND gate. This means that the output will be zero when the the inputs are all ones, and otherwise it's a one. Thus, assuming the names A and B for the inputs and X for the output:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>X</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, imagine two of these bad boys next to each other. Actually, scratch that. <em>Draw it,</em> otherwise you'll just be confused. Let's append numbers to the connector names, so we can tell them apart. Now, connect X₁ – that is to say, the output of gate one – to A₂ – the first input of gate two – and X₂ to A₁. Now, imagine that you have connected power to B₁ and B₂, so they are constantly ones, but can be made powerless when you so desire.</p>
<p>When you first power this thing on, one of the outputs will be one, and the other zero. Now, do a thought experiment, and try to figure out for yourself what happens if you briefly make each of the B inputs powerless. The answer follows in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>If you make the B input powerless on the gate where the output is zero, that output will go high, and the other output will go low. Connecting power to that B input again will not change the outputs, but doing the same thing with the <em>other</em> B input will restore the original state. And that is how you store information in a powered system. This is known as a <em>NAND latch.</em> There are other types of latches, but this one is one of the more common ones, and it demonstrates the principle. Flash chips are basically vast arrays of latches. This leads to an unholy amount of input and output leads – although not as many as you think, as usually something called <em>multiplexing</em> is used, but that's beyond the scope of this ELI5 – so usually a flash memory chip is coupled with a flash <em>controller</em> chip, which is basically a translator between whatever language the computer wants to speak (USB, SATA, &amp;c.) and these input and output pins. I say <em>usually,</em> because some older memory card formats – such as the xD-Picture card and the SmartMedia card – didn't contain a controller, but had the NAND flash chip connected more or less directly to the card pins. This made them cheap to produce, and the host system had more control over the raw memory structure which meant they could in theory optimise the use of it. The damning disadvantage, though, was that, as a bigger array of latches means more input and output leads, the controller-less design pretty soon hit an upper size limit, as greater sizes would have meant redesigning the card, which would have made it incompatible with existing devices. And that probably <em>was</em> beyond the scope of an ELI5, but there you are.</p>
<p>It should be added that these gates aren't actually <em>powered</em> by the inputs and the outputs. Those are data ports, not power ports. Power is supplied individually on other pins. So, what is providing the power when the device isn't connected to another, powered, device? In short: Capacitors. Well, not really. Modern NAND flash uses something called floating-gate MOSFETs, which is a fancy name for a type of transistor where one of the nodes are <em>floating,</em> i. e. not directly connected to anything, and thus is only capacitively influenced. A transistor with a built-in capacitor in a funny way, basically. So, again, in short: capacitors. These capacitors are pretty resilient and will hold the charge for long, long periods of time, but flash memory is definitely not something you would chuck in a vault and expect to be able to read in a century's time. The longevity of USB flash drives is measured in decades – and, if you ask me, talking about <em>decades</em> in plural is pushing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
