		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also a blood banker.  Separated into it's components, some parts last 5 days, some last 42 days, some can be frozen for a year, some can be frozen for ten years and manufactured into other products.  We're always looking at ways to extend shelf life.  We're pretty crazy about inventory efficiency too, but expired product (usually only group AB red blood cells, or excess platelets which only last 5 days and are harder to manage) are biomedical waste or research material.  Biomedical waste goes for incineration.  (Edit:  So, Group AB, please donate plasma and platelets if you can.  Group O people, stick with the whole blood.  That way, we can maximize the usefulness of your gift!)</p>
<p>Edit, again: For all those who are asking &quot;I'm type (letter/Rh), what should I do?&quot; the answer to the question is always changing.  Inventory fluctuates and we can get short on any group at any time, so ask your local blood bank, or answer the phone when they call. :)  </p>
<p>In my geographic area, we might collect about 300 units of blood in a day.  Let's say 7 percent are O negative type, as is the case in North America.  That's 21 units.  A single major trauma or bleeding event can use 40 units of blood.  (That's the extreme, though)  Just some perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The excess beyond that that goes unused is medical waste. Please donate off and on every other year. If just ten more of the people that could donate did this, there would be absolutely no blood shortages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's disposed of. According to one report it gets incinerated. The report states that only about 4% of donated blood (in Scotland in 2015) is destroyed due to expiring, although some more was lost because of mistakes and faults in handling it.</p>
<p>If there is a surplus of a certain blood type, blood donation centres simply won't call in those donors as often to reduce the amount of blood that must be disposed of. This has been the case for AB+ women, because AB+ blood can only be transfused into other AB+ persons but AB+ recipients can take any of the common blood types. Plasma from AB women who have ever been pregnant can cause problems for the recipient too.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it gets disposed of as medical waste. This is why you should not donate blood right after a natural disaster. There is too much blood being given at 1 time and we cannot use it all before it expires.</p>
<p>You should donate blood regularly throughout the year instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
