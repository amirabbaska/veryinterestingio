It's about the <em>history</em> of knowledge of the interior composition.  Since, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duuorz9/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=askscience" target="_blank">recent spacecraft results</a> suggest it may gradually transition into something like a small solid core, let's interpret the question as, &quot;When did we first realize that Jupiter wasn't a rocky planet&quot;?</p>
<p>To solve this problem, you need to calculate the mass of Jupiter and its size, so you can find its <em>density</em>.  The mass of Jupiter can be calculated using Newtonian orbital mechanics, provided you know the orbital period and orbital diameter of its moons.  Period is easy, but a major historical problem in solar system studies was finding the relative scale of <em>everything</em>: it's easy to measure angles and relative sizes with a telescope, but we need the actual length dimensions.  You need a baseline distance to start with, such as the distance from the Earth to the Sun: this was worked out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#History" target="_blank">in the late 1600s</a>: from that, the size of Jupiter, the size of its moons' orbits, and thus its mass and density could be found.</p>
<p>So even before 1700, astronomers realized that Jupiter was 300 times the mass of Earth, but with a density much less than that of rock.  Since the density known today is about 1.4 times that of water, I suppose that without knowledge of high-pressure physics they couldn't rule out a liquid water or ice planet, but scientists have known for over 300 years that Jupiter is definitely not a rocky world.  H. G. Wells was a fantastic writer, but he maybe wasn't so meticulous about doing his library research.</p>
<p>The story is laid out by Reta Beebe in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JUPITER-Smithsonian-Library-Solar-System/dp/1560986859" target="_blank"><em>Jupiter: The Giant Planet</em></a> (1997).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some time in the 70's when the data was analyzed and the math was worked out that showed that it was not dense enough to contain a substantial (~more than 50% mass) amount of dense rock. It would sink in water, but just barely. (Saturn would float)</p>
<p>The only explanation that accounts for the low density is that Jupiter is mostly gas. Then basic physics tells us how those gasses behave under pressure - they get denser and somewhat thicker until they become a hot liquid. </p>
<p>So in all likelihood we have two scenarios for a Jovian &quot;surface&quot;</p>
<p>1) there isn't one - it just gets thicker as you go deeper. </p>
<p>2) it somewhat quickly becomes a liquid that is somewhat indistinguishable from the gas above it - drizzle to rain to slush to that tasty, tasty Jovian juice.</p>
<p>Eventually you wind up at a core of some sort - but who knows what that's like?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Pioneer and Voyager missions helped with this somewhat, though indirectly. The affect of the planet's gravity on the <em>known</em> speed, direction, and mass of the space probe allowed us to calculate fairly precisely the amount of mass Jupiter would have to have in order to produce the seen affects.</p>
<p>We've known the distance to Jupiter and approximate size of the visible part of the planet, so once we knew the mass it was fairly simple to work out the density. Knowing the density allowed us to then say &quot;it is either all heavy gasses, or there are a lot of light gasses and something--perhaps Earth sized--at the center that is a solid core&quot;. Considering that a few hundred Earths could fit inside Jupiter, the idea that the core might be Earth sized is impressive to us but in reality is some single-digit percent of the overall mass and volume of the planet. It would compare favorably to putting a peanut in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda and asking someone to find it blindfolded, using only one hand, while crawling on hands and knees. An Earth-size core is very (very) vanishingly small under the incredible amount of matter Jupiter has on hand.</p>
<p>The other fun thing with Jupiter that helps us determine its makeup is the fact that it is esssentially invisible to radar. This means it is comparable to clouds and air on Earth. We can see Venus on radar, we can see Mars, we can see the four big Moons of Jupiter on radar. But we can't see Jupiter itself except for the occasional wisp; on radar the moons of Jupiter appear to circle empty space. This implies that if there is anything solid there it is so buried as to be effectively non-existent for human purposes.</p>
<p>[This is different from <em>radio</em> astronomy, which uses radio dishes to study radio emissions from planets and stars; in radio frequencies Jupiter is VERY loud].</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to add is <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Differential+Rotation" target="_blank">differential rotation</a>, which basically means that different parts/regions of a celestial body rotate at different speeds. So a solid planet would rotate in alignment across all latitudes while gas objects (sun, Jupiter) typically have equatorial regions that rotate more quickly than areas closer to the poles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples of differential rotation are found throughout astronomy. In stars (including the Sun) and the gas giant planets, the equatorial regions rotate faster than regions closer to the poles, meaning that equatorial sunspots and cloud formations will move across the face of the object faster than their polar cousins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1690, Giovanni Cassini was the first to discover the differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere. What I don't know though is whether that was exactly translated to: 'Jupiter must be a gaseous or gaseous-like body.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
