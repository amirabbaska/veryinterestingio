		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rub your thumb on your pointing and middle fingers. Barely makes a noise to us, but in ultrasonic ranges it's noisy (pops and cracks believe it or not). That's one of the reasons it's so easy to attract cats to you with that motion. They hear it even though we don't. Edit: Changed index to middle (finger). Thanks all.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Well, I had hoped to find my old detector and make a video for you all, but it isn't working very well these days. Worse, the website I bought it from is no longer offering it, so you'll have to settle for a line on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051218192908/http://www.xtronics.com/kits/SK-207.htm" target="_blank">wayback archive of it</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;Rubbing your fingers generates ultrasonic noise up to about 60 kHz.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm also starting to wonder if the pops and cracks I heard where faults in the unit. It's doing a lot of that now. I have to try resoldering it and see if that fixes it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes we definitely do. Do we use these frequencies to communicate, like bats? No.</p>
<p>Whenever a sound is made, you can map the intensity of the sound at certain frequencies with a frequency response plot. If you've ever thought seriously about buying studio monitors for recording and mixing I'm sure you've seen one of these, as these plots become important when you are trying to reproduce sounds with high fidelity. Sound frequencies are emitted in a continuum, just like light frequencies. There is no cutoff on this continuum where the frequency response becomes zero just because we can no longer hear that frequency. Therefore, all you need is a source in the body that can produce a sound with low/high enough frequency. It is not dependent on our ability to hear it or not.</p>
<p>As far as frequencies that are too high to hear, I can't think of any off the top of my head. However, I'm sure some of our bodily processes that essentially use our whole body as an acoustic resonator, for example a hunger pang, produce frequencies that are too low for us to hear (as well as some that we can hear). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All sounds are just vibrations at different frequencies. Hypothetically, if you could wave your arm in the air back and forth 100 times a second, forgetting about loudness for a moment, it would vibrate the air enough to produce a tone. But what you can actually do, maybe 4 or 5 times a second, even if we could perceive frequencies that low would be too quiet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lucky for you guys i happen to have some supersonic recording equipment on hand, capable of recording well up to 96khz (human hearing goes up to about 22khz tops. I use these for analysis and sound design)</p>
<p>everything at the top of the spectrum I've highlighted is in the range we can't hear, you can clearly see some sound is being generated up there. </p>

<p>So by handwaving, we can see that clearly humans produce noises outside the range of frequencies we can hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
