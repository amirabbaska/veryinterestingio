		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An interesting question! </p>
<p>I would say yes, but with some very significant qualifications. Some quick background observations. I live in the mid-Atlantic, in DC the tide is about 2.5 ft, In Newport news its about... 3-4 feet. A tide is about 6 hours, so it is moving about 0.5 feet an hours. </p>
<p>In bay of Fundy (Nova Scotia), where there are 11 to 52 foot tides (2 to 10 feet an hour), plus it moves 174 miles over that time! </p>
<p>For groundwater, since it is so confined, changes in elevation and location of the groundwater is very slow. Since even in nicest fastest cleanest sand groundwater is going to have maximum velocity on the range of 3 feet a day... more likely its going to be 1 or 2 feet a day for a fast aquifer.</p>
<p>What this means to me, is that the impetus of the moon and the period of the tides is too short to make any change to groundwater elevations or conditions. By the time the groundwater begins to move, the gravitational pull has already long moved on, and is actually pulling the other way, no its pulling the first way again! This is continuous of course as the moon circles the earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm studying for a master's in water and earth science so by no means an expert. But I believe the changes caused by the gravitational pull are tiny, and only measured as a small water level fluctuations. Not at all on the scale normally associated with tidal movements seen on beaches or estuaries.</p>
<p>Interestingly tides and gravitational pull are being used to monitor other subsurface properties to understand more than just the water level fluctuations such as changes in water pressure etc. I read an article that described it as modelling the pressure decrease after removal of a certain amount of water and as such the reaction of the surface(ground) above this water level. </p>
<p>This is important because it'll help us understand ground subsidience if we're removing water (eg. In an aquifer). Understanding this reaction in the ground, described as like a sponge, will help us to model this subsidience. </p>
<p>So to answer your question again there isn't much impact on the actual water level but in terms of the impact on the ground above as we pump water out there could be an impact, and models are trying to predict this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a geotechnical engineer (not a hydrogeological engineer), but if I remember correctly, horizontal groundwater flows are defined by kD (m2/day, for coarse soil like sand) and vertical groundwater flows are defined by c (in days, for poorly permeable soils like clay and peat). </p>
<p>The values for c can be a couple days up to 1000-2000 days, therefore I think vertical groundwater flows are not likely to be affected at all. However, the horizontal flowing speed (m2/day) in coarse soil is usually significantly higher (the most recent case study I was involved in had a flow rate about 250 m2/day). </p>
<p>Apart from this, tides occur because large masses of water are pulled slightly to one side of the earth, forcing the ocean water to form a elliptical shape around the globe, causing the water level to rise or fall, depending where you are. Since groundwater behavior is restricted to a soil layer of limited dimensions (with significantly lower flowing rates than an ocean, for example), I think it's unlikely for the groundwater level to show (measurable) changes caused by the gravitational pull of the moon. Other factors such as temperature and permeability can cause much greater fluctuations in groundwater level.</p>
<p>But I'm by no means an expert, so if anyone disagrees, please let me know. I love to learn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little background to justify my comments.  I work in in the environmental field with a bachelor's in chemistry and my master's in environmental and public health.  I am currently working on a hazardous waste remediation site on the Atlantic coast where we routinely see 6-12 foot tides.  We monitor groundwater levels 6 times a day and sample the groundwater several times during the week.  </p>
<p>The answer to question is no, tides have no significant effect on the water table.  In coastal areas it does have an effect on the salinity of the ground water as you have an influx of salt water when the tide comes in and even then the changes in concentrations are very small.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, everything on Earth is affected by tidal forces but you have to understand what those actually are.</p>
<p>Tidal forces change the shape of &quot;equipotential surfaces&quot;. There are an infinite number of these surfaces on Earth and together they all form the overall volume of gravitational force on and inside the Earth. If two objects are on the same equipotential surface then they experience no difference in gravitational potential energy. If you have a large body of water then over a sufficient amount of time it's surface will tend to conform to that of an equipotential surface.</p>
<p>Now, what tidal forces acting on the Earth's oceans look like is a bit like taking a big deep pan of water and tilting it at different angles. When you do this the water will slosh back and forth and will adjust itself to the new &quot;level&quot; relative to the shape of the pan. If you do this very slowly then the water level relative to the sides will change to very precisely correspond to the different angles you hold the pan. If you do this a bit faster and rhythmically then there will also be a bit of &quot;sloshing&quot; and this will impact the water level on the sides of the pan at any given time, as well the shape of the pan.</p>
<p>In the case of the Earth the rotation of the Earth through the comparatively slowly changing tidal forces from the Sun and the Moon adds this rhythmic sloshing effect, so the local tidal motion and the high/low tide heights at any given location on Earth will vary depending on not just the tidal forces but also the overall shape of the body of water, the shape of the coastline and the dynamics related to those. Which is why the tide heights at different portions along a coastline can be significantly different even though the locations may not be very far from each other (this is especially true when the coastline becomes much more complex, such as with fjords).</p>
<p>OK, now, let's go back to that pan of water analogy for a second. Let's say you have an enormous container of water, let's say a hot tub that you've mounted on a tilting table and you tilt that table by a certain number of degrees back and forth. Think about how much the water level on each side of the hot tub is going to change. If the degree of tilt is significant, it might be a lot. Now let's say you have a coffee mug half full of water and you tilt it back and forth by the same amount as the hot tub. Is the height of the water on either edge of the mug going to change by the same amount as in the hot tub? No, there's not enough water in the mug for that to happen, the differences might be proportional to the size of the mug vs. the hot tub but the heights are not going to be anywhere near the same. The water in the hot tub could easily change height by several feet, but that's going to be impossible with your mug.</p>
<p>Now imagine that your mug is filled with a sponge. Tilting it back and forth will still cause the water level within to change, but it won't slosh around as much as in the empty cup. These same principles apply to the below ground water table. Changes in equipotential surfaces will result in forces acting on the water table, but those forces are mediated by the size of the body of water involved as well as any impediments against the effect of hydrostatic forces such as the semi-permiability of soils, etc. Look at, for example, the effect of tides on the Great Lakes in the US, which tend to be very small, a matter of a few centimeters different between high and low tide, down in the noise compared to other dynamic phenomena such as wave action. Then look at the extent of connected water tables, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogallala_Aquifer" target="_blank">Ogallala Aquifer</a> which have a similar size scale to some of the largest lakes but the water isn't just sitting in some enormous underground cavern, it exists in semi-permeable rock and soil, which resists the movement of water and dampens the impact of tidal forces on water level.</p>
<p>In short, tidal forces do impact groundwater but because those sub-surface bodies of water are not nearly as large in extent as oceans and because the water in semi-permeable rock and soil resists hydrostatic forces to a greater degree than open bodies of water the changes in those water levels due to the tides tend to be far, far less than the tides on the coast of a great ocean, a matter of at most a few centimeters in almost all cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
