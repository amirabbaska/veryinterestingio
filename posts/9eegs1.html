		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-016-1420-x" target="_blank">here</a>, scientists did a spot of dentistry on a 1.2 million year old Hominin skull and found our ancestors, who were duking it out on the open plains at the time, had excellent dental hygiene. Huh, how come?</p>
<p>Turns out, it was all to do with their raw diet. They found grass, seeds, and uncooked meat in plaque samples, along with wood fibers - which researchers believe may have fallen from the subjects' early improvised toothbrushes. As cooking hadn't yet been discovered, and raw food tends to be more fibrous than cooked, we reckon a lot of it got stuck between the teeth, leading individuals to pick at it constantly, thereby dislodging and preventing excessive plaque build up.</p>
<p>What's more, it's only once humans settled down and developed agriculture that our dental problems became, well, a problem. As soon as we started building homes and planting grains, so began our foray into carbohydrates - and it's these carbs and sugars that can break down into sugars in our mouths, providing food for the bacteria that cause tooth decay. </p>
<p>So, to answer your question, 'cavemen' didn't eat (much) sugar, and didn't have problems with tooth decay nor gum disease. They did however have problems with tooth wear, as the fibrous foods would constantly chisel down their teeth until they were worn flat, until eventually they'd have trouble eating.</p>
<p>For these reasons, dental hygiene was less essential than it is today with our heavy carb diets, but 'cavemen' did have other dental problems than cavities to contend with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problem for our modern teeth is we eat a lot of soft refined foods and a lot of sugar. That stuff just sits there and gets stuck which causes tooth decay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
