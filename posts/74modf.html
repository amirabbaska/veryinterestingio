<ol>
<li>
<p>Safety.  Car accidents are the #1 cause of death for officers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Space, they have a lot of gear and need seats big enough to get in and out with their vest and belt on, also a rear seat big enough to carry anybody that needs a ride.</p>
</li>
<li>Speed/handling  popular police cars (almost all American) have &quot;police packages&quot; from the factory.  They may have more horsepower, stiffer suspension, a pushbar front bumper.  The only time I remember departments going with foreign made vehicles was BMW motorcycles and that was because BMW covered maintenance.  </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least in Spain, usually the city council launches like a public contest (just really don't know the exact word) where they announce the requirements all the contestants need to meet, how much money will they spend, number of cars needed, in how much time will they need them, etc. They launch this for like 2 months for example.</p>
<p>In those 2 months different car makers appeal with their different models in which they can meet all the requirements.</p>
<p>When it finishes, the city council decides and chooses the one that meets all the requirements and is cheaper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with most government purchases, they come up with minimum requirements and solicit bids from manufacturers/dealers. Most departments try to buy the same vehicle every year, so that they can re-use parts.</p>
<p>In the US, only a few vehicles are offered by manufacturers as police vehicles. Some departments buy other models, but most stick to the models that the manufacturers certify for police duty. The Michigan State Police, with the support of some other agencies, runs a comparison every year and makes the results public:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, there are only a handful of models that car makers have created specific police versions for... currently, Ford makes versions of the Taurus and Explorer for police use. Chevy has a fleet-only Caprice model and also a version of the Tahoe. Dodge offer a Charger.</p>
<p>These models are all able to offer what police are looking for -- they generally want a larger sedan or SUV with upgraded engines, suspensions, space for gear, wiring for the additional electronics/communications, room to install a safety barrier between front and back seats, easy and cheap to repair. </p>
<p>Typically, the forces would put out requests for bids, specifying what they are looking for a getting bid to provide that... ie. they want 10 cars a year for next 5 years, with X, Y, Z features.</p>
<p>In the case of Chicago, our city specifically went with the Ford models during the last contract because those models are made here in Chicago so it's supporting local jobs/workers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We’re not lucky enough this side of the pond to have Police spec cars for our normal run of the mill cars. We’ll normally have something like a Ford Focus, Vauxhall Astra, or a generic family size hatchback with an engine less than 2.0. We are now going over to BMW 2 series however. </p>
<p>A lot of the time it is due to cost. However, sometimes it is due to the public perceptions and having existing contracts. For instance, we were offered a BMW fleet for a very good price. However, we would have had to change our maintenance contract as BMW would have wanted the servicing, and because they were concerned what he public would think if we were all driving around in BMWs. Hence we ended up with Hyundai i30s for a while, which are dreadful cars and completely unsuited. </p>
<p>Specialised units will have more specialised cars, with traffic having big Volvos or BMW estates because of the kit they carry, with armed Response having BMW X5s, again because of the weight of kit. </p>
<p>Also, we have completely different roads over here. As much as I’d want one, a Crown Vic isn’t suitable for a lot of our towns and cities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
