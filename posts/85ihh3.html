		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Replying as a serving submariner, so trying to use ELI5 terms:</p>
<p>The vast majority of depth changes are done using hydroplanes. Try keeping your hand flat (horizontal) and push it through water in your sink. It should move easily and you won't feel any push up or down.</p>
<p>Now do the same with your hand tilted upwards - you should feel a push up on the bottom of your hand.</p>
<p>By pushing themselves through the water using various means, and by altering the angle of their hydroplanes, the subs can dive or come shallow as they need.</p>
<p>Many submarines have two sets of hydroplanes, one at the forward end and one at the aft (rear)  end. The forward set of planes are the ones that primarily change depth, and the aft ones are used to control the boat's 'trim' (think angle of the boat with respect to the ground). You can still control the boat's depth using the aft ones if you had a problem with the forward ones though. </p>
<p>Now, what we haven't covered yet is buoyancy. The sub's weight changes as depth changes - the deeper you are, the denser you are as the boat gets squeezed tighter by the additional water above us. So you get this effect where if you're heavier than you should be, you might start going deep. This makes you compress, get more dense, and start going deep quicker etc etc. </p>
<p>Not good. </p>
<p>To counteract this, the Sub control team try and keep the buoyancy of the boat as close to neutral as possible - if we go a bit shallow, we bring some water into some of the tanks in the submarine, and if we go deeper we pump some water out, keeping us neutral. </p>
<p>You could use this effect to surface, but the pumps are pretty slow as they have to fight against sea pressure. It would take some time. </p>
<p>If you have an emergency and want to just get to the surface NOW, you can push out lots of water from tanks outside the submarine using high pressure air stored in large bottle groups. This will make us very buoyant and help get us to the surface, but uses up air which we can't get back until we have surfaced. Nothing beats having propulsion and planes to get us to the surface - if we were flooding and super-heavy, pointing up and pushing hard will get us back up there. </p>
<p>There are various systems that work in different ways involving these three methods - planes, pumping water and using high pressure air - but without going into (sometimes classified) detail these are the basic principles behind all of them. </p>
<p>Edit: clarified a sentence, and thanks for the gold! Now the wife thinks I'm Internet famous! (she does not use reddit despite my continued supply of r/aww pictures)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a sub like an airplane, and the water as air. Subs have what are called dive planes, which are essentially wings and can be rotated much like the flaps on an airplane.   Unless there is a major emergency, a sub always &quot;drives&quot; itself to the surface.  The high pressure air is what's called the emergency blow system, and is only used in an emergency.</p>

<p>Submarines use both buoyancy control (levels of air/ water (and even poop and oil) in various tanks) and their dive planes (wings like an airplane) to control depth. They can use one or both depending the mission/ reason for surfacing. It a complex dance, however, because the fine tuning of the buoyancy is slow to react and changes with water temp and how much the dive planes work depends on how fast the submarine is moving.
For periscope operations, you generally try to get the buoyancy neutral, or slightly negative, and control depth with just enough speed for the planes to work. (Slightly negative because it's better to sink the scope than pop up and be seen)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things going on.</p>
<p>First, lets talk about the small boats.  Small submarines, little research vessels.  For example, Alvin.  They build the submarine to be &quot;neutrally buoyant&quot;, that is, it won't sink or float, just stay where you put it in the water column.  </p>
<p>Use a small tank of air to stay floating, and then they fill that tank.  when they fill the tank, the boat sinks.  To surface, Alvin has some ballast it will drop, and the boat becomes buoyant again, and comes to the surface.    </p>
<p>For &quot;Big submarines&quot;, they're flown, much like airplanes.  They rarely sit still, and fly.  Going up and down, is done with dive planes, on the front and rear of the ship.  That's the &quot;first&quot; way that they control their depth.</p>
<p>You'll notice that big submarines sit WAY above the water when they're on the surface.  This is because they have really big tanks to provide flotation.  To go under water, they fill those tanks with water.  This is the second way they control their depth.</p>
<p>Now those big boats can change their weight quite a bit.  People and machinery move around a lot too.  Also, the density of water changes, both with temperature, salinity, and somewhat, depth.  The big submarines have trim tanks, and ballast systems to keep the boat veritcal (an even keel), and level horizontally (fore and aft).  Those trim tanks, also allow the boat to chose to rise, or submerge without moving forward.  </p>
<p>As long as the boat is moving, most controls are done with the dive planes.  </p>
<p>Hopefully that's ELI5 enough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
