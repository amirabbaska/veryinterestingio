		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yay, I can answer this. </p>
<p>Different meats have different fat, water, and amino acid ratios. Fish is a great example since it has a high nitrogen content and low fat content which promotes Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp to become the dominant microbe. </p>
<p>The animals also have different dominant bacteria when they are alive which will contaminate the meat to a certain extent as it's processed. How the meat is stored will also play a role (aerobic, anaerobic, refrigerated (to what temperature), what preservatives may have been added). </p>
<p>The bacteria that spoils the meat isn't necessarily the bacteria that might harm you. Often, spoilage microbes are not the ones you worry about, however their presence in high levels is an indicator that conditions have been ripe for microbial growth and therefore the ones that could harm you are also likely present in sufficient quantities to cause disease. </p>
<p>Another key indicator is pH. Poultry typically has a higher pH and therefore will spoil faster. Lactic acid bacteria will often proliferate in beef (which is what gives it the sour smell as it starts to go bad). They have the effect of lowering the pH which limits other spoilage microorganisms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Decomposition is mostly a matter of which microorganisms are best able to thrive in the medium.  The major differences between, e.g., beef, pork, and poultry will be in the ratios of fat and protein, connective tissue, etc., but also in what organisms are already present within the meat, giving them a huge advantage over those just landing on the surface from a touch or from the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
