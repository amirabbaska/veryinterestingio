Think of a polymer as a big pile of tangled spaghetti. When you bend it, the outside of the bend will be in tension and some spaghetti strands will break. As the polymer is pulled apart you are left with most of the crack open with a few <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sbasu/student_inputs/sudar_files/image002.jpg" target="_blank">strands left to bridge the gap</a>. This creates a tiny air pocket which gives a surface for light to refract. Thousands and thousands of these tiny cracks will scatter light as it passes through or reflects off the surface, giving it a milky white colour. </p>
<p>u/drawingthesun's explanation is good but for a very specific situation. Heating or stretching the polymer will cause crystallised regions to form and break, which will affect the way light is polarised as it goes through, but you need polarised filters to be able to see it. Frankly the article is junk, the picture is an image of oriented polymer viewed through partially crossed polarised filters. And the website is terrible: &quot;When polymers — such as plastics — experience stress&quot; yuck - what people call 'plastics' ARE actually polymers, 'plastic' just means that it will permanently deform when bent. The only relevant sentence in the entire thing is where it says 'can also cause molecular changes that lead to whitening' but then it just doesn't give you anything to tell you why.

<p>Polymers have highly ordered backbones but less ordered overall structure. When you bend a polymer, you apply a directional stress. The polymer strands become oriented with respect to one another and the non-backbone bonds fail long before the backbone bonds. Light reflects off the gaps formed by the partial failures in the material. Crazing does not occur in all polymers, as the ability to orient into highly ordered regions is dependant on the overall polymeric structure. Polymers with fewer, simpler, and/or smaller side groups tend to crystallize more easily. </p>
<p>Dowling's Mechanical Behavior of Materials covers crazing pretty well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>It seems to be because of ordered (crystalline) structures turning unordered when stressed. See source below.</del></p>
<p>Edit: Sorry it's the opposite! The plastic under stress actually causes these ordered (crystalline) structures to form. This causes the white colour. Thanks u/Coomb!</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit 2: Also read u/Jeygo comment too, they explain it very well and also mention that my source might not be very good.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;When polymers — such as plastics — experience stress, one of the most common reactions is a color change: they turn white at the point of stress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most polymers contain both crystalline (neatly ordered) and amorphous (unordered) areas on their molecular chains. Heating a polymer can cause the amorphous sections of the chain to crystalize. When that happens, the way the molecules scatter light changes and the plastic turns white.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply bending something out of shape, or making the repeated bending motions needed to break it entirely (think about that Wiffle bat), can also cause molecular changes that lead to whitening.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add my thoughts to this. I actually make plastic pipe in all different colors, the thing is 97% of the recipe is a clearish white compound even in black pipe and about 2% is colored dye. So while what others said is true the plastic is actually made up of a clear/white compound to begin with</p>
<p>Edit: the other 1% exists; it's just a different type of compound</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called Crazing. It's due from introducing stress into the material. It can be from being bent or from chemical change. But it goes both ways....some chemicals such as MEK actually slightly melt it creating a polished appearance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
