		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you move your eyes, it is called a &quot;saccade&quot;. This 'snapshot' happens because of what is known as &quot;saccadic masking&quot;, i.e. the brain cuts out some of the information coming from your eyes, just before and while your eyes are moving.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade#Saccades_and_vision" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade#Saccades_and_vision</a></p>
<p>In simple terms, when you move your eyes, your brain &quot;pauses the video&quot; for a split second, and so you see a &quot;frame&quot; with less motion in it, seemingly causing a 'freeze frame' effect. </p>
<p>Another way to notice this effect is explained on the wikipedia page - if you look in a mirror and look back and forth, you can't see your eyes moving.  Likewise, you don't see (much) motion blur when you look around quickly. Your brain hides the motion of your eyes from you, and so has to fill something in while your eyes are moving, which is where this effect comes from. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human eyes <strong>don't</strong> sample; they're continuous. There are no such things as snapshots with human optic nerves.</p>
<p>There's an interesting effect (that I think you're talking about) when you change where you're looking that is effectively a small lag built into your optical system. The brain takes information from the eyes, but to recognize an object as moving, your brain needs two measurements of the object: object A position 1 and object A position 2. This means that your brain needs more information before you perceive motion. A quick glance is not long enough to figure out motion like that.</p>
<p>The effect is most commonly observed (and most commonly posted to ELI5) as it applies to the second hand on a clock that seems to stop for longer than a second when you first look at the clock. That's because of this same effect. </p>
<p>tl;dr: Until the brain is sure something is moving, it won't perceive motion. To be sure, the brain needs more information than a quick glance provides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are very close to the line between vision/optics and brain/mind.</p>
<p>The eyes are part of your brain, you brain does all kinds of magic when it comes to vision. This is why optical illusions work.</p>
<p>In the case you ask about your brain can quickly assess the important things in the view behind you and can remember that few a few seconds in such a way the you see a snapshot.</p>
<p>The eyes are always sending the latest image in real time, the snapshot is done by the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
