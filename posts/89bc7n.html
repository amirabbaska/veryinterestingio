		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arrow range is very much dependent on aerodynamic stability. A longer arrow with stabilisation fins (fletching) goes a lot further than a stubby one without any fletching.</p>
<p>Crossbow bolts are generally shorter, and require different (sturdier, less aerodynamic) fletching that doesn't mind following a solid groove. This combination of shorter shaft length and heavier/smaller fletching reduces their long distance stability. </p>
<p>Penetration power is a function of the weight and speed of the projectile (and shape of the head, but let's assume that's equal for arrow and bolt). </p>
<p>Crossbows can use all kinds of mechanics for cocking the string (levers, ratchets etc.), and are potentially <em>much</em> stronger than any bow can ever be (the bow being dependent on the direct strength of its user). This allows crossbows to fire heavier and/or faster projectiles, providing more penetration power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Arrows being more aerodynamic means that the will slow down less over time, but the initial energy is relatively low, so less penetration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may be more of an /r/AskHistory answer, but I think a lot of it has to do with specific bow and arrow vs the specific crossbow. The English longbow had superior range <em>and</em> penetration to the French crossbows of the time. The results of which can be seen from the battles of Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt.  This was due to the insane draw weight plus the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodkin_point" target="_blank">bodkin point</a>, specially designed to pierce armor. </p>
<p>Recurves today don't have anything close to the draw weight of an English longbow because, unless you literally trained your whole life, nobody would be strong enough to pull it back. Conversly, crossbows made of composite fiberglass with  complex pulley systems outmatch anything a human could ever draw. I would argue the modern crossbow has a range and penetration superior to any bow and arrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The crossbow basically uses or requires more torque.  The longbow for example uses inertia.  It's easier to aim.  The reason for this is due to the cos value which represents the distance x away from the center of balance or the centroid of the crossbow's limb, and the distance y (sin) which is the distance of the tip of the limb/cam (where the string meets the cam) to the centroid of the limb.  Basically the more cos, the more torque, the more sin, the more inertia (intertia is the ability for an object to reach a point, by moving towards that point, such that the final result is a straight line, if zero torque is present (pure velocity).  Basically, some people may disagree with this, but very few people are able to use this term and its unit.  It exists.  Basically, inertia as an integer, determines in reference to a point, the slope towards that point, such that the degree to the curve of that slope, will determine the degree inertia, with a flat slope (completely flat [y=mx+b] representing only inertia).  An extremely curved slope (similar to a parabola) represents that fact that some torque is present.  Torque by itself, represents in reference to a point a movement perpendicular to that point, thus cos  can(although in trigonometry it defines the adjacent/hypotenuse) in this case be used to represent the amount torque based on the distance an object(in this case, the limb) has traveled perpendicular to a moment.  Since the limb of a crossbow typically has a greater value cos when compared to the sin value (the length of the limb from the moment to the tip), then it will use more torque. </p>
<p>This torque, can be translated from the moment used to measure torque in the limbs, to the arrow(very important I believe in history) via the string, and once transferred completely, allows the arrow to accelerate.  </p>
<p>Since cos =adjacent/hypotenuse, and since there is a movement which occurs, and thus the values are not measured based on one point in time, but instead on two points in time (initial, final), and along with this, can also be looked at in terms of a rate (from final back to the initial, plus excess movements related to equilibrium[vibrations for example, gyrations].  Since there are two cos values and since cos would technically represent the adjacent to a moment, and not the opposite, then some assumptions have to be made.  This is necessary.  </p>
<p>Since cos is an amount perpendicular to an angle, and the angle can be represented as the ratio between the value sin, and the value cos, on a cartesian graph, where two points for a bow would be present, representing the hypotenuse as a line from the point of the string, to the distance of the difference between the values found for cos.  This method combines some statics and experimental methods found in physics and chemistry. The difference for the amount cos represents the amount torque during the initial part of a sequence, defined by the pulling of the string back to a degree, and also when the string is released, and returns to the rest position.  The angle is simply the ratio, and to represent a triangle, will actually form the shape of a shock wave (straight, angled lines).  This angle is the sum of the two angles on either side, and represents a new value, for something which I am unable to completely comprehend.  It seems to be related to the number 2, which can either mean a square, or a coefficient.  This number eludes me, so I will continue on without it.</p>
<p>With some help, I was able to find that it represents on side of the equilibrium, with the other side being the half of 1.  This likely represents an amount compression versus an amount expansion.  The compression would be 1/2, where 2 is expansion.  The integer is squared if you solve for x in 1/2x=2(a/b).  </p>
<p>The best equation or graph I have found to represent the triangle is a line that represents the x axis in the middle of a bow, the moment at the origin (of the limb), and the hypotenuse to the sin value as a constant or the difference, sin this point or value would change as the bow is compressed and expanded (use).  The angle will be different for the two occasions and thus the difference can be found between these two ratios.  Inertia would be represented by sin (a force used to ensure the accuracy and precision of the bow[where torque represents the amount of acceleration necessary].  </p>
<p>The acceleration thus is necessary and answers your question.</p>
<p>The greater acceleration will be from the greater cos value techpiece, which in this case is the crossbow.  The ratio between the crossbow and bow when compared shows that the crossbow has more torque, and the bow has more sin.  Thus with the bow, since sin and distance are related, then we can perhaps say that the bow will achieve a greater distance, especially as the angle of the arrow has a greater sin value vs the cos value.  As the cos value increases for the type of bow(the difference in cos values from open and closed), torque will increased, as well as required torque to function.  Since torque will determine acceleration, then the arrow will travel further under a shorter period of time, such that time appears to be differentiating itself over and over again, where the greater amount of time is further from the bow, and the less amount of time is near the bow.  With this in mind, the torque will allow the bow to travel a constant amount under different amounts of time.  It can also be a different amount of distance, over a constant amount of time, depending on which direction the equation is used for.  </p>
<p>Since we used the limb's center as a moment, where the arrow must cross this equilibrium, then the behavior that occurs is a cos behavior(this behavior is defined by a half-integer[basically a plus sign/negative sign] that goes from positive to negative[algebra].  </p>
<p>If it did not cross this moment (meaning the archer is a poor archer), then a sin behavior would occur across equilibrium, and this is when the half-integer remains the same.  </p>
<p>part 2
The material used likely is based also on cos/sin values, where sin represents the ability to expand, and cos the ability to compress, and if these two values are great enough (as if on a number line, negative as sin, cos as positive), then the amount energy, as a sum of the two numbers in terms of absolute value[|cos(value)+sin(value)|] is the amount energy.  The units used are the units that represent the ability of a material to expand (in terms of the molecular structure), and compress(also molecular structure).  Since expansion and compression are sin and cos respectively, then the more the molecules can expand (without tears or cracks occurring due to probably another set of cos and sin forces[perhaps bonding and antibonding behavior]), the greater the value of sin.  The more they can compress, the greater the cos value.  Metals for example expand and compress under different temperatures, and if the difference is enough, then it begins to crack.  This is to be avoided, so materials that do not crack are basically materials that have extremely high values of this unit.  The unit is basically defined as the material's ability, in terms of the molecules themselves to change in density as a whole(nano), as well as expand and compress(and for a bow and arrow, not crack or crease(same thing really it seems)).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
