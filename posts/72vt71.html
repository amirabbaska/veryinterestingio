<p>&quot;If you received a robocall from Carnival, Norwegian or Royal Caribbean, you might want to enter your phone number on a class-action website.</p>
<p>A class-action lawsuit against those cruise lines and Resort Marketing Group means you might get between $300 to $900 for the calls.&quot;</p>
<p>Heard about this lawsuit on the radio. Robocalls like this are illegal and you might actually be victim of the specific ones in this recently won lawsuit. </p>
<p>Cross your fingers :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something about this- if you get an unidentified call and the person/machine on the other end asks &quot;Hi, is this OP?&quot; do not say &quot;Yes.&quot;  There have been complicated phishing scams where they record your verbal &quot;yes&quot; and create &quot;recordings&quot; of you agreeing to things with your credit card number, birthday, and phone number.  Ask who is calling, and only if it is someone who you actually want to talk to, then proceed.  Until you get a positive ID on who is calling, say as little as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Another method is when they call ask them who hey are calling from... ask them to spell the name of the company.. when they start to spell ask them to go slower.. and slower and say stupid stuff like 'T for pool???' Ask for the number- ask if you can put them on hold- ask what they had for lunch and their opinion on your lunch. They will stop calling </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
