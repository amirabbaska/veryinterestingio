		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those saying there is no correlation simply because OP did not cite any, a number of studies have found correlations. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27642659" target="_blank">This study</a> suggests the causation is from personality (empathy as a trait) to behavior (preference for reading fiction). This interpretation comes from an observed correlation between lifetime exposure to fiction, but no experimental effect of reading fiction on empathy, as does <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095740" target="_blank">this study</a>. My guess is the original study that DID find a causal relationship is an example of publication bias, but it should also be pointed out that the strengths of the manipulations (i.e., how much fiction the participants read) may not have been sufficient to induce a change in empathy.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the logic correctly the idea that reading fiction increases empathy posits the following</p>
<p>You read about other people in strange situations &gt; this helps extend your suspension of disbelief &gt; this expands your imagination &gt; this allows you to easier accept real world situations that are otherwise different than yours</p>
<p>I'm going to first levy some important questions before I dive into the scientific literature. </p>
<p>Firstly, does the genre of fiction matter? Would someone reading military fiction experience the same levels of empathy that someone who reads national geographic or women's fiction? </p>
<p>Secondly, reading ability correlates with wealth, life expectancy, education and a lot of other factors that can influence your ability to experience a broader world. If you showed a person various picture book would they experience a rise in empathy? </p>
<p>Thirdly, how do you empirically measure empathy? Unless you can peer into a persons mind you can't tell how they <em>actually</em> felt someone felt, but how they expected someone to feel. For instance, if they used the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775495/" target="_blank">Toronto Empathy Questionnaire</a> they'd run into the problem of self-reporting. Testing empathy is <em>really</em> complicated and an inexact science. </p>
<p>Lastly, are these increases in empathy meaningful statistically, long lasting and are these increases in empathy limited to the subjects of the books (for instance if you read women's fiction will you be more empathetic exclusively toward women) or do they truly broaden a persons ability to empathize in general? </p>
<hr />
<p>I'm currently going off of Dr. Emanuele Castano's <a href="http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Science-2013-Kidd-science.1239918.pdf" target="_blank">study report</a> which has been widely cited about this subject and has multiple studies with replicated results. </p>
<p>Genre is important: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our contention is that literary fiction, which we consider to be both
writerly and polyphonic, uniquely engages the psychological processes
needed to gain access to characters’ subjective experiences. Just as in
real life, the worlds of literary fiction are replete with complicated individuals
whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They only measured short term benefits and self-reporting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our findings demonstrate the short-term effects of reading literary
fiction. However, taken together, the relation between the Author
Recognition Test and ToM performance and the finding that it is specifically
literary fiction that facilitates ToM processes suggest that reading
literary fiction may lead to stable improvements in ToM. Since the Author
Recognition Test does not distinguish between exposure to literary
and popular fiction, additional research with refined methods is necessary
to test this important hypothesis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also did a replications of their work in their experiments to isolate further variables. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fifth experiment (22) aimed to replicate experiment 4 and test for
the influences of subject variables (i.e., education, age, gender) and possible
confounds with a larger sample (N = 356). As in experiments 3 and
4, three works of literary fiction were taken from a collection of the 2012
PEN–O. Henry Prize winners (30) and three works of popular fiction
from an anthology (29).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'd need an educated social psychologist and a statistician to break down exactly how the tests they used and their statistical conclusions support their thesis, but considering the replication and multiple testing methods I feel confident in the following conclusion...</p>
<p><strong>Empirical data supports that reading fiction does improve empathy, however it is limited to literary fiction and there is no data (that I have found) that can support statements of long term benefits.</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at the work of Lisa Zunshine and Theory of Mind.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I used it in research, but if I remember rightly, reading fiction activates mirroring in the neurons as we, the reader, develop a Theory of Mind for the imagined characters. This may not cause us to feel more sympathetic to a character, rather it hones our ability to create more accurate Theories of Mind as we the reader engages with literary devices (foreshadowing, priming, cues, etc.) to make sense of the story.  As a reader gets better at this sort of mini-game within stories, while some of the skills are transferable to real life, they will also enjoy reading more as they're able to gain more from it. </p>
<p>So in short, both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some research that suggests that reading literary fiction can increase empathy:</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055341" target="_blank">Matthijs Bal &amp; Veltkamp (2013)</a> collected, among other things, subjects empathy scores on the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire (i.e. assessing the extent to which statements such as &quot;I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.&quot; apply to you) and then gave subjects texts to read before re-assessing their scores. The texts were either literary fiction or non-fiction (newspaper articles). They showed that a person's empathy score increases after reading literary fiction, but specifically if subjects reported being absorbed and emotionally transported into the story.</p>
<p>There was also the study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1239918" target="_blank">Kidd &amp; Castano (2013)</a> who measured empathy more directly by asking subjects to identify emotions of facial expressions. Participants assigned to read literary fiction performed better than participants assigned to read something else. The authors interpreted the results as suggesting that fiction can promote a Theory of Mind, which is the skill of understanding others' mental states. </p>
<p>While these are some small short-term effects, there seems to be some evidence for a causal effect of reading fiction on empathy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
