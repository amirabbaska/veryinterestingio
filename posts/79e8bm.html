		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture a tube of tennis balls, with both ends cut off. </p>
<p>Direct current is when you take a ball and push it in one end, causing one at the other end to pop out. </p>
<p>Alternating current is when you push a ball in one end and it pops one out the other, then push one in the other end and pop one out the former. </p>
<p>Over time, for constant frequency AC, the total change in distance for any ball inside the tube is 0. </p>
<p>Does that answer your question? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for the answer to the question - yes. </p>
<p>I am going to use this question as an opportunity to clear up some misconceptions that people have. Almost no layman correctly understands electricity. People usually think, that electricity is some magic substance, say electrons, that is &quot;produced&quot; in the power plants, transported through the wires into your house where your appliances &quot;consume&quot; it. Similar to gas or water. <strong>But that's exactly how it doesn't work.</strong></p>
<p>The best analogy for understanding the AC system, is to imagine that instead of an electrical socket, a rotating axle is sticking out of your wall. Actually, in the early days of industrialization, that's how factories worked. They had a huge steam engine in the basement which was connected to the belt, gear and axle system. This system distributed the rotating movement around the building and all the machines on the factory floor were hooked to this single steam engine. </p>
<p>So in a totally same way, your little axle in the electric socket is connected all the way to the power station that has a huge rotating engine inside. Whenever you want to power some appliance, you just hook it up to the axle and draw the rotating motion out of it. </p>
<p>So the electrons are not the electric energy itself, they are the &quot;axles and belts&quot;, that just carry the force (the rotating motion) produced at the power plant, right to your home.</p>
<p>This analogy is very precise. It explains all the things about the AC system like:</p>
<p><strong>Why does the production of an electric power always have to equal the consumption?</strong></p>
<p>What happens when you reach the top of the hill in a car, and keep up the constant press on the accelerator pedal? You will start speeding up! Your engine suddenly produces more power than the car needed when going uphill, so it has to go somewhere. On the contrary, If you reach another, steeper hill, and don't press the pedal enough, you will eventually lose your speed and stop. </p>
<p>Literally the same thing happens to the AC electrical system. All the power plants rotate at the same rate of 50-60 revolutions per second (depending on your country). If not enough consuming devices &quot;brake&quot; the common axle, it will really start to rotate faster and faster. If there is too much load, it will eventually bring all the system to a grinding halt. </p>
<p><strong>What happens when I cut the wires that go from a power plant?</strong></p>
<p>The plant engine will suddenly lose all the load and will start spooling up like crazy, just like your car when you lift the wheels up from the ground. The operators will have to enact some emergency procedure of reducing the power quickly, like for example, release the steam that drives the turbine.</p>
<p>On the other side of the system, all the rotating engines in all the other power plants will start slowing down, because the load is higher than they can produce. If the network operator does not have a backup engines that are ready fill the missing power quickly, the easiest solution that saves the whole network, is just to sacrifice some part of it and &quot;cut off&quot; some of the load.</p>
<p><strong>What power plant am I drawing power from?</strong></p>
<p>In a sense, from all of them. All of them are hooked to the same &quot;axle&quot; and all consumers are drawing the rotating motion from it. You cannot point to a single power plant that powers you right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the electrons move very little in AC. They mostly just vibrate in place. What actually carries the power is the changing electric field. So yes, electrons do move, but their movement is not as important as the movement of the field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yea basically. Have you seen models for how sound waves propagate, with air molecules moving back and forth around their individual equilibrium points?  Exactly the same idea, just with electrons moving in a conductor instead of the motion of molecules in a  gas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the electrons do move back and forth, buy I want to point out that, in an electrical circuit, the electromagnetic field is what carries the vast majority of the energy. The electrons move like 0.1 cm/s, but in the field, the signal propogates at a speed close to c.</p>
<p>Edit: electrons speed is actually much much less than 0.1cm/s !! My bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
