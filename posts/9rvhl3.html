		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought I'd put my two cents in as someone who sews her own pocket extensions and never carries a purse. I do think the main two reasons are that (a) women's clothing is all about looks, and lumps from things in pockets ruin nice, smooth silhouettes of clothing, and (b) clothing manufacturers want to sell purses. But the often-overlooked factor is that standard hip-front pockets are impractical with pants that are relatively form-fitting, especially with the size of modern smartphones. I choose one of the smallest smartphones on the market (5&quot;) for that reason.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to fit a phone in a hip-front pocket like the standard ones on jeans. One is to make the pocket taller, so that the phone lays lengthwise down the thigh. Problem is, when the jeans are decently tight, it becomes impossible to get the phone out if you're sitting down, and difficult when you're standing up. Alternative is to lengthen the pockets widthwise. This is what I do, but the phone definitely cuts into my hip bone when I'm sitting and it sticks out and makes a very obvious angular silhouette.</p>
<p>Ideally, the solution would be to move to pockets on the sides of the thighs (like cargo pants and some new workout tights have), but (a) this would definitely ruin the nice &quot;lines&quot; of the sides of the legs, and (b) we're kind of used to seeing pants with front-hip and back pockets. Personally, I couldn't care less about the side lines: I think side-pockets are the most convenient shit ever.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of these issues might be avoided by not wearing tight pants. I can't speak for all women, but why do <em>I</em> wear tight pants? It's mostly for the look, but I've also discovered it's partially because my narrowest point (waist) is a lot higher than men's (just above the hips), so unless I wear really high-waisted pants, they're a lot more likely to slip down unless they're holding on by the thighs and butt.</p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about this, in case it wasn't obvious.</p>
<p>Edit: wording</p>
<p>Edit2: Please stop telling me to get over it and wear men's pants. (1) I wear a size 00 short, so I'm stuck with boys pants, which are invariably lower quality fabrics and construction. (2) I tried wearing men's pants for a year or so in high school. They fell down constantly, and belts + thick men's jeans was too bulky and heavy, and way less comfortable than my current solution. Wearing tight, stretchy jeans is not only more attractive for me, it's also significantly more comfortable and they stay up more easily. (3) I'm not looking for solutions or advice. At the beginning of my comment, I said that I sew extensions into my jeans. I am happy enough with this solution, which I settled on after roughly 17 years of search and experimentation, and in other comments I have indicated that there are other solutions I could implement if I didn't care about the way the jeans looked on the outside--which I do, and that's okay. None of my comment was intended to be a complaint. I was answering this man's question because I have put a lot of thought into this and had come up with several processes that I thought might explain the phenomenon in question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It used to be, back in the day, that pockets were separate article of clothing. You would put on your skivvies, then you would put on your pants, then you would put on your pockets, then you would put on your trousers or dress. Trousers and dresses would just have slits where you could reach through them and into your pockets. </p>
<p>After a while men's Pockets began to be sewn directly into the trousers; however women's Pockets needed to be far too big to do that, so the retained free floating pockets. </p>
<p>Women's Pockets eventually became more ornate and embroidered and things like that. They essentially became an extra piece of lingerie. When the French Revolution happened pockets on women were seen as a mark of the &quot;Upper Class&quot; and were replaced with handbags.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
