I understand that sheep need to stay warm in wet conditions and cotton plants don't.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers have not covered one of the most important reasons: cotton soaks up and holds on to more water than wool. Most of this water only leaves the clothing by evaporation and evaporation takes a lot of heat away from your body. Cotton will get wet easily and stay wet for much longer than most other fabrics. More water = more heat loss.</p>
<p>Why? Wool fibres have a <a href="http://www.terralana.co.nz/images/woolfibrexsection-fade.jpg" target="_blank">scaly coating that repels water</a> while <a href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/conservation/departments/science/Sci-images/lightbox-LM/sem-image-of-cotton-fibres.png" target="_blank">cotton fibres do not have this</a>. Also, cotton is made of cellulose, the same stuff that paper is made from, which is very effective at absorbing water. Weight for weight, cotton will absorb more water than wool. Cotton &quot;holds on to&quot; the water more than wool. When knitted together into a fabric, cotton effectively acts as a sponge. So, when a cotton garment gets wet it will be holding more water for longer compared to a woolen garment. When soaking some of this water can drip off, but after a point the main way in which the clothing dries is by evaporation. </p>
<p>Synthetic fibres are even better in this regard than wool, they absorb very little water, especially when wrung out after soaking. </p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> This topic is often mentioned in outdoorsy contexts because, in a cold environment (not much sun) without a fire, the only real source of heat can be your own body heat. In these cases, cotton clothes are a significant liability because it can be almost impossible to dry them out, making them worthless. Plus they weigh a lot more when wet which is a pain if you have to carry them in your pack!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised no one has mentioned dead air space yet.  Essentially, the reason clothing keeps you warm is because it's able to trap the air between your skin and your shirt that your body's metabolism has already warmed.  When cotton gets wet, the fibers collapse and there is no longer any dead air space to hold that warmed air.  Wool and other synthetic fibers such have much sturdier fibers that hold their shape even when wet.  Thus, even when wet, a wool shirt is going to continue trapping a lot of your body heat while cotton will just release it back to the environment.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It keeps you warm without overheating your body and in the Sahara Desert, Bedouins wear thin wool to keep them cool in the searing heat. The secret to both of these facts are the tiny pockets of air within each wool fiber that provide both insulation.  Wool is also able to soak up as much as 30 percent of its own weight in moisture without feeling wet, which is one of the reasons it can still keep you warm even in the rain. The fibers have a natural crimp that helps to wick moisture away from the body. Getting this moisture off your bare skin is a key element to keeping warm in wet conditions. The crimp in the wool fiber forces each strand to butt against each other, as opposed to lining up side by side or laying down flat together. This keeps the tiny air pockets intact, acting as little insulators -- the key to being able to keep you both warm and cool. When air is contained in very small pockets, it can't circulate easily, so heat is retained. Wool fibers are made up of cortical cells, and these cells are wrapped in cuticle. This scaly outer layer is then covered by yet another layer, the epicuticle -- a filmy skin that helps to repel moisture. What's more, the epicuticle also helps out in high humidity because it has tiny pores that draw in the moisture vapor to the center of the fiber where it's absorbed by a chemical process. The hydrogen bond of water, H2O, is actually broken, creating a chemical reaction with the wool fiber molecules to generate heat when it has taken on a lot of moisture.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The insualtion comes from trapped air. Wool has natural oil on the fibres so that the water tends to bead on the surface leaving lots of air in the material. With thinner cotton the water wicks straight through, giving nice thermal conducting water path from the skin to the outside.</p>
