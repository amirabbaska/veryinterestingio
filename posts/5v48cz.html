		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was very effective against unsupported cavalry. At Waterloo, for example, French cavalry fruitlessly tried attacking allied/British infantry in squares for an extended period of time. Forming a square was a purely anti-cavalry tactic, as it had weaknesses, but it worked for at least three reasons (this list is probably not exhaustive):</p>
<ol>
<li>As others have pointed out, there is no flank and all fronts.</li>
<li>Horses will not charge into things.</li>
<li>Squares are much more densly packed with arms than cavalry.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order, cavalry charging out of where you did not expect them to come and hitting your flanks or rear is an infantry nightmare. Squares prevent this by making sure there are no flanks. Wherever the cavalry is, it is facing an infantry front. This is no fun for the cavalrymen.</p>
<p>And unlike what some will have you believe, horses will not charge into things. They will no more run madly into a wall of bayonets and musket fire than you will run into a wall unflinchingly. Anyone who has ever been on a horse will know this. The nearest thing to this happening was at García Hernández in 1812 when a mortally wounded horse stumbled into a square like a ram and thrashes about (opening the path to other cavalry which charged into the square and - unsurprisingly - had a field day as all the enemy were suddenly showing their rear).</p>
<p>Finally, the firepower and bayonets of a square made it almost impenetrable to cavalry. Squares at Waterloo were mostly four ranks deep. The first rank would kneel and plant the musket butt in the ground, with fixed bayonets, creating a wall of spears. The other ranks were free to fire. The infantrymen would stand more or less shoulder to shoulder, many deep, meaning there were a lot of musekts and bayonets pr yard of square front. The cavalry, on the other hand, would ride about outside the square, needing room to manouvre, with considerable space between the horses, all the time sitting on an unstable platform (the horse moving about) whilst the infantry was densely packed and standing on firm ground. The disparity in volume of fire over the fronts of the squares was tremendous, meaning for every carbine or pistol the cavalrymen could fire at the square, many, many times that number of muskets would fire back.</p>
<p>The weakness of the square was if it was broken, which it sometimes was when infantry panicked, it was done for. Then it became a death trap. Interestingly, in the movie Waterloo (1970) which was filmed with Red Army extras in huge numbers both as infantry and cavalry, you can in some scenes see squares disintegrating. These were extras in a movie - perfectly safe- but apparently the experience was still scary enough to break them. The real thing must have been very tough going.</p>
<p>The other problem was the density. If cavalry was supported by infantry or artillery, the cavalry could force the enemy to maintain a square and then artillery would have a field day with an enemy presenting a perfect target. This was much of the reason for horse artillery, which could keep up with cavalry and help it defeat infantry squares. Or supporting infantry would be able to deploy in line and overwhelm the square with more efficient infantry tactics (essentially having all the infantry face one side of the enemy square, where three quarters of the square would be unable to use their weapons against them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A well disciplined square formation was absolutely very effective against cavalry (although by no means immune) but only if done right. </p>
<p>First, there's no flank or rear to attack, which is the ideal tactic when using cavalry. In a square formation, all your weapons are facing outward.</p>
<p>Second, horses have the same self preservation instinct as humans but without military training, and and such, they won't willing run into volley fire or a wall of bayonets. A well timed square could catch a cavalry charge off guard and take large numbers of them out with volley fire and impale the rest with bayonets.</p>
<p>The flip side is that a poorly timed or executed square could quickly turn into a death trap. If the square formed too early or didn't time their fire correctly, the cavalry could regroup at a safe distance and harass them back with their own fire. Worse, infantry support could surround the square and attack or hold them in place under artillery fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advantage that cavalry has over infantry is in speed and mobility.</p>
<p>A square formation helps counter this in two way </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's hard to flank - if the cavalry attempts to go around and attack on the side, the essentially encountering another front</p>
</li>
<li>Because it's several lines deep it can't be charged over (and allow the cavalry to return for a second charge). The horses get &quot;bogged&quot; down and are easier to fight back against. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cavalry was usually still going to be much more effective against infantry in almost any situation though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cavalry moves much faster than infantry, so it can always out-maneuver infantry and attack from the weakest side.  A square equalizes the firepower in all directions so there is no 'weakest side'.  (Note: a mathematician might quibble with using a square, but you also need a formation that can be easily assumed by infantrymen jostling in relation to one another).</p>
<p>The reason they used the square was that it was effective.  Firearms were very inaccurate, so you really needed mass volley fire to do much good.  If you had a situation where isolated infantrymen were put up against cavalry, they normally wouldn't be able to do much because the cavalry could close faster than they'd be able to land a lucky shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
