		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cooking, eating, washing dishes, and getting rid of trash all took a lot longer and was less effective before we standardized dish sizes, cooking instruments, had a stove and a dishwasher, and were able put all the trash on the curb where it magically disappears later.  Frameworks represent standards, appliances, garbage collection, and easy means of getting things to and from your code/house to remote locations/landfills that you haven't the slightest idea about how they work.  Additionally,  If you write your code to the framework, you can be sure it will work on anything that the framework says it can run on.  In the case of Windows .NET, that means 'any' version of Windows.  In the case of DotNetCore, that's starting to mean 'any' modern device.  There's a few asterisks in there, but that wouldn't be ELI5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When making a piece of software, like an app for a phone or a website, programmers need to do a lot of common tasks, like joining the word ‘Hello’ with your name to make a greeting or sending a file across the internet. To make the software do this from scratch requires a lot of time and effort and knowledge about the physical machine.
The .NET Framework has a lot of the common stuff already written for programmers to use so that they can concentrate on the things that make software brilliant like ease of use and useful features. It also means they don’t have to worry about their code not working on a particular computer as if the framework can be installed then their code will work too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The .NET Framework is two main things:</p>
<p>1- A standard library - this is a very large set of built in functions and classes, so when a programmer needs to do something like get the square root of a number, or get the content of a web page, they can use the standard framework classes and it's fast and easy.</p>
<p>2- A virtual machine - .NET runs on a virtual machine, like java, so when they port the framework to various systems you get almost automatic cross platform support.</p>
<p>Bonus: The .NET framework supports awesome languages such as C# and F#</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some things most programs need to do.  Access a database.  Talk to another program over the internet.  Ask a user for some information.</p>
<p>Frameworks, such as .net, do this for programmers.  Thus they don't need to worry about the HOW of what they want to do, they can worry about the WHY and WHAT they they want to do.</p>
<p>.Net is a little different that other frameworks in that it is an embrella.  Where other tech stacks (lists of technologies a company uses) may list a half dozen or more frameworks, each solving a different problem, .net provides a &quot;one stop shop&quot; to solve those problems, all which play nicy with each other.</p>
<p>Companies like frameworks as it keeps the coders focused on their problems and engaged in interesting work.  Programmers like frameworks as it helps get rid of the tediousness of the job, and helps make jumping jobs easier (I may not knoe the business your company is in, but I can listen to the people who do and know the frameworks you use).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The .NET framework is basically Microsoft Java. Just like how Java makes sure a programmer can write a program once, and it works roughly the same &quot;everywhere,&quot; the .NET framework ensures that a programmer can write a program once, and it'll run on any version of Windows, provided the right version of the framework is installed. It also accomplishes this in a very similar fashion to Java.</p>
<p>The .NET Core is Microsoft's open source version of this intended to work everywhere, from phones to Linux to Mac to windows computers.</p>
<p>Edit to add: I write .NET applications in C#</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
