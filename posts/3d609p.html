		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand the Manhattan Project you have to understand the problems facing nuclear bomb production and how the project tackled them. There are two main issues in building a bomb, both with significant depth of details. One is materials, you need a fissile material suitable for use in an unmoderated fast-fission chain reaction. In the 1940s the candidates for such materials were U-235, U-233 (bred from Thorium-232), and Plutonium (primarily Pu-239). The downside of all of these is they are hard to produce, which turns out to be somewhat advantageous for the human race because it means it's not easy to make nuclear weapons. U-233 and Plutonium both require operating a nuclear reactor which serves as a prodigious source of neutrons which transmutes natural materials, that can then be chemically separated later. U-235 is naturally occurring but only in extremely low abundance as a tiny fraction of natural Uranium so isotopic separation at industrial scales is required.</p>
<p>The second issue is assembly, and this adds even more complexity. With highly enriched Uranium (mostly U-235) speed of assembly isn't enormously important. Assembling the critical mass at speeds similar to that of a bullet being fired works, and this is where the &quot;gun-type&quot; bomb design comes from. A sub-critical mass of U-235 is fired at another sub-critical mass, when they slam together they create a mass that is beyond critical, and in a matter of micro-seconds a multi-step fission chain reaction occurs which releases terajoules of energy. With Plutonium there is an issue known as &quot;pre-detonation&quot; which prevents the use of a gun-assembly design. Any amount of bred Plutonium will contain a family of Plutonium isotopes, including things like Pu-240 which has a very high spontaneous fission rate, resulting in a large latent population of neutrons in the fissile material. What can happen is that during assembly if there are enough neutrons around then they can prematurely kick off a fission chain reaction at a time when the assembly is only just barely critical, and not in a super-critical state. The problem here is that nuclear reactions release vastly more energy than chemical reactions, and they proceed at a much faster rate. So a just barely critical chain reaction will rapidly develop enough energy to heat up and vaporize the entire bomb, and in so doing cause the bomb's components to spread apart, which then puts the bomb into a non-critical state, halting further nuclear reactions. If this happens at the instant that the bomb achieves critical mass then perhaps only a tiny amount of the potential nuclear energy is released, just around enough to vaporize the bomb, but not the kilotons of explosive yield desired. In gun-type designs the speed of assembly is so slow that the chance of a pre-detonation &quot;fizzle&quot; becomes very high when used with Plutonium. That's why implosion assembly was developed, because it creates a super-critical mass/density much faster and due to the inertia of the implosion shockwave results in the core being in a critical state for long enough to allow for a full nuclear yield. Keep in mind that maintaining criticality in a bomb core for merely 10 additional nanoseconds can essentially double the yield, and that'll give you a sense of the forces, time scales, and margins involved.</p>
<p>Back to materials. In the early 1940s nobody knew how to do bulk isotopic separation and several different techniques were in contention including thermal diffusion, gaseous diffusion, centrifugation, and electromagnetic separation. Each of which would require massive, complex, expensive, and extremely high-tech industrial facilities. Obtaining highly enriched Uranium would make it possible to build bombs using a sure-fire weapon design, gun-assembly. On the other hand, in principle breeding Plutonium was much easier, it required only operating a nuclear &quot;pile&quot; or reactor and pulling out Uranium periodically for processing, the reactor wouldn't even need to produce power, it just needed to produce neutrons. However, the implosion design was very sophisticated and untested, so it was a risk to pursue, though it offered the promise of being more efficient in terms of nuclear material used.</p>
<p>Here's the most important thing to understand about the Manhattan Project. At this point you see a huge variety of options of nuclear materials, production methods, and bomb designs. The sensible thing to do would be to do some degree of investigation into each aspect and then pursue the most promising alternatives. That's not what the Manhattan Project did, instead they pursued <em>every</em> route to the bomb. Simultaneously. That's how they achieved building nuclear weapons only 8 years after the discovery of the phenomenon of nuclear fission. They pursued both implosion assembly and gun-assembly. They looked at U-233 and discovered it was too hard to produce and to make into bombs. They pursued both Plutonium production and Uranium isotopic separation. They pursued every method for enriching Uranium and it turns out that what seemed to be the most promising one initially (centrifugation) was actually not very feasible with the technology of the time (and would not be until around the 1960s or so). Ultimately enriched Uranium was produced using each of the different techniques (thermal diffusion, electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion) as separate stages in a multi-step process (after the war the US focused on gaseous diffusion).</p>
<p>One thing to note about the &quot;Little Boy&quot; bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, the design was never tested before its use. That's how fool-proof the design was considered to be. Although it used so much Uranium (60 kg) that it would not have been feasible to run a test regardless.</p>
<p>Ultimately the answer to your question is that the Manhattan Project was in a break-neck dash to produce nuclear weapons using any methods possible. And the reason why the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were different is mostly because those were the bombs that were available at the time. Additionally, there was a greater capacity to build Plutonium fueled bombs because there was far more Plutonium available (as a multiple of bomb cores) than Uranium.</p>
<p>Also, it's possible to use Uranium in implosion assembly designs, but because the critical masses are different the specifics of the design are different as well. The US decided not to pursue a Uranium fueled implosion design during the initial Manhattan Project (though they would later build such bombs).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite simply because we couldn't make enough Uranium in time. Enriching uranium (especially to the levels needed for a bomb) is a very complex process. </p>
<p>Natural uranium is about 99% Uranium 238, and only 1% Uranium 235. Only the Uranium 235 is useful for making bombs, so the Uranium has to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium" target="_blank">enriched</a>- meaning separating out the 235 from the 238. The first bomb used Uranium which was enriched to 80% ^(235)U. </p>
<p>Plutonium bombs are much harder to build, but plutonium is much easier to enrich. This required us to develop two bombs, but we would have never had enough enriched uranium in time to build a second bomb should have we not switched to plutonium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real question is why didn't Little Boy use Plutonium - originally, both devices were going to use Plutonium.  It's easier to get than weapons grade Uranium, and you need less of it (critical mass of P-238 is just 9kg vs 52kg for U-235).</p>
<p>Originally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Man_(nuclear_bomb\)" target="_blank">Thin Man</a> bomb design was the preferred design, and it would have used Plutonium.  It was a gun style bomb but they weren't sure if it would work because Plutonium tends to go boom really easily.  Spoiler alert:  it wouldn't work, so they fell back on Uranium.  Uranium will work in a gun-style device, so Little Boy was born because the gun design is very simple and they weren't sure the implosion design wouldn't work at all.</p>
<p>Fat Man was an implosion bomb, which was much more difficult to build.  The implosion idea was unpopular and technically challenging, but it is more efficient and overall a better design.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Princeton senior engineering student, John Aristotle Phillips, wrote a 40-page physics term paper in 1976 giving the design of plutonium bomb. The cost was $152,000 USD ($643,000 in 2015), $150,000 of which was allocated to the plutonium. It was the size of a beachball and the weight was 125 lbs. (57 kg). Phillips used non-classified government publications, however page 20 of his paper which detailed the trigger was withheld from the public. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It simply came down to amount of fissile material available. When the Manhattan project started the U.S. had basically 0 fissile material. The fastest way to get fissile material in time for two bombs was to get both plutonium 239 and uranium 235. They had different processes and were manufactured at different places. They probably also wanted some redundancy so if one material was too slow they still had the other. It took about two years to get enough fissile material using either method. One was made for little boy and the other for fat man.</p>
<p>Fat man was shaped like a big round ball because it used the implosion  method which is best for plutonium. Basically a sphere of explosive charges were wrapped around the plutonium to start the fission reaction.</p>
<p>Little boy used the &quot;shot gun&quot; method where a golf size ball of uranium was fired into a basketball size ball of uranium to start the fission reaction. Little boy looked more like a torpedo because of this.</p>
<p>It's not like one method was particularly better than the other. In the long run though most nuclear weapons used plutonium because you could manufacture it from uranium 238 which is about 99% of the natural uranium you find. This is slightly easier than Filtering out the uranium 235 which makes up about 1% of the natural uranium you find.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
