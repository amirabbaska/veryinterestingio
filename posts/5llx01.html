		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>I'm wearing a pair of over-ear headphones. They have good sound isolation and I've quadruple checked that the sound is not coming from outside the headphones. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The headphones are connected to my 52&quot; LCD TV that's about 8 feet away. They are plugged into a head phone jack using a 6 foot 3.5mm jack male to female extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TV is on the &quot;PC channel&quot; (VGA input). The computer's volume is off. The TV's volume is at 0. In fact turning the TV volume up adds noise which hides this &quot;ghost station&quot; sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My physical position affects the quality of the signal.</p>
</li>
<li>The sound is extremely faint. Quieter than my heartbeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>ELI5, The sound is clearly people conversing and then what I can pick out to be music, what is happening?</p>
<p>Edit - it's definately music, so it's a radio station, I checked all the TV chanels (I don't have cable, I use an antenna)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple of my own theories.</p>
<p>1) the audio from another input on the TV is leaking onto the audio jack channel.</p>
<p>2) the cable is acting as an antenna and picking up a radio station (but what is the receiver?)</p>
<p>3) I'm acting as an antenna and picking up a radio station (how would my headphones pick that up, and where's the receiver?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A nearby AM radio station is being picked up and rectified by the TV. </p>
<p>A simple AM receiver can be made with a junction of two dissimilar metals or a metal needle point on a crystal. I suspect the electronics in the TV are performing the rectification and the headphone cable is the antenna. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pirate radio yyarrr! This is actually normal and happens with low quality speakers. Essentially the wire in your headphones are not shielded well so they are acting as an antenna. They are able to pick up a certain AM frequency because of this. I actually was able to once get legitimate pirate music (literally yo-ho ho and a bottle of rum type music) once from some old crappy speakers I had would wake me up at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere in the headphone circuit there's a cheap half-bridge rectifier. The headphone extension is also unshielded, allowing it to act as an antenna. The AM radio signal is its own power.</p>
<p>If the guilty circuit had used a <strong><em>FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER</em></strong> ^^cough ^^cough ^^sorry or if the cord was properly shielded, you wouldn't pick up the station.</p>
<p>Radio Shack used to sell (and may still sell) ferrite donuts called Chokes to snap over cables to eat parasitised RF signals.</p>
