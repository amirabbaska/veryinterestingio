		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a great post from someone back when it was going on; I'm trying to find it now.  I'd thought it was bestof'd, but apparently not.  I hope it wasn't deleted.</p>
<p>Anyway, according to that post (which seemed very well informed), it was <em>both</em> North Korea and a former employee.  There were multiple hacks and multiple releases.  The original hack was from a team in China, using a known exploit.  This team and this exploit had been used previously against anti-North Korea organizations in South Korea, so it's a pretty fair bet that they were working for NK to stop The Interview, like the media was saying.  But <em>then</em> there were more info releases.  They claimed to be from the same source, but they had different digital fingerprints.  Investigators believed that these were from a disgruntled employee trying to lash out at Sony, trying to hide their identity by pretending to be just another phase of the hack by North Korea.  The media, having zero understanding of tech stuff, glossed right over the difference between the two and jumped to &quot;was it Korea or was it not Korea?&quot;</p>
<p>Edit:  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2puo8h/bittorrent_offers_distribute_sonys_the_interview/cn0ksh7" target="_blank">Here is the post</a>.  Many thanks to /u/nationstate for finding it, and to /u/CSMastermind for writing it in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering some of the information leaked is extremely sensitive (Employee information, socials, movie plots, bank transfers, account numbers) I would bet quite a large amount of money that Sony did not do this as a PR stunt.   Also part of what was leaked was the fact that the new James Bond movie is more or less a glorified Mexican travel advertisement, the entire thing is bought by the Mexican Govt. to portray it in a positive light.  I would imagine that is not the type of information they want the world to be a ware of.   That said; they totally rode the shit out of the media it generated and rightfully so.  But no, they were not behind their own hack.  That ex disgruntled employee was; the FBI is an absolute joke of an investigative firm, a private IT company found the truth out. GO figure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
