		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not, the real answer is, 'we don't know'! The most common answer is that the jerking nature of running pulls on the ligaments tying the organs in our stomachs to our bones - but this can't be the whole answer, as people get stitches while swimming! </p>
<p>Another possibility is that as the heart rate increases, the blood pressure into the liver and spleen increases, making them bigger, squeezing some blood vessels partially closed. This causes some places to not get enough oxygen.</p>
<p>A third has to do with breathing. If a runner doesn't breathe deeply, part of their lungs don't get fresh air. As the blood is depleted in oxygen when it gets back to the lungs, the parts of the lungs with stale air in them aren't getting enough oxygen, and getting too much carbon dioxide, causing pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple theories.</p>
<p>The one I'm more comfortable with is lactic acid buildup. Basically there are two types of respiration, aerobic and anaerobic. Respiration is more or less the process by which we make energy. Aerobic means &quot;with air&quot; and anaerobic means &quot;without air&quot;. When we run, we use up all our oxygen, and to keep creating energy we have to use anaerobic respiration. There are two types of that, but the relevant one is lactic acid fermentation, wherein lactic acid is made as a byproduct of producing energy without oxygen. This acid is what winds up hurting.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the stitch is that the ligaments connected to your diaphragm strain when your diaphragm itself is strained, which happens when you run. Ligaments are connective tissues, and the diaphragm is the muscle that lets contracts and expands your lungs to let you breathe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stitch on your left side means you had too much water before you ran and your stomach cannot digest it because your blood is being pumped to your legs. </p>
<p>Stitch on your right side means you haven't had enough water and your liver is working overtime.</p>
<p>If a stitch happens on either side, slow down or walk, lean over and take 3 huge breathes. That forces fresh oxygen into your diaphragm which helps both the stomach &amp; liver work properly again.</p>
<p>30+ years of running and competition taught me many lessons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
