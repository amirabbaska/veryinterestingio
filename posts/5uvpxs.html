		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Americans call it the &quot;Philosopher's Stone&quot; too. It's just the title of the first Harry Potter book (and ultimately movie) was changed for the American market because they didn't think American kids would be familiar with alchemy and that they wouldn't want to read a book about philosophers. A number of British words and idioms were changed for the American market because American children wouldn't know, for example, what a crumpet was.</p>
<p>Remember that it was a book intended for children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Philosopher's Stone was the name given to the thing the alchemists were searching for.  When the first Harry Potter book (HP &amp; the Philosopher's Stone) was released in the US, the publisher decided to call it the HP &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone because they didn't think American children would be interested and/or knowledgeable about ancient alchemy.</p>
<p>It's not a common replacement - Americans still talk about the Philosopher's Stone when discussing alchemy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The American publisher of Harry Potter thought that not enough readers were familiar with the philosopher's stone, so they changed it to a more general term that clearly communicated the basic concept of &quot;magic rock&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
