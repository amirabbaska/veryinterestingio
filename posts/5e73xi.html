		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Happiness is subjective and influenced by a ton of different things, so it's hard to give a definitive answer.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of happiness as a good mood, that is something that can be taught. Only looking for the good things in life is kind of bullshit. If it's a quote you could find on Pinterest with an artsy font and over-exposed photo, process with caution. Everyone has bad days, things go wrong, no one's life is perfect. The difference between a spiraling bad mood and a good mood isn't in ignoring problems, it's in solving problems, looking at things realistically, being assertive, identifying unhelpful coping strategies, etc. Some people are very good at these skills, others need a bit more practice. But since they are <em>skills</em>, they can be learned and adopted.</p>
<p>Just a note that neurotransmitters are still not well understood. For example, with illnesses like depression and serotonin, people aren't actually sure if depression is caused by low serotonin levels or if low serotonin levels are an effect of depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Happiness is a hot topic in psychology at the moment and there isn't one standard theory with all the answers but there have been some studies that outline what makes people happy. </p>
<p>It is accepted that there different levels of happiness. For example, in studies extraverts are happier than introverts on a day to day basis. This doesn't mean introverts live worst lives because there are more important things at play. The other personality trait is neuroticism which means a person's likeliness to have negative thoughts. If a person is neurotic they are likely to be less happy than average but again this is kind of on shallow level. </p>
<p>It is one thing to be happy and cheery but it is another to live a fulfilling life. For example you get plenty of introverted people that have meaningful lives. The building blocks for having a this kind of lifestyle can range from having a deep sense of purpose, having freedom to live your own life and having some kind of expertise/skill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your personality is built around the way you use your brain. </p>
<p>Think of your brain as several paths in the grass that lead to different feelings and logic types. </p>
<p>You start as a new born with all paths  (neuropathways) open and easy to walk on. At about 2 ,based on interactions, your brain let's some unused pathways grow over and become unusable.  Again at about 8 and then again at about 13. </p>
<p>This is the basis of how you deal with things as an adult. Your brain automatically takes the most used paths.  You can however take the paths that are still there and find a different route to positivity for instance it just takes a little bit of work at first.  But the more you use the path the better worn it gets until your brain sees that as the easy path. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More and more is being learned about the brain all the time. There are 4 primary chemicals that do all sorts of things like manage mood and happiness which are Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin, and Endorphins. Different activities and drugs can tell your brain to release these but different brains release different amounts all the time. Things like exercise, sex, and drinking plenty of water can tell your brain to fire away. With in the recent history studies have also started showing that gut bacteria can have a play in brain function and mood too. So eating right and making sure to maintain healthy gut flora is important.  </p>
<p>To more directly answer your question, having the right amount of brain chemicals (and possibly gut bacteria) can be a huge part of why naturally happy people are happy all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My honest opinion is no one is &quot;naturally&quot; happier, happiness is a choice. Those who are happier did not come upon it naturally, it simply means they pursued it. Some passively pursue happiness without knowing it. It's passively assimilated into their lifestyle (this only gets you so far, sudden changes can ruin these people's happiness). Others may have to choose to digress from their present thought process and actions to find it. The main advice I can give if you are the latter (which I can only assume) is to be aware of how much of what you know would make you happy is obscured by fear or disbelief. Push your boundaries, but ideally within your own being and experience, don't always reach or rely on others for their versions of happiness, because it may not be right for you and they won't always be there. Who knows, you could find yourself being the next &quot;naturally&quot; happier person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
