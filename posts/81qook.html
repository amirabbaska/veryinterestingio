<p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/4811197/nasa-astronaut-scott-tingle-tweets-beautiful-picture-of-red-romaine-lettuce-being-grown-on-the-iss/" target="_blank">https://www.inquisitr.com/4811197/nasa-astronaut-scott-tingle-tweets-beautiful-picture-of-red-romaine-lettuce-being-grown-on-the-iss/</a></p>
<p>They use a combination of colored LEDs to grow them, but I was wondering why they couldn't create a sort of greenhouse with glass windows in the ISS that allows natural sunlight to come in while having a system maintain the proper air quality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for all the in-depth responses. It seems like there are several different reasons which factor into why using LEDs is better.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Day/night cycle: Apparently because of the rapid orbit of the ISS, it experiences 45 minute &quot;daytimes&quot; and 45 minute &quot;nighttimes&quot; (That's 16 ISS days to 1 earth day for those wondering). As plants on earth are used to the normal day/night cycle, this would affect their growth (and most likely make them unable to thrive). Thanks /u/Valmyr5!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost: As pointed out, the cost of space-proof glass is exorbitant compared to the cost of the LED bulbs that we use to light up our hallways at night to prevent from tripping over Legos and the sort.</p>
</li>
<li>Heat: Allowing the sun to enter a greenhouse type of area on board a spacecraft would cause extreme fluctuations in temperature, and so that would create a need for more infrastructure for the project like heat pumps and radiative fins.</li>
</ol>
<p>There were many other reasons stated, but these were the ones that seemed to answer my question most directly. Alas, it seems the sun has set on my hope for space jungles... </p></div></div>

Since they've got other concerns, it's much easier to recreate the light source than it is to constantly maneuver the ship so to have direct sunlight for 14 hours a day. You'd also need a clear bulkhead to allow the light in. </p>
<p>It's just easier to balance all of the needs on the ISS with artificial light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants don't use the whole spectrum of light (all the colors) needing mostly red and some blue. Some plants also control their stages with a photoperiod (the amount of time light hits the plant a day) which changes with earth's seasons.</p>
<p>Letting in sunlight is problematic on the ISS because windows in space are difficult and costly and also the ISS orbits the earth every 90mins (half the time in the dark and half in light).</p>
<p>On the other hand you could just grow the plant anywhere inside the ISS and use led lights instead of the sun. They are very energy efficient (low power draw and only use the colors of light you need) and produce very little heat.</p>
<p>Tl;dr - it's cheaper and less complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'd get 45 minute days and 45 minute nights in orbit at ISS altitude. Plants are not adapted for such short cycles.</p>
<p>Infrared and UV are problems outside the atmosphere, but fixable. A gold lined polycarbonate window could block both IR and UV, like the visors on astronaut helmets.</p>
<p>Heating/cooling is a problem for a greenhouse in orbit. The light side heats up to 250 C, the dark side cools down to minus 250 C. You need heat pumps to equilibrate temperature and radiative fins for passive cooling.</p>
<p>You need closed circuit atmosphere control within, to keep gas balance and humidity within appropriate limits.</p>
<p>Most of these problems are solvable, but the 45 minute light cycle is not. Therefore you need artificial lighting.</p>
<p>This is only an orbital problem. If you're not in orbit (like on a trip to Mars), you could tow a greenhouse behind your ship and just give it a slow spin to give it 12 hour days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/PrionBacon covered the biology side of it, so I'll throw in some context from an engineering perspective of why constructing a greenhouse in space isn't such a simple task.</p>
<p>Heat is a major concern. Look at the cupola, for instance, which has the largest windows on the ISS. From Robert Frost, an engineer with NASA,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nominally, the shutters for the Cupola windows are closed.  They are open when the windows are to be used.  We don't like to keep the shutters open for three reasons:</p>
<p>1) micrometeor impact risk</p>
<p>2) overheating concerns</p>
<p>3) contamination of the windows from off-gassing visiting vehicles and thruster plumes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-windows-in-the-ISS-Cupola-got-over-heated" target="_blank">this</a> page.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the overheating concern isn't just for the window pane, it's for the equipment inside the module as well. Direct sunlight in space is tricky because the heat from it doesn't like to naturally dissipate, and it isn't diffused by atmosphere, which would probably damage the plants, as others have said. In other words, &quot;natural light&quot; on Earth isn't the same as &quot;natural light&quot; in space. So there are a few reasons why windows are a difficult engineering task to overcome. The windows on the cupola actually have RTDs on them that monitor the temp of the window. It the temp exceeds flight rule limits, the shutters have to be closed. Basically whenever the windows aren't actively being used the shutters are closed.</p>
<p>Edit: Syntax and stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of problems with using direct sunlight on a spacecraft:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows are a structural weak point on a spacecraft, and having enough windows to run a greenhouse would put the craft at risk of explosive decompression. Also, controlling temperature is extremely difficult, and windows would add to that complexity by allowing the craft to absorb heat in an uncontrolled manner (heat is actually really hard to get rid of in space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earth's atmosphere filters out UV-C radiation, which would burn plants (as well as anything else living)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A low orbit around a planet creates a very short day-night cycle, and a high orbit creates <em>no</em> day-light cycle, meaning that a complex set of shades would be needed to accommodate the plants' need for something close to a 24-hour cycle (people have suggested rotating the craft to simulate a day-night cycle, but that would make docking with it rather nightmarish and would create problems for solar panels.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Space is at a premium in spacecraft, and using windows to provide sunlight require not only the space for the plants but also clear line of sight from the windows to the planters, which means you can't use that space for storage or other plants.</p>
</li>
<li>If you want to have separate day cycles for different plants (for example bringing some plants to maturity by simulating a &quot;winter&quot; photoperiod while letting others &quot;summer&quot; and grow), you would need to have either a separate greenhouse for each cycle or else a bulky and complex set of shades inside the spacecraft.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these problems can be overcome, but there simply isn't anything other than aesthetics to recommend natural sunlight over artificial light, so until reaching orbit becomes easy enough that we can start prioritizing aesthetics over functionality, it makes more sense to go with the artificial option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
