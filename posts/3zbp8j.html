		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually an area of heated debate right now. Short answer: we're not sure. There's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_theory_of_olfaction" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration_theory_of_olfaction" target="_blank">competing</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odotope_theory" target="_blank">models</a> (with varying degrees of support) for how exactly molecular recognition for smell works. Our understanding of how much the &quot;smell space&quot; can be reduced and quantized will be influenced heavily by which of these models most closely reflects reality. </p>
<p>A paper from 2014 claimed that we could distinguish upwards of a trillion smells. This was refuted last year, with a paper claiming the original one was flawed. It's hard to know at this point if we might reduce the &quot;smell space&quot; to a small subset of base smells or not, there just isn't clear enough data yet. </p>
<p>One important point is that our genome has about <del>10</del> 3% of our genes devoted to smell receptors - about <del>3000</del> 1000 genes. At least 400 of these are functional. This means that there are at least 400 different permutations of responses that could happen, and <a href="http://superhelical.com/2015/11/30/how-spicy-would-you-like-that-chemotherapy/" target="_blank">different receptors could react to different molecules in different ways</a>, so the complexity is already huge. Combine multiple receptors simultaneously, it gets even more complex. </p>
<p>At the same time, that could be a lot of overkill and we might only use a subset of those receptors well, and there might be a much greatly reduced pool of &quot;dimensions of odour space&quot;. </p>
<p>In short, we're not sure, it's a bit of a tangled mess, but we'll know a lot more in a few years. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Whoops, remembered incorrectly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_receptor" target="_blank">there are ~1000 receptors, not 3000</a>. But the point still stands. We've got a lot of receptors, and it's hard to make sense of them at this point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you regarding naturally occurring flavor chemicals that mimic other food types. Are they the same? For example, there's an aromatic compound in an ethiopian coffee cultivar that tastes exactly like blueberry, and there's also a terpene in a marijuana strain that smells like blueberry. Are these the exact same chemical found in a ripe blueberry?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>10 years ago or so I was reading about smell generators that were supposed to work this way, you could hook it up to your computer and send people scents in an email, or have game support to smell burning rubber in a racing game. The article was totally convincing and I was under the impression they'd be on the market within the next couple years but it never happened so obviously something went horribly awry with the concept</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At our local science centre, there was a display where they presented an artificial scent in full, and for comparison, the scent with a single chemical component missing.  It became a vastly different odour.  A simple &quot;RGB-Style&quot; mapping may not be possible.  A single simple chemical can affect multiple taste/smell sensor cells in different ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
