		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't say much for ESSA, but I would like to outline a key part of NCLB:</p>
<p>The federal Department of Education gives a large amount of funding to the education departments of each state. NCLB was a set of laws that said states had to abide by new conditions to receive that funding. Some of those conditions looked like good ideas on the surface, but under scrutiny were very bad.</p>
<p>For example, NCLB said that certain student test scores needed to improve every year. So, if 50% of 3rd graders passed their reading test in one year, NCLB said that 60% needed to pass the next year, then 70%, etc. On the surface, this seems mostly OK -- let schools gradually get better.</p>
<p>The problem is that the final goals for the NCLB, after a decade or so, were 100% of students passing every test. Not 99.9%. Not all students but one or two. A law actually stated that literally every student needed to pass their tests, or the state wouldn't get funding. Of course, that's COMPLETELY ridiculous. It was ridiculous before the law was signed. There was never a point at which this was a sensible approach.</p>
<p>For the first couple years, states were mostly able to meet the cut off passing rates. Eventually, the required passing rates became impossible to meet.</p>
<p>What happens then? Well, it turns out that so many states couldn't meet the passing rates, that the federal Department of Education had to develop a complex waiver system. The states could come to the feds and say &quot;we can't meet the standard this year&quot;, and the feds said &quot;OK, but you have to jump through these other policy hoops&quot;.</p>
<p>At least one of the major policy hoops was also absolutely ridiculous:</p>
<p>The feds said all states seeking waivers were required to use student scores on standardized tests to evaluate all teachers. That is, if you were a teacher, and the kids in your class didn't get better test scores than they did the previous year (or didn't improve enough), you would be given a lower evaluation. This lower evaluation would go in your permanent record as a teacher, and would affect your opportunities for advancement, extra bonuses or stipends, and things like that.</p>
<p>It seems like a good idea to hold teachers accountable. It seems like if you put some pressure on teachers, they would teach better. So it looks good on the surface.</p>
<p>In reality, student test scores are influenced by many, many other things. If emergency vehicles are driving by the window with their sirens on, if the A/C in the building isn't working right, if the kid doesn't have food at home, if the parents keep the kid up till 11pm every night watching TV, etc. If you think those problems aren't real or common, know that basically <strong>half of all kids in the country get free or reduced price lunch right now.</strong> No matter what life you're envisioning for average kids today, you need to ratchet it down in luxuriousness several clicks, because things are very different than they were even ten years ago.</p>
<p>The idea of evaluating teachers based on student test scores is so bad that the American Statistical Association wrote an <a href="http://www.amstat.org/policy/pdfs/asa_vam_statement.pdf" target="_blank">official statement</a> in 2014 that says things like &quot;[value added metrics]  do not directly measure potential teacher contributions toward other student outcomes&quot; and &quot;Most VAM studies find that teachers account for about 1% to 14% of the variability in test scores&quot;.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>tl;dr: NCLB required states to achieve literally impossible goals in order to get funding. When the states couldn't achieve those goals, the federal Department of Education required states to implement systems that have been proven to be broken, to get a &quot;waiver&quot; and continue receiving funding.</strong></p>
<p>And that's literally only two parts of the whole puzzle. Everyone who has gone through school thinks they could run a school. Education is a much deeper field than most people realize...and you have to sacrifice your earning potential for your entire life if you want to work on it. It's a mess, but some of us are trying to move it forward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The bipartisan bill was signed by Obama this morning to remove a lot of the bad parts of the No Child Left Behind Act (like evaluating teachers based on the test scores of their students) and puts more of the work of evaluating schools on local/ state governments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ESSA seems to be the replacement for the federal governments stance on education and requirements of No Child Left Behind. Basically it is NCLB with some of the teeth removed which puts more power over the implementation of educational goals and standards, still set at the federal level, into the hands of the states. This allows the states to decide on how to intervene in the education of students who are falling below the &quot;college and career ready&quot; standards that are still maintained in this new bill after being carried over from NCLB. Common Core will still be around but it seems that they will not be coercing the states to adopt the standards. The ESSA also sets aside 250million in funding for preschool education, which is addressed and recognized by this bill as being an important part of education. </p>
<p>A lot of the problems with NCLB were taken care of through a state by state waiver system that was put in place by the Obama Administration to loosen/remove certain requirements on the states that had become problematic. The ESSA ceases the necessity for the waivers and makes them national in a sense, and is being touted as a major bipartisan success for 2015.</p>
<p>Edit: changed &quot;stance on&quot; to &quot;stance on education&quot;</p>
<p>Edit2: I believe also that teachers will no longer be evaluated on the standardized test scores of their students. Basically it looks like ESSA resets everything back to square one, ridding us of an ineffective NCLB while simultaneously leaving us right where we were with NCLB and the need for reform both before and after its inception.</p>
<p>Edit3: TL;DR--- ESSA is a tiny bit better. It replaces what we had (NCLB) with something a little closer to what we had before NCLB became law. States have more control over education under the new law than under NCLB. We still have many of the same problems.
