		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost 70 years ago, China had a really big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War" target="_blank">civil war</a> between the Commies and the Nationalists. After several years of hard fighting the commies kicked the Nationalist out of China and to Taiwan. The Nationalists on the island still said they were actually China and the Commies were just lawless rebels who just happened to occupy all of China except the island. </p>
<p>Since this was at the start of the Cold War and the Nationalists were Not-Commies, the US supported Taiwan in the United Nations, officially claiming there were the legitimate government of China, the Commies obviously said &quot;you serious? we own like everything&quot; and the Soviets backed them. So we backed Taiwan and gave them lots of guns and money. This continued for a couple decades.</p>
<p>Then in the 70's things changed. The Soviets and the Chinese Commies stopped being friends and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict" target="_blank">even shot at each other a few times</a>. At the same time Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger were in charge of the US and they had a policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik" target="_blank">&quot;lets be realistic with who we make friends with so we can make the Soviets have less friends&quot;</a>. Since China and the Soviets weren't on good terms we rolled in and said &quot;hey China, we'll be pals with you, and have trade, with lots of money!&quot; The Commies said &quot;sure, but what about that rebel island?&quot; The US couldn't just said &quot;screw you Taiwan&quot; since they were good friends, but we didn't want to make the Commies not be friends, so we said &quot;okay, we'll say the Commies are China and stop saying Taiwan is China, then we'll kept selling Taiwan weapons while we trade with China.&quot; The Commies were...kind of okay with this, they still have the rebel island out there that still claims its technically the real government of China, but now they have a huge market to export good to, and since the US agreed to pretend that Taiwan isn't a real government, they can officially say &quot;We are China&quot;. </p>
<p>The problem is, since Taiwan has been separate for so long, a lot of people in Taiwan think they're less China and more just Taiwan, so now people are considering just making the island independent. China can't allow that since its technically/legally still just a rebel island they haven't gotten around to pacifying yet. So if the US were to treat Taiwan like it was the government of China or its own nation, it would give them legitimacy, which goes against what we promised the Commies we'd do way back when.   </p>
<p><em>Edit</em> I've edited out a small line in the beginning to make the explanation a tiny bit more clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US agreed to adopt a &quot;One China&quot; policy (where Taiwan is not a country, but part of China).  The Taiwanese are not on board with that, preferring to govern themselves and be their own country.  In general, the US doesn't have official diplomatic discussions directly with the Taiwanese government.</p>
<p>The President of Taiwan knows this, and Trump knows this, and they had a direct call anyway.  For Taiwan, it's poking the Chinese by pretending to be independent.  For Trump, it's warning the Chinese that he might do any old random thing (like formally recognizing Taiwan) to get even with them if future negotiations don't go his way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, since no one is really getting at the heart of the issue, this relates back to the concepts of International Norms, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia" target="_blank">Treaty of Westphalia</a>. Essentially, to terribly simplify, in 1648 a treaty was signed that is the basis of the current international system. Our entire world order is more or less built upon the ideas agreed upon in this document, to the point where political theorists classify the world order as &quot;Westphalian&quot;. There is a lot of stuff in this treaty, but the key thing you need to know is that it spells out what is, and is not, a state. A state is defined as a political entity in control of a geographic space and people for the purposes of this discussion. Essentially, they, and now every government worth anything today, said that a country is a state if:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has defined borders.</li>
<li>It has a permanent population.</li>
<li>It can engage in trade with other states.</li>
<li>It is recognized by other states.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we get to Taiwan, it is vital to realize the world <em>only works the way it does because we all agree to play by a made up set of rules</em>. We have stability because we all agree to act according to a set of rules for which there is no immediate penalty for deviation. </p>
<p>Now, Taiwan. Until the 1970s, Taiwan, known as the Republic of China, was the only governmental entity, and thus the only state, of the Chinese people. Without deep diving into modern Chinese history, what you should know is that Taiwan is basically the Chinese who fled the revolution in 1949, and established a government in exile. It has become less and less government in exile as it became clear the PRC isn't going anywhere. From 1949, until the mid-late 70s, the entirety of mainland China did not exist in an international relations context, for much of the world. The UN seat and Security Council Permanent Seat were held by the RoC, with roughly a billion people on the mainland having no representation. The PRC failed the 4th and final piece of the definition, which is to be recognized by other states. The Soviets worked with them, and other Marxist regimes, but it was not a widespread thing. This changed with the opening of China under Nixon. </p>
<p>When Mao and Nixon made nice, this began a process of China proper re-entering the international sphere. The state itself was recognized, and the UN seats were taken from Taiwan and given to the PRC, as the actual Chinese state, instead of some rump government in exile. Basically, 1 billion trumps a few million. You can debate the merits of this all day, but this is how it is. </p>
<p>So, since the 70s, the world order is as follows. The PRC is China, and the only China. Taiwan is a pseudo autonomous renegade province, who's citizens are technically considered citizens of the PRC by every group on earth, including the US. Sure, we sell them weapons, and talk to them, but never officially. Essentially, it's don't ask, don't tell with the island. We don't push the issue, the Chinese don't push their side. Imperfect to be sure, but that's the best we've got. So, why do we not talk to Taiwan? Simple, <em>it is not a state, and thus cannot have diplomatic relations with other states. To have an elected official call in any sort of capacity, is to de facto acknowledge that the state exists, otherwise you could not talk to them</em>. For example, US diplomats are forbidden from even saying hello to their counterparts from Iran, Cuba, and North Korea, even if they are stuck next to them in a crowd. We do not have relations with those states, and thus do not speak to them in any capacity. Now, obviously, we talk to Taiwan, but never officially, and anything the President does is official. </p>
<p>So, why is talking to them a serious issue if you happen to be the POTUS elect? Because it sends the message that the US, as an entity, is willing to disregard the fundamental norms that we all operate under. It's sort of like playing a pickup game of basketball, and refusing to dribble down the court. There are zero actual immediate consequences of that action (you can't be ejected, or punished in any real way), however, the people you are playing with will be livid. The game only works if you play by the rules. They may refuse to play with you next time, or if you happen to own the only ball, or perhaps the court is at your house, simply start breaking the rules when it suits them. So, yes, a phone call seems minor, but what it opens up is a whole nasty can of worms that could be very, very, un-minor. </p>
<p>tl;dr- We have made up rules that keep things stable. Calling Taiwan breaks those rules because Taiwan doesn't really exist in the right way. Breaking the made up rules, means that the US might break other made up rules, leading to everyone else breaking the rules too, leading to a very unstable chaotic world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Chinese Civil War didn't actually end in 1950. One side (ROC) just moved to Taiwan, while the other side (PRC) stayed in the rest of China. They don't agree on a lot, but they do agree there is only one China. The ROC says the government of China is in Taiwan, while the PRC says the government of China is in Beijing. For a long time, the U.S. agreed with the ROC that the government of China was in Taiwan, but in order to trade with the PRC and to have international cooperation, they eventually changed their position. The PRC and the U.S. reached an agreement that says there is one China and the U.S. agrees that its government is in Beijing. </p>
<p>There are some people who live in Taiwan who don't think Taiwan should be the ROC, but should be an independent Taiwan. The U.S. says that it will not allow either the PRC or ROC to unify China through war.  The PRC has said if Taiwan declares independence, it will use war to re-unite China. They are ok with the ROC existing on its own (for now) as long as they don't declare independence. </p>
<p>Trump taking a phone call with the President of Taiwan makes them fear that the U.S. will support Taiwan independence. Or that encouragement from the President of the U.S. will encourage them to move towards independence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, Taiwan and China got beef. The US kinda got beef with China, but it ain't like all that. So Taiwan needs guns to beef with China. And we sell guns. So we mighta sold Taiwan that new piece they pulled the other day. It's cool though, cause it couldn't have been the US, cause we don't know that nigga Taiwan, right...? You know Tai? And where his guns are coming from? </p>
<p>Now, China ain't dumb. They know full well we know Taiwan and that we run guns. But it's cool, long as we don't know nobody named Taiwan. However, Taiwan wants to let the whole hood know that not only do he got a new piece, but that he's rolling deep with the hardest dudes in the hood. So they're all like &quot;Hey China, this is homie I told you about. What's really good?&quot; Now, China knows we're some Gs and doesn't want that noise, but they gotta maintain their street cred and flex their gangsta. </p>
<p>Basically we damaged China's street cred in addition to moving guns to dudes they be beefing with. Moving the guns was one thing, but bragging about it on public is too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
