		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All human's, aside from identical twins, have a different mix of unique markers that allow for the recognition of self and nonself. The most important is the Major Histocompatibility Complex or MHC. Nearly every cell in your body expresses MHC which is loaded with a little bit of protein called a peptide. These peptides can come from self and from pathogens. An individual's T cells are designed to react to cells that express an MHC that binds unusually strongly. During T cell development, T cells selected that they won't bind self MHC with self peptide. Foreign tissue like transplanted organs express MHC that your T cells will bind strongly which causes the T cell to kill the foreign tissue through activation of cytotoxic T cells which punch holes in the transplanted organ and macrophages that will eat it.</p>
<p>Our organs never evolved survival mechanisms to evade the immune systems whereas many parasites have. The type of immune response I described above is what is called a Th1 or cell mediate response. Th2 and humoral responses are used against parasites. Because parasites are so large, our body is more focused on controlling it than killing it which could damage the infected tissue. Your body does produced antibodies against the parasite that can cover it which leads to cells like eosinophils degranulating toxins on the parasite but because parasites have many life stages it is often difficult to mount an antibody response against multiple forms of the parasite.</p>
<p>TLDR: Transplanted organs are an easy target that doesn't try to protect itself while your body doesn't want to cause damage by destroying parasites</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every cell in our body has a molecule called MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex class-I) expressed on it. In the steady state, proteins from within the cell are broken into peptides (small fragments of proteins) and these peptides are loaded onto MHC-I and exported to the cell surface. This gives an antigenic barcode if you will, of all the peptides within a cell, and therefore an organ (and whole body). Our immune system remains in a tolerogenic state to &quot;self antigens&quot; but will however recognise &quot;foreign, or non-self&quot; antigens displayed on MHC-I, such as those from a foreign organ.</p>
<p>Removal of MHC-I from the surface of an organ won't allow the organ to be ignored because cells called natural killer (NK cells) recognise the absence of MHC and will destroy the cells.</p>
<p>Worms avoid detection by 3 main mechanisms. Firstly, some worms have a sheath that they will shed upon entry into the host. The sheath will contain the major antigens that would otherwise facilitate recognition. Without this sheath, the worm can go into stealth mode. Now that it is in stealth mode, the worm can burrow into the linings of the GI tract. This causes lots of damage and the natural reaction for the body is to form a granuloma. Granuloma formation effectively blocks the immune system from effectively getting access to the worm and having a go at destroying it. Think about trying to kill a giant within a fortified castle - similar case here. Thirdly, worms have a specific lifecycle. The antigens expressed on the eggs, larvae and adult worms can all be different and so the immune system is trying to hit a moving target.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised to not see a more detailed answer to this so far, so here goes:
Both parasites (and cancer cells) exploit systems your body has in place to turn off the immune system. For every time you mount and immune attack, there are counteracting pathways that try to turn off that attack so you don't harm anything that isn't supposed to be harmed. In general, this proceeds through regulatory T cells coming in and suppressing the immune response. Both worms and cancers turn on regulatory T cells to tune down the immune system. Here is a review: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17534075" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17534075</a>
Organs do not have this capability, because they didn't have a need to defend from the immune system where they were growing. They also possess antigens on their surface (like worms and cancer) that the immune system wants to destroy. If we strip these antigens off, you can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
