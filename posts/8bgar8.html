		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The court would ordinarily provide the defendant with a payment plan, potentially combined with other avenues such as wage garnishment or a writ of execution (ordering that some of the defendant’s assets be sold and the proceeds given to the plaintiff).</p>
<p>However, the court can’t wring blood from a stone. If the money simply doesn’t exist, then it doesn’t exist. The term for a defendant who doesn’t have the resources to pay a legal judgment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_proof?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">judgment proof</a>. Many lawyers working on contingency won’t agree to take a case where the only potential defendant is judgment proof. It’s a lot of work for nothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a solicitor in the UK and this is one of the main considerations we have when advising a client whether to undertake litigation or not. </p>
<p>If the defendant does not have the funds to meet a judgment, then there is little point in litigating.</p>
<p>Interesting note, a defendant may apply to the court for an interim order for security for costs. This is done early in the process (before trial) and is essentially a defendant convincing a judge that there is a risk that the claimant cannot meet the defendant's costs if the defendant wins. </p>
<p>As the defendant usually has no choice but to defend a claim, the court may order the claimant to pay a sum into the court as security in the event that they are ordered to meet some/all of the defendants costs.</p>
<p>Side note: you almost never recover all your costs in an English court. 2/3rds is the usual amount. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
