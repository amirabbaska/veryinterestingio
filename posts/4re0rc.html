		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is, indeed, scientific. The pH scale, you could say, is a simplified 1-14 scale of something a bit more complex. (For people who know about Logs, it involves that - pH means -logH, where H is Hydrogen). So what pH is basically telling you is how many positive Hydrogen ions you have in your substance (an ion being an atom which as gained or lost electrons. Positive means it has lost an electron). The two 'sides' of the scales represesent two things: For numbers less than 7, your thing is acidic. For numbers greater than 7, it is basic. The scale tells us about the balance between 'acidic' ions (H+) and 'basic' ones (OH-). If the number of each of these is equal to one another, then you will have a pH of 7, neutral pH.</p>
<p>Sorry for lack of cohesion, it's after 11pm and I'm tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's objective. pH is all about the fact that water molecules (H2O) sometimes separate into charged fragments known as ions: H+ and OH-. A neutral pH (such as is found in pure water) is the level at which the number of these two types of ions is equal. Adding other substances can skew the balance to Acidic (more H+) or Alkaline (more OH-).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two Hydrogen and the Oxygen atoms of the water molecule usually live together pretty well, but sometimes they have fights and break up in H^+ and OH^- (the oxygen takes one electron from the hydrogen because he is bigger stronger and evil, so there are these electrical charges). This is very rare and you'll only around a billionth of the water molecules do that, but this is important because the H^+ and OH^- may interact with other compounds and are responsible for the acid/basic properties.</p>
<p>Some other molecules also have these fights when they are with water, for example, HCl breaks in H^+ and Cl^- and NaOH breaks in Na^+ and OH^-, then you will have more H^+ than OH^- if there's HCl added to water or more OH^- than H^+. In some substances the atoms simply can't stand one another and all of the molecules break apart so the changes are very significant.</p>
<p>Pure water is neutral, witch means there are as much H^+ as OH^- , but if you throw an acid(substances which release H^+ ) there will be more H^+ so the PH will be acid, and if you throw a base(substances witch release OH^- ) there will be more OH^- so the PH will be basic/alkaline.</p>
<p>Some non-EL5 math: the PH is defined from the molar concentration of the H^+ ion. Since the concentration is so small it would often be written as a potency of 10, like 10^-7, but taking only the 7 from the expression is more readable, so the PH means taking only the opposite of the exponent. For reasons concerning the chemical equilibrium of the water the product of the concentration of H^+ and OH^- is 10^-14 (at 25ÂºC), witch means if there's the same amount of the ions, both will have a concentration of 10^-7 witch is why the neutral PH is 7.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The water and some other molecules have fights and break apart, and the parts of these divisions are responsible for the acid/basic properties.</p>
<p>EDIT: I wrote hydrogen as hidrogen, just fixed it. Sorry for my Engrisch</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has said it yet, but I think it is worth mentioning that pH is in a logarithm scale, so you should be aware of it when you compare two values:</p>
<p>Something with pH 6 in comparison to 7 has 10 times more of the H+ ion in the solution. If you go to 5, you will have 100 times more of H+ in the solution! So just keep that in mind when comparing values...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll just chip in with something not discussed here. There are some products - <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/90/f6/ef/90f6eff21ce9e970506d79cab275f1e5.jpg" target="_blank">mainly skin creams and such</a> - which claim to have &quot;neutral pH&quot;.</p>
<p>This is simply a marketing term and has no connection to the scientific and objective neutral pH that the fellow redditors talk about here (7).</p>
<p>This marketing term simply states that the product's pH is close enough to human skin's pH and coined it &quot;neutral&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
