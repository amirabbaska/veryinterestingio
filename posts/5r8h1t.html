		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to keep balance you want the system measuring it somewhere that experiences the least acceleration during normal movement and that is the head. The position in the ear is useful, too, as it is further and on opposite sides from the center of the head and therefore experience more movement and in opposite directions when you turn your head which improves signal strength. If it were near you nose it would be more or less just measuring in one spot while the ears are far apart so you have two points for measuring.</p>
<p>It also needs to be close to the eyes as it causes/controls eye movement to compensate head movement so that the image you see is stabilized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to a lot of answers about why the head in general, the ears make the most natural location when you think about evolution.  Almost all animals have an extremely acute sense of hearing.  Even humans can use the millisecond discrepancy between ears for locating the source of a noise.  Because ears are used for a sort of echolocation (not the way bats do), they are a good organ to have the parts for balance.  Hearing uses an extremely delicate form of sensory perception, unlike sight or smell which is fairly basic or analog if you understand them.  Detecting subtle changes in pitch, frequency, and amplitude require high precision, and so does balance.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that we are bilateral organisms is important.  Having two senses of balance as far away from each other as possible improves balance and ensures that there isn't a local problem interfering.  If the balancing mechanics were in the eyes, for example, each would be very susceptible to anything affecting the other since the two sides are so close.</p>
<p>Edit: It seems that balance developed before hearing so my first paragraph would be the reverse, though I'm going to leave the paragraph there because it does show a nice correlation between hearing and balance.  The second part of my answer seems to be a better one, since the ear evolved from the lateral-line on fish that detected pressure changes in water.  They had one on both sides to increase stability.  Since fish are horizontally directed they required it along their whole body, where as we only need it in the control center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers explain why the ears are a good location for it.</p>
<p>But its very wrong to think of evolution as perfect. Its wrong to think every thing is in the right place and theres a reason &quot;why&quot;.</p>
<p>Evolution is iterative and not designed or engineered. The fact the balance organ is in our ear is at least largely due to pure chance. The organisms that developed a sense of balance happened to develop it in a certain place and as that species evolved that structure is where our ears are now, possibly because thats evolutionarily advantageous, possibly just cause shit happens, possibly a bit of both.</p>
<p>Not everything in your body can be explained as &quot;well thats like that and located there because it gave a greater chance of survival or because it made us better&quot;. Thats not how evolution works. Natural selection drives evolution in a certain way, but it cannot plan ahead, so when the sense of balance developed no creature sat and thought &quot;right well where should i put this, thats a good spot&quot; it developed wherever it mutated and possibly moved over many generations due to natural selection. </p>
<p>Maybe its not &quot;finished&quot; either. Evolution is iterative. Humans and other animals are quite easily made dizzy and put off balance, ear infections are suscetible to affecting our sense of balance. We're actually kinda shit. Who says our sense of balance is perfected. Its obviously not.</p>
<p>A god example of evolution that has led to a stupid part of our body is our laryngeal nerve. The nerve that connects our brain to our larynx (voice box) goes down into our chest, loops around a major artery then back up to our throat. It takes a stupid fucking detour and thats cause shit was iterated from an earlier being, it had not plan or design that could point out it makes no sense.</p>
<p>The laryngeal nerve still loops around the heart in giraffes. Even with the length of their neck, evolution couldnt just redesign the nerve structure for convenience or good design, the nerve goes all the way down that neck and all the way back up</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because hearing and equilibrium are fundamentally the same sort of sense in vertebrates. Both are senses that detect acceleration. In fact, it might be better to say that our ears are located in our equilibrium organs, since there's a decent chance the  equilibrium organs came first.  The thing to realize is that equilibrium organs in the &quot;ear&quot; region go waaay back.  The very first vertebrates had them.  In primitive fish hearing and orientation are accomplished in the same way.  You've got a small &quot;bone&quot; (an otolith) located in a sac lined with cilia. There's also a tube or two lined with cilia.  As the fish moves, the heavy otolith falls to a different side of the sac, always resting on the lowest side.  The cilia &quot;feel&quot; where it is.  This lets the fish know which way is down.  A sudden twist of the head generates a current in the canal (try holding a glass of water and twisting it, and note how the water stays still as the glass moves past, now imagine tiny hairs on the inside of the glass detecting this relative motion). Likewise, hearing occurs when sound waves travel through the fish, accelerating the ear back and forth and causing the otolith to bounce around inside the sac.  That's detected as sound.  </p>
<p>Now, both hearing and orientation have gone on to become more complicated in humans.  But they are both basically refinements of the same system and so they remain in the same place.</p>
<p>As for why both systems are in the head, there's a tendency called &quot;cephalization&quot; which is apparent in many animals and certainly in early vertebrates.  It makes sense to cram the sense organs near the brain, because this lets them send signals to the brain more rapidly.  When a fraction of a second makes a difference in, eg, being eaten, you want to minimize ping time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, i dont know exactly, but it has to do with your balance/eyes. </p>
<p>Did you ever notice, that, if you tilt your head the image you see is still somewhat leveled? Thats because your equilibrium aligne with your eyes. If they where in your feet, your brain wouldn't know if your head is tilted and could not correct the image in your head. </p>
<p>Also it balances you as your head is the highest point of your body, think of it as a water level on your head to keep you from falling to one side or the other. It also works like the water level.</p>
