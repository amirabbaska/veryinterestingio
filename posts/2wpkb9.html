		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hah. No one here gets it. When babies are very small, their brains are basically supercomputers, picking up all the information available and discriminating/discerning what's important/what's not. Why we frequently talk to babies in 'motherese' (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_talk" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_talk</a>), is for a few different reasons, but here's my best approximation of it: the baby's mind is trying it's best to figure out what phonetic sounds are most common in the language it's being spoken to in, so it can start to discriminate and pay more attention to those sounds and start to apply signification/meaning to them. We elongate &amp; enunciate these sounds for babies (and it's the same in every language) to make it easier for their little sponge-brains to figure out what sounds they should be paying attention to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Linguist here.) There's a concept called phonetic symbolism where it turns out that the particular sounds we use in language may not be totally arbitrary. There's at least arguable evidence of a correlation between small/cute things and high/front vowels like the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;kitty&quot; on the one hand and large/powerful things and low/back vowels like the &quot;ah&quot; in &quot;large&quot; on the other. In theory, the high frequency components of that &quot;ee&quot; vowel (regardless of the overall deepness of the speaker's voice) remind us on some psychological level of small things, which tend to make higher pitch noises in nature (which is just physics: small resonance chambers make low wavelength / high frequency sounds). Vowels like &quot;ah&quot; have low frequency components so remind us of bigger things. You could even think of us as imitating small things when we make our vocal cavity small and narrow, bringing our tongue close to the roof of our mouth, to create a small resonance chamber for the &quot;ee&quot; vowel.</p>
<p>The correlation is far from perfect, but it's possible that this is at play here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some have asked for references. You can read some good ones by going on scholar.google.com and searching for phonetic symbolism, including work by the infamous Sapir (google Sapir-Whorf hypothesis for a controversial but interesting read). The concept of phonetic symbolism is quite old now and I'm not up to speed on recent research regarding it. I know that the marketing industry takes advantage of phonetic symbolism, naming products partially based on what the sounds themselves evoke. I'm not sure to what degree this phenomenon exists in non-English languages, and to what degree it's something that's learned and societal, not innate. But it's fun to think about.</p>
<p>EDIT: Woo, my first gold! Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diminution, or cutifying/smallifying things is made differently in different languages. </p>
<p>In English, and ee ending (horse, horsee) or even the prefix mini, but that's better suited for the Chinese who usually put a diminutive prefix,  小 xiǎo- meaning little, on names and other words.</p>
<p>Spanish does the same thing as English but instead of ee, it's ito for boy things and ita for girl things.</p>
<p>There are some languages that do this with what's called an infix, or adding to the middle of a word. Arabic, for instance, adds an ee sound before the last letter or names (second to last if the word is denoted as feminine with a ة) and such to make it diminutive. كمال (Kamal) but كمايل (Kamayil) means little Kamal.</p>
<p>Hebrew uses repetition to to this. כלב (kélev) is a dog כלבלב (klavláv ) would be a doggie. That's for things, for names, they replace the last syllable with &quot;-ik&quot;, &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-le&quot; depending on what sounds better. </p>
<p>Lastly, languages like Esperanto have diminution, however, the new word is a new thing, not like dog and doggie. Esperanto uses the &quot;-et&quot; ending with &quot;o&quot; or &quot;a&quot; after it to denote boy or girl thing. but if domo is house, dometo means cottage (little house). Names are shortened to the root of the word and &quot;-nj-&quot; for girls and &quot;-ĉj-&quot; for boys are used. So Aleksandra (Alexandria) becomes Alenja (Sandy, Sandra)</p>
<p>I tried my best to make my words easy to understand so that a five year old could follow along. I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it also happens in Portuguese. But it happens in many different forms.</p>
<p>Like, if I was gonna say &quot;doggy&quot;, I could say:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cachorrinho (means &quot;little dog&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cãozinho (also means &quot;little dog&quot; [dog = cão = cachorro])</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>auau (sound of their barks in Portuguese, usually used because it's way easier to say than &quot;cachorrinho&quot;, for example)</p>
</li>
<li>totó (common generic name for dogs, also used as a synonym and easier to say)</li>
</ul>
<p>They're usually used to induce the children to learn how to speak easier, to associate an object with one of its characteristics (like &quot;auau&quot; associates the dog bark), or to make it sound cuter. A cat isn't as cute as a kitty, as well as a &quot;cão&quot; isn't as cute as a &quot;cãozinho&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
