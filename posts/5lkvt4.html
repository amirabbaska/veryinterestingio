		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acne is a &quot;multi-factor&quot; process.</p>
<p>Dirt/bacteria from the environment isn't the only or biggest reason for acne.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sebum</li>
<li>Androgen/Testerone</li>
<li>P. Acnes Bacteria</li>
<li>Keratin</li>
<li>Dead skin cells</li>
<li>Clogged pore</li>
</ol>
<p>First you have Sebaceous glands that release sebum which help lubricate your face for protection to keep foreign bodies, but when sebum gets stuck in the gland it's like glue.</p>
<p>Androgen (male) hormones help push the sebum out of your glands, but when you have a change in hormone levels, sebum is pushed out more rapidly and if the gland is blocked, the sebum is collecting inside while not being pushed out.</p>
<p>In our bodies we have the P. Acnes bacteria: it is an anaerobic bacteria and therefore cannot survive in an environment with oxygen. So the P. Acnes bacteria thrives when the gland is blocked because there is no oxygen and it feeds off of our sebum.</p>
<p>Keratin makes parts of our bodies harder (heh). The mixture of sebum, bacteria and keratin becomes a hard plug under the skin.</p>
<p>Just to add to the fun, dead skin cells also collect inside, especially if they are not washed off correctly.</p>
<p>When the gland remains closed off, nothing can secrete out of it. The clogged gland is at this point, filled with P. Acnes bacteria, old sebum, dead skin cells, hard keratin and androgen hormones are trying to push it all out on schedule but everything is stuck inside the gland with nowhere to go. This is what forms a pimple/pustule.</p>
<p>That is the basic process of acne.</p>
<p>The sebaceous glands are only located on certain parts of your body and therefore are not effected by this process. So your hands and feet aren't going to form pimples just because they touch dirt.</p>
<p>One could say the main cause is the P. Acnes bacteria. But the right conditions need to be met in order for a pimple to form.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert here but I believe it is caused by the sebaceous glands becoming blocked. Since there are many more sebaceous glands on the face, more chances for them to become blocked. Sebaceous glands excrete oil, known as sebum, to help lubricate the skin. When they become clogged, the gland continues excreting sebum. With the gland clogged, it becomes inflamed and thus, a pimple. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acne is, basically, a clogged pore (hair follicle) that becomes infected (by a specific strain of bacteria). Factors that reduce the frequency of infection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>desquamation (exfoliation)</li>
<li>sebum production (how much oil your skin exudes)</li>
<li>hygiene (how sanitary your skin is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some reasons acne is more common on the face:</p>
<ul>
<li>The skin on your face is thinner than skin on most other parts of the body.</li>
<li>The skin on your face also produces more sebum than other parts of your body. </li>
<li>We don't exfoliate our faces as much (friction from clothing helps with body). </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a swing at a possible explanation, albeit I'm no expert on the subject so maybe I can give something to think about until the experts roll in. So for starters, pimples are caused by inflammation of your pores. This is typically due to a bacterial infection, where the bacteria seep in to the pore, then your body attacks it which causes the redness, swelling, and puss. Although the pore itself may become blocked by oil which also results in pimples.</p>
<p>Now as to why it specifically happens more on the face, the answer is it generally doesn't. Acne occurs primarily in areas which are ripe in hair follicles. Thus why back acne, and pubic acne exist, and you may sometimes find acne on your arms and bum. This is due to the sebaceous glands, which secrete sebum, or oil, on to the hair follicle. Because of them neighboring so close together, there's the greater chance of bacteria getting in, although it's attacked pretty quickly and doesn't penetrate further. </p>
<p>Along with that, sebum can sometimes get blocked up and cause acne that way as well. While hair follicles are found throughout the body, sebaceous glands are primarily found in the facial, chest, and pubic regions. Thus why they're more prevalent in these areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
