		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our genes dictate much about what we are, from our eye color to disposition to some kinds of diseases, such as sickle cell anemia. That being said, genes are also linked to our sleep patterns. Scientists have identified a gene mutation that allows one not only to function on less sleep but also to experience fewer effects of sleep deprivation even after an all-nighter. The gene in question is called BHLHE41 and the variant is called p.Tyr362His.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to work at a sleep lab doing sleep apnea therapy. (Polysomnograms)</p>
<p>One person's 10 hours of sleep is not equivalent to another person's 10 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>There are 4 established stages of sleep, categorized into REM or Non-REM. These are categorized by the patterns of your brain waves. However, if you have sleep problems (sleep apnea, bruxism, restless leg, etc etc) then you're not going to get the quality sleep that you need.</p>
<p>So if I sleep 10 hours but get 2 hours of REM sleep versus someone who can not get deeper stages of sleep (I've seen people with zero rem sleep during a night's study) then I'm going to be more 'refreshed'.  One thing to note is that the level of oxygen your body gets during your sleep.  When you have obstructive sleep apnea, your breathing passages in your neck get obstructed and literally start to choke you in and out of sleep. 1) You fall asleep to lighter stages of sleep 2) your air passage get obstructed by apnea and your oxygen levels drop 3) your brain kicks you awake 4) your stage of sleep gets reset and you can not reach deeper stages</p>
<p>I've seen bad cases of apnea where people are having 'episodes' of choking 40+ times per hour.  This is the reason why you have some people who sleep 10-12 hours and feel even more tired. Imagine spending 10 hours everyday choking awake 40 times an hour where your oxygen levels drop dangerously.  Then imagine sleeping like that for 20 years. Sleep apnea has also been linked to depression, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, weight gain...</p>
<p>A good example of good sleep: BABIES
They sleep at extremely high levels of oxygen intake (high 90's like 97-99%) they can also have deep sleep up to 50% of their sleep in REM (in adults it's usually around 15-20%)</p>
<p>It's all about the 'quality' of sleep you get. With all genetics aside, in America we have 1/3 obesity and with all that extra weight crushing our air passages, sleep apnea is a growing issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with the quality of sleep your body allows you to have. Between me and my husband there are clear cut differences: </p>
<p>He:</p>
<ul>
<li>falls asleep instantly </li>
<li>sleeps an average 5-6 hours and is totally fine</li>
<li>doesn't move in his sleep</li>
<li>doesn't remember any dreams</li>
<li>doesn't wake up to use the bathroom (perhaps once in a blue moon)</li>
<li>when he goes to sleep, his sole purpose is to sleep. It's his escapism. </li>
</ul>
<p>I:
-coach myself to fall asleep
-tried many techniques to go into relaxation mode</p>
<ul>
<li>toss and turn like a fish out of water</li>
<li>have vivid and crazy dreams that are an accumulation of my worries and past events</li>
<li>wake up to the bathroom at least 2x every night
-sleep 8-9 hours and still don't feel like I'm bursting with energy. </li>
</ul>
<p>So his 5 hours of sleep is way more efficient than my 8-9 hours. </p>
<p>That's why I think he functions better. He doesn't ever drink coffee, tea, pop, or energy drinks btw. And he is active from the moment he wakes up until he falls asleep.  And I'm here like: daf...q -_- </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here,  I work 24 hours on shift, with 48 hours off.  In our 911 system we're very busy and more often then not we don't sleep at all.  Initially it was very difficult to be alert constantly, but the human body is amazing and able to compensate.  With repetition and training, being awake with little to no sleep becomes normal.  Enough so that I just finished a busy 24 hour shift and am about to get breakfast.  </p>
<p>That being said being awake that long exposes the body to a lot of stress over a lifetime.  I'll try to link the study but being up for 24 straight hours is the equivalent of a .10 BAC.  </p>
<p>Edit. Found the article.</p>
<p>Edit 2.  I missed my cake day by 1 day. unreal.  </p>
