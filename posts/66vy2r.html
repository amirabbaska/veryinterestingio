		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Xeon processors allow you to use ECC (Error-correcting code) memory.  This is crucial in servers because it allows the memory to self correct data corruption in most instances.</p>
<p>It also provides more virtualization functionality which is common in servers today.  </p>
<p>On top of these two major differences they also allow for multiple CPUs in the same workstation and generally come in higher core counts which is beneficial to a server doing many tasks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with support for ECC memory, Xeon processors are &quot;certified&quot; by Intel to produce mathematically consistent and correct results. Your home budget spreadsheet will be ok if the 32nd decimal place of a one time calculation is incorrect. But, it your a High-Frequency Trader making millions on stock transactions, then any minute calculation error will be very expensive over time. Some Xeons that fail certification  become i7 processors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Server&quot; changes over time in enterprise environments. It used to mean a very high power dedicated machine. But today it might just as well mean a very high powered VMware environment running virtual servers. </p>
<p>The Xeon has a few things going for it that make it suitable for enterprise server or vm environments. </p>
<p>It has a lot of cores which allows for extensive multitasking or multithreaded application support. VM environments can also assign dedicated CPU cores to a particular virtual machine. </p>
<p>It has a large amount of on board L1, L2, and L3 cache to speed up memory access which helps servers with high input and output IOPS  requirements. And it supports ECC memory which is a kind of RAM with built in parity checking that prevents errors and crashes caused by radiation and electromagnetic noise altering memory values. Basically it's RAM that will keep accurate values in all conditions. Normal desktop computers use non ECC memory and if a random neutron goes zipping through a memory chip and changes a 0 to a 1 it can cause corruption or a system crash. It's rare, but when you need 99.99% up time vs 99% uptime it's worth it. </p>
<p>Lastly, the number of PCIx lanes and northbridge functions allow Xeons to support very high input output operations a second (IOPS) with high speed access to multiple high performance RAID arrays, network adapters running anywhere from 1GBPS to 10GBPS, as well as multiple processor setups where a motherboard accepts 2 or more Xeon processors together. </p>
<p>Xeon chips also support a slightly different instruction set than say an I7 desktop processor. This allows it to more efficiently execute common commands you might find in an enterprise Linux environment or VMware ESXI environment. </p>
<p>One of the products I work on at my job has 16 to 32 cores and it's mission critical function is very high network, disk, and memory IOPS. The Xeon chips help it to achieve this with high bandwidth dedicated PCI express lanes, fast memory access and caching, and multiple cores allow threading of child processes to individual cores. Like 2 cores keep the database clean, 4 run DB queries, 2 handle GUI rendering, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
