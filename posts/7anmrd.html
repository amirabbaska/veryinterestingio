<p>Behaviorally there still seems to be significant debate, but from at least 50,000 YBP humans were behaviorally modern, meaning using language, and possessing symbolic thought and art. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Archeologist/anthropologist checking in here.</p>
<p>The posters suggesting that there are no biological differences in humans are correct.  Remember, it was over 10k years BP that Native Americans came to North America from Asia.  Despite millennia of isolation, they were still genetically and sexually compatible biologically with old world individuals.  I think that this truly demonstrates how little we as a people have changed in the time period you've specified.</p>
<p>The biggest difference in humanity over the past 12k years though, is the speed with which we've been able to construct, integrate and share new forms of material culture.  12k years ago basically everyone was living in hunting/gathering communities.  6k years ago you see things like the pyramids being built in Egypt.  Today we have the internet, airplanes, and computers.  They have changed the way we approach the world.  And honestly probably make us unrecognizable to our ancestors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Global mindset and perspective of other countries. This was almost completely unknown 12k years ago. </p>
<p>If behaviors count then hygiene. Its also the thing that has increased lifespan the most alongside communal living with less dangerous animals nearby. </p>
<p>Circumcision has history of about 3000 years max meaning 6-12k years ago, everyone was uncircumcised.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
