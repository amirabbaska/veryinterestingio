		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally it's because they are near other lights. They are designed so that you can only see the light from a certain location, which also sometimes limits the distance from which you can see it.</p>
<p>If you have a weird 3 way stop it might there's sorta looks like this _\|  where all three of those lines are going into an intersection. It could be feasible that someone on that angle street could see regular lights for one of the other streets and assume they are following the correct order. The 'foggy lights' would prevent others from even being able to see the lights of the other lane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're generally visible from multiple directions. By reducing their visibility until you're near them, you are less likely to mistake it for the proper light of the direction you're travelling. If someone saw a green light there and mistook it for a green light in the direction they're travelling, they may blow through a red light at full speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my area these are used in city blocks with multiple intersections in them, like where a major driveway [ex: mall] or an alley has a light, and often where multiple driveways like this dump in the same block. The other common area I see them is where diagonal streets cross a straight-angle street creating a triangle intersection.</p>
<p>I think it is to reduce the likelihood that someone will be watching the wrong light and stop or go at a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For us, it's usually intersections that the lights are hard to see because of the sun.  I know, sounds illogical but they truly work in those lifting conditions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That foggy light diffusion is caused by a piece called a Fresnel lens installed in front of the light source. Like the other commenters have said, they make the light somewhat directional to help you quickly decipher which light is your light in a complicated intersection. Only drivers in direct line of the beam will be able to see the light clearly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
