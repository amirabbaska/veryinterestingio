		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a banking employee, and did a stint in our financial and accounting services division, the area of the bank that handles payments to the bank. This isn't specifically inter-customer transfers, but rather payments that the bank does to vendors or that vendors pay to the bank.</p>
<p>As has been noted in other comments in the thread, before payments go through there are several controls that need to be passed. Most of these are automated (checking if the account being paid into doesn't belong to an ISIS affiliate, seeing if someone with a $2000 salary isn't suddenly getting a $250,000 payment, etc). However, these still need to be manually approved by at least 3 different people (in our world). This doesn't mean that 3 different people are looking at your payment before clicking &quot;Accept&quot;, but more that 3 different people are looking at a list of payments with all the details listed before batch loading them to the payment structure. They're just looking for anything that looks &quot;out of place&quot;; so either big payments, irregular payments or maybe something weird like someone paying themselves 1 cent from a million different bank accounts. 99.99% of the time, they don't pick anything up because the computers have already picked up the problem, but that's not the point.</p>
<p>The point is that now one bank employee can't just grab money from wherever and dump it into whichever account they want. Requiring 3 randomly assigned people to perform the check ON TOP of the computerize system reduces the (mostly internal) fraud rate to a level that most banks can live with. In other words, their risk and insurance are low enough because of this that they are willing to risk it happening, weed out 3 bad apples with one stone and then moving on.</p>
<p>What this also ensures is that someone who hacks into the system over the weekend cannot automatically pay themselves a million bucks, go to cash machines to withdraw it all and the bank (and maybe even customers) sit with their thumbs up their assholes come Monday morning. </p>
<p>tl;dr: the actual payment doesn't require a multi-step human intervention. Preventing fraud, collusion or an inside job does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have not worked in a bank, so I don't know it in detail. But as an accountant/finance manager I have worked in a treasury function for a company having the main contact with our banks.</p>
<p>The first I would point to is control. All the banks I spoke with said that even if processes are very automated and there is no person sitting there typing in the payment all over again, there are still people signing off on payments before it gets executed. I believe it's around ensuring documentation is correct and look after the controls etc. They don't say much about exactly what they do, they just tell me there are manual checks before it is executed. I think only some ACH payments were fully automated at the bank, but I believe that had other centralized controls.</p>
<p>And you want people/employees, to be responsible. These two trusted employees jointly said this batch is OK to execute. And not just that responsibility disappearing into a &quot;but the system...&quot;</p>
<p>You can have error handling. Missing mandatory information, especially for cross border payments or foreign exchange. There were situations where they needed a correction/additional information from us on the same day or else they would for example have to reverse currency trades since they can't hold that currency.</p>
<p>Banks also needs to ensure their own liquidity and any requirements they have around that. And they have reporting requirements to the central bank / regulatory authority. So end of the day, they need to reports positions etc. </p>
<p>Even if it looks very automated on the front end for us. We use online banking and you think you do things directly into the account, then there is still quite a big machinery behind it with checks, reconciliations, FX trades, transactions with the central bank, reports etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for one of the &quot;big 4&quot; here in Australia. I e been working with our electronic banking systems for nearly 20 years. </p>
<p>I'll talk about the standard over night processing of electronic payments here done on the &quot;Direct Entry&quot; system. I'll leave our RTGS and IMT payments, although answer still basically applies. </p>
<p>The main reason electronic banking is work days is that the systems the banks use were designed and built when electronic banking first kicked off a few decades ago. They're shit and only understand workdays. We've got a shiny new system that banks 24/7 and payments made to other customers are in real time. But we can't exchange payment information with other banks because there simply isn't the infrastructure for it. APCA/BECS set what the banks minimum requirements are here. It's in serious news of an overhaul here. And that's where NPP will bring some relief. Just don't believe the hype. It's VERY expensive area to play and he banks won't spend that kind of money lightly. Basically unless made to by the the governing body. One of the major banks spent billions upgrading their system from the decades old mainframe system to one now capable of real time payments </p>
<p>most, if not all, banks have 24/7 monitoring and system support. So, there's always someone around for approvals, support and job monitoring. So staff availability is NOT why. And we don't whore your money over the weekends for profit :/</p>
<p>Source: have been in electronic banking for nearly 20 years</p>
<p>hope this makes sense. Typing this shit on a phone is not It easy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former US banking technology executive here from one of the largest banks.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons and there is no simple one answer, which is what people typically expect. eg the banks are greedy and just want to hold onto your money for as long as possible.</p>
<p>It depends on what area the bank the transfer is being done in and what the instrument is -- checking, credit card, auto finance, home finance, check processing, atm, etc.</p>
<p>First, each one of these areas has their own systems and their own regulations that they have to abide by. </p>
<p>Second, all of these areas have different systems that were built at different times and work differently. There is no 'uber' computer system that everything runs through but rather a series of discreet systems that do processing at different levels and then eventually end up in the SOR (statement of record). That is the system that says, you have $146.34 in your account.</p>
<p>The bank could extend you credit and typically will if you are a good customer will for some amount of the check in advance of collecting the funds from the remitting bank, but it may have to go through the Fed to be processed, through another bank in another state, or through a small local S&amp;L. In that case the lowest common denominator is the other institution and how long it takes them to process the transaction and pay your institution.</p>
<p>The other thing that everyone expects is that everything electronically happens in real-time, just like at the ATM. The reality is that MOST bank systems are batch based and the batch is processed nightly. In banking it is called online and even today only a small number of the systems are online.</p>
<p>It used to be that the banks did want to hold your money for as long as possible or would take advantage of the processing time to make money on the overnight which is based on the Fed Funds rate, but with interest rates so low for so long, there is little advantage to that anymore. Which is also why you get whacked with fees for everything -- that is main way banks make money now, collecting ridiculous fees for everything they do.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned by others, fraud prevention is another thing that slows the flow of money down but at the largest institutions that is typically done programmatically.</p>
<p>Most people assume that retail banking is at the cutting edge of technology, but the reality is the underlying systems are all really old, most run on mainframes, most are batch based, and there is nothing like Stripe.com in any of the large old-line banks, which is why it can still take three days for a check to clear in the 21st century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's just a lot of wrong answers here. I worked for a bank. We originally gave customers immediate access to funds deposited via ATM/mobile deposit outside of banking hours, but a lot of people abused it. Shitty customers would frequently deposit empty envelopes into the ATM and punch in like $500, and then just immediately withdraw it. College kids would mobile deposit their financial aid checks and then go to the bank and deposit the exact same check, double their money, and then immediately take it out. We ended up losing money due to fraudsters and had to start placing holds on them until the next business day. </p>
<p>That's literally it. We didn't stack the orders of your transactions or hold it to gain interest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
