		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lawyer here:  </p>
<p>Here's a real simple example.  You come to court to sue a guy for smashing your car with a bat.  Best part is, you've got him dead to rights--you have a video of him smashing your car with a bat.  It was captured by your neighbour's surveillance camera.  </p>
<p>And you lose, because the court won't accept your video.</p>
<p>Why?  Well, in my area to admit a video you need to authenticate the video--ie, to show that it's accurate, that it hasn't been tampered with, to tell the court what it is (ie, that this is a surveillance camera that points to the street and not a staged film or whatever), and so on.  </p>
<p>Now, you can try to testify about those things, except that it'd be hearsay, because it wasn't your camera, and you just got it from your neighbour.</p>
<p>A lawyer would spot this issue right away and solve it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/varsil has a good comment, but I want to offer another answer as well.  The example he has offered is actually one that is possible to &quot;fix&quot;.  There are a lot of jurisdictions that have courts for small value disputes where the rules of evidence are relaxed and the assumption is we don't have to worry about some kind of hollywood budget digital fakery of evidence because you wouldn't spend 100K to doctor a video for a 10K lawsuit.  Also, assuming this isn't a jury trial, the simple fact video exists - even if not admitted into evidence - can't help but weigh on the judge's mind.  You can still testify that you saw your neighbour beat up your car, or that he said he was going to get you and then the next day your car was beat to hell.  He might deny doing it on the stand but a smart judge would probably look at him and say &quot;Mr. So and so, I want you to understand something.  Perjury is a crime, you don't pay a fine for it, you go to jail.  If you are testifying today that you didn't hit his car then you can, but I am going to take this tape, that wasn't admitted into evidence today, and I am going to give it to the police officers here and ask them to investigate it and if it turns out the tape is real I can promise you that you are going to be charged with a crime for your testimony today.  People do not get away with lying in my courtroom.  Do you understand that?&quot;  </p>
<p>The real issue, as I see it (and nothing against the truth of the comment more generally), goes to paperwork, timelines, and court process.</p>
<p>Even a fairly simple case is going to have at least seven or eight really important deadlines associated with it that the average person will know absolutely nothing about.  You will need to prepare and file paperwork using the court's forms (which are generally not easy to fill out and easy to make a mistake on), and often you will try to file something, have it rejected, amend it, try to file it a second time, and have it rejected again.  This is a frustrating process and a lot of people just kind of give up on it after a while (whether they drop the case or hire a lawyer).  </p>
<p>Or you have a deadline, you know about the deadline, and you go to file your paperwork on the last day only to have it rejected by the court for a technical problem with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you aren't a pilot, imagine how unlikely it would be to take off, fly to your destination, and successfully land a plane you were completely unfamiliar with. You know where you are on the map, and where you want to go, and the exact path you need to follow, but none of that matters because the formalities of operating the system are completely alien to you.
Matters of form which are completely un-intuitive and indeed deliberately obfuscatory are integral to legal proceedings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It happens more than you would think, and it actually doesn't go <em>as</em> badly as you'd imagine. </p>
<p>On lower level cases like traffic and little misdemeanors, people actually give it a shot.</p>
<p>In my experience people who represent themselves fall into two categories: people who don't trust the public defenders, and the mentally ill.</p>
<p>The former group tends to do...ok.  A few jurisdictions have <em>excellent</em> public defenders, but the sad truth is most...don't. So people wing it. In my experience, judges and prosecutors effectively &quot;take it easy&quot; on these clients. Although the judge reads out a lengthy warning saying that no one will take it easy, in practice, everyone takes it easy. Rules of evidence are kind of...relaxed, and everyone kinda gives the person &quot;hints&quot; on what to do. </p>
<p>I've actually seen some people do pretty alright for themselves. Again, I'm talking traffic tickets and jaywalking level stuff here. </p>
<p>Sadly, the BIGGEST group of people who represent themselves are mentally ill. It's sad. They're in the system because of their mental illness, they refuse assistance because of their mental illness, and they do a poor job representing themselves because of their mental illness. </p>
<p>The worst part is that this group doesn't really care about what they're charged with. They'll try to go it alone on a murder just as quickly as a parking ticket. </p>
<p>Just wanted to give some background, but short answer is: knowledge of rules of evidence, and years of experience knowing how to be verbally persuasive to a judge and jury. That's what you get with a lawyer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
