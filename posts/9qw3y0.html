		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of stuff about masks and influenza here, it's a good discussion. </p>
<p>However I'm not seeing anything about covering one's eyes - in the U.S. proper hospital airborne droplet isolation includes eye covers - <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/disposable-safety-goggles_60590882703.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.34.33001240JpWLmq" target="_blank">plastic glasses</a>, a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/disposable-face-mask-with-eye-protection_909938168.html" target="_blank">mask-with-eye-protection</a>, or a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/face-sheild-blue-and-white-protective_60649228923.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.2017203.1.177d3e37z4ihSl&amp;s=p" target="_blank">full face shield</a>. </p>
<p>The eyes are an exposed mucous membrane that can pick up viruses and bacteria just as easily as nasal or mouth mucosa. It might explain why a mask alone is not as effective as mask + handwashing; if nothing else with a full face shield or glasses on you're less likely to touch your eyes.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This would be hard to quantify. For one face masks are common in areas that very high density (i.e. metropolitan Chinese cities), where infections are likely high. It may reduce however.</p>
<p>But also cold and flu is more commonly spread by touching a surface and rubbing an opening such as an eye. I would assume that so long as the infected themselves wash their hands perhaps. But ince you touch a surface and dont wash your hands you are basically doomed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
