<p>And fun fact even large trucks can set off ligo which is one reason they constantly check with each other to eliminate the possibility of false positives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LIGO is unique as an observatory in that you cannot just build one.  You need to build at least two a long way (1000's of km) apart.</p>
<p>So nuclear bomb, truck driving by, and all those things will affect one detector  in a very different way then the other detector.  </p>
<p>Some type of astronomical event, however, should affect the two detectors at similar times and in similar ways.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the above comments have stated, there are ways to distinguish the signals you are not looking for (noise) from those you are indeed looking for. Using general relativity and physical models, physicists were able to predict exactly what the signal(s) of passing gravitational waves emitted by two merging black holes was going to look like. This is why two detectors were constructed hundreds of miles apart from each other. Signals that show up on one detector (noise generated from a passing car for example) but do not show up on the other detector, unless extreme coincidence is at play, are treated as noise because any passing gravitational waves will influence both detectors in a similar fashion, at almost the exact same time, depending on which direction the gravitational waves propagate from. </p>
<p>Combine the methods of discriminating against noise and actually having algorithms that know what a black hole &quot;blip&quot; is supposed to look like makes mundane things such as passing cars a non-issue when it comes to false-positives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a tour at LIGO a few years before they first measured gravitational waves. They said that the instruments pick up vibrations from the surrounding logging operations miles away. They did their best to build in a secluded area but there's no such thing as a measurement without noise. Hence the second LIGO center to rule out the noise factor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
