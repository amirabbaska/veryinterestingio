I was sure we'd get pulled over, so the whole front of my body instantly got hot. The cop pulled out of his spot and went in the other direction, so we didnt get pulled over, but it was scary. What is the feeling I felt? I feel it whenever someone gives me devastating news, or I remember a deadline I'd forgotten for weeks</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cells run on oxygen and sugar. Your body uses blood to transport oxygen and sugar to your cells. One of the things that caps your ability to do stuff is the rate at which your blood can do its job. Having more blood helps blood transport stuff faster.</p>
<p>Your body is full of little blood sponges. These otherwise boring organs hold on to a bunch of blood. When your brain hits the panic button, it releases chemical signals (including adrenaline) which, among other things, tell those blood sponges to squeeze. This pushes a bunch of extra blood into your system.</p>
<p>This extra blood helps you perform better. In a natural setting, for example, it'll give you that extra push you need to sprint away from that lion, or climb that tree to safety, or stay awake even though something bit off your foot. </p>
<p>The feeling of those little sponges (most of which are in your abdomen) squeezing is what feels like your heart dropping or your stomach tightening. All of that extra blood is what makes you get hot and red.</p>
<p>Athletes can take advantage of this process by simply injecting themselves with extra blood in a process called &quot;doping.&quot; It's basically just having an external blood sponge that you have more direct control over.</p>
<p>Our modern brain has not yet adapted to our lack of danger. This is why we sometimes experience this when, for example, we see a cop or hear bad news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is likely to be a sudden increase in your heart's stroke volume, due to the positive inotropic effect of adrenaline.</p>
<p>When you are stressed, adrenaline is secreted directly into the bloodstream by the adrenal gland. It has two broad effects on the cardiovascular system. One is to increase the force and rate of contraction (ino/chronotropy) of the heart and also to constrict blood vessels.</p>
<p>The feeling of your heart dropping is the sensation of increased myocardial filling and force of contraction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
