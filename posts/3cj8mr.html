		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with the basic of what's a stock market. It is a place where companies sell parts of themselves in the form of pieces of paper that grant the owner a claim to partial ownership of the company. These pieces of paper are called stocks. Who do these companies sell themselves to? To the public. To a group of people who have money and interest in buying part of these companies as an investment. These people are &quot;the investors&quot;.</p>
<p>In most countries, most companies in the stock market are mostly owned by &quot;the investors&quot; in a public stock market. In China, most big companies are owned in whole or part by the government. In the Chinese stock market, when you buy a stock, your ownership of the company is very limited, as the government calls all the shots.</p>
<p>To add to that, China hadn't allowed most people to invest in the stock market until recently. The Chinese stock market used to be available only to super rich Chinese banks and exclusive investors. That changed recently, and millions of chinese people with savings (China has one of the highest savings ratios in the world), decided to put their money on the stock market.</p>
<p>This sudden and rapid influx of capital caused a bubble. Naturally, the bubble bursted and now the prices are going &quot;back to normal&quot;, causing a lot of regular chinese people to lose a lot of their life savings.</p>
<p>Fearing the wrath of the middle class, China has started bailing out the stock market, ordering government or party-controlled banks, investors, and companies to buy back stock to prop-up the price, even if the price isn't justified.</p>
<p>Because of the impact of the stock market in China is low due to its insulation from the broader economy, the whole fiasco is of limited significance. However, it sets a dangerous precedent that foreign investors are naturally concerned about. China appears more preoccupied with how a stock market looks in the media, than with the actual health of its financial markets. And it seems that, right now, it is ok for them to do this since China's government is the main engine of their financial system, and not the market itself. The recent moves indicate that China is not serious in changing this anytime soon, nor is it prepared to do it. Right now, that's fine, but over time, it could drag China's growth in the next decade or two.</p>
<p>People concerned with the next decade or two are mad at the government for the poor way with which they liberalized the stock market, and the irresponsible way they bailed out. People concerned with the next quarter don't care this is happening at all.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many shareholders of Chinese stocks want to sell those shares.  Buyers are not abundant, so prices are dropping.  Some of the least desirable stocks can't be sold at any price; other companies do not believe the current price reflects the worth of their shares so have requested that trading in their shares be halted.  Apart from that, what is basically happening is the 'price discovery' mechanism of a free market; today, market participants are discovering that Chinese shares are worth less than previously thought.</p>
<p>The consequences are complicated.  There is a concept called 'mark to market.'  Suppose I own 100 shares of XYZ corporation.  Suppose that the last share sale of XYZ took place at a price of $50 per share.</p>
<p>It's reasonable to say that I own $5000 worth of XYZ corporation.  In fact, that is what people usually say.  Banks say it when they calculate up the assets that they hold.</p>
<p>Now suppose that on a day like today, there are no buyers for XYZ corporation shares at $50, $40, or even $30.  Some guy buys a few shares for $15, probably from another guy who is desperate to get some cash at any price.  Now, the last trade price on XYZ is $15 per share.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my own account, which yesterday I 'marked' as being worth $5000, is now 'marked' as being worth only $1500.  I have lost $3500 worth of assets from my net worth, even though I didn't do anything and even though XYZ corporation - its assets, its inventory, its operations, its real value - is the same as it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Mark to market is a pleasant fiction.  If <em>all</em> the shares of XYZ were to be sold on the open market, one would not get the same price for all of them.  As buyers became exhausted at a given price, the price would have to fall in order to find more buyers.  But because of mark-to-market, days like today cause wealth destruction among holders of shares.</p>
<p>It's how things are supposed to work.  I'm always surprised when people who participate in the markets are upset on a day like this; today's events are part of what stock markets are supposed to do.  Articles like the Economist article linked elsewhere are best explained as retconning; I do not think articles like this ever add one bit of insight.  The price action is where the truth is, not articles. </p>
<p>However, imagine if you were an article author and sought to provide the truth.  Every article you ever wrote about a day like today would look like this:  &quot;Sellers outnumbered buyers, so prices fell.&quot;  Your articles, though accurate, relevant and containing all the important information, would look very similar day after day, so no one would read them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put the market specificially in the tech sector was overvalued and was due for a correction. The whole incident is a little different than what was seen in Europe and the USA as other economic health indicators are still strong.</p>
<p>However the Chinese central bank has not helped things and has slashed interest rates to crazy low levels along with halting all sorts of trading. </p>
<p>This Economist article does a great job explaining things.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say people like apples. In the USA, you have to buy apples through a store - that is the only way you can buy apples here. In China, you can buy apples directly from the farm. Problem is, the Chinese people aren't apple experts. They don't know what makes a good apple. In the USA, the stores are apple pros- they know what to look for, which apples to buy, etc. Since the chinese are buying apples like madmen, the $ of apples go up. The govt even tells them to borrow $ to buy apples. Mortgage your home! Whatever it takes! At some point, someone is gonna say hey, apples shouldn't be worth this much. All of a sudden, apple $ starts to fall (this is called a correction - back to normal). All the banks you borrowed money from to buy apples like mad men? They want their $ (margin call). All these unsavvy Apple buyers are losing their $ since the apple $ is falling. They can't afford to pay back the banks. The govt is trying to buy apples to prop up the market, but it looks like it's still sliding. </p>
<p>There's other things like the real estate bust and slowdown of general growth, but people are pointing to unsavvy individual investors and overspeculation in the market as the primary cause for this massive slide. China may be facing a Depression. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spoke with a few Chinese people about this while I was in China. They all pretty much knew somebody who put $1K into the stock market and made $10 million in 90 days. This small group of people who made big bucks early made everyone want to do the same thing. Who wouldn't want to replicate that success?</p>
<p>The problem is that nobody has experience investing. You have a large population of 20 year old people investing tons of money who have nobody to teach them what's going on and have no experience about what to do when the market turns around. We're talking about a country where parents are rice farmers and the children are driving a Lamborghini.</p>
<p>Everyone was just dumping money into random sucky stocks without regard to how good they actually are. When the market started to head down they were all holding because they thought it would just go down a little and then head straight up again. When it went down a lot they don't know how to cut their losses. Nobody I spoke to in China actually knows how to short sell stocks and make money on the down side.</p>
<p>Pretty much this boils down to an entire country that has never invested before all doing it at once and creating a huge bubble. Everyone buys together and everyone dumps together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
