		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a force in nuclei which acts to pair nucleons together (protons with protons and neutrons with neutrons). It's called the <em>nuclear pairing force</em>, and it prefers for all nucleons to be paired off.</p>
<p>So clearly this force is &quot;happiest&quot; when there is an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons. In fact out of the 254 known stable nuclides, 148 have even Z and even N, but only 5 have odd Z and odd N. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_atomic_nuclei#Pairing_effects" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>If a nucleus is going to be even-even, it must have even Z. So even Z elements, &quot;averaging over isotopes&quot;, are a more favorable nuclear configuration than odd Z elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we are all just stardust!</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>All the heavy elements in our solar system, (and by heavy elements I mean anything that isn't hydrogen or helium) is basically a product of a supernova, barfing it's contents across the cosmos.  None of the oxygen, carbon, silicon, sulfur, iron, etc... was produced <em>in situ</em> by our sun, it was produced as fusion products in another, far older, far more massive, long-dead star.</p>
<p>So let's talk about how stars produce elements, shall we?  In stars like our Sun the primary source of Hydrogen burning is a process called the proton-proton chain.  Two protons fuse to form a Helium with no neutrons, which is very unstable.  The vast majority of them decay right back into to protons, but occasionally one of the protons undergoes a beta-plus decay, emitting a positron &amp; a neutrino to transmogrify into a neutron.  At that point you've got Deuterium, which can much more easily fuse with a proton to form He^3 , which is stable.  Eventually that He^3 captures another neutron and you end up with garden-variety helium.  In stars more massive than our sun with significant amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen already present, a more efficient process known as the CNO cycle catalyzes the fusion, but the end result is the same:  Hydrogen gets burned into Helium.  So step 1 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 H^1 --&gt; He^4 (through a variety of paths.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the star runs out of Hydrogen to burn the next stage of burning occurs, (after a collapse to higher pressure &amp; temperature) which is the triple-alpha process, where two helium nuclei - which I'm going to refer to as alphas - fuse into Be^8 ,which is highly unstable, but if it captures a <em>third</em> alpha, will fuse into stable carbon, C^12 .  So now our next equation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He^4 + He^4 + He^4 --&gt; C^12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally we have the last process, which burns heavier elements, known as the alpha process.  This is simpler, in the sense that it's just the capture of a single alpha particle by a heavier nucleii, but there are lots of flavors.  Pretty much one for every element up the chain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C^12 + He^4 --&gt; O^16</p>
<p>O^16 + He^4 --&gt; Ne^20</p>
<p>Ne^20 + He^4 --&gt; Mg^24</p>
<p>Mg^24 + He^4 --&gt; Si^28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>etc. etc. etc...</p>
<p>It's this process, the alpha process, that is responsible for much of metal production (in the context of stellar nucleosynthesis, everything that ain't Hydrogen is a metal) in pre-type 2-supernova stars.  Then, of course, they go supernova and spew their contents across the cosmos.  Like ants with fungus in their heads.</p>
<p>This is why most common elements are even in atomic number.  They're more than even in their atomic number, they're also usually integral multiples of 4 in their atomic <em>mass</em> as well, because they're all just assembled from the body parts of alphas.  If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Abundance_of_elements_in_the_Universe" target="_blank">abundance of elements in the universe</a> (which mirrors the abundance of elements in our solar system) you'll find these elements all represented.</p>
<p>Note, the answer that the nuclear pairing force encourages even-numbered protons, neutrons, and nucleii isn't wrong, <em>per se</em>.  It's actually a driving force behind these reactions: the alpha makes an excellent brick with which to assemble heavier nucleii because it is so stable because of the pairing force, and those even/even nucleii are even more stable for the same reason.  So /u/RobustEtCeleritas isn't wrong at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During interstellar nuclear synthesis, atoms of elements are typically combined to make atoms with ever increasing nuclear weight. Simply put, a Hydrogen bonds with another Hydrogen to become a Helium atom. From Helium another Helium atom is combined to make larger and larger nuclei tending to increase from one stage of stellar synthesis to the next. As more of these elements are formed in the Universe they are observed far more than other elements made from radioactive or unusual cosmic processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
