		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Call recordings are usually compressed to save storage space. </p>
<p>Audio files are big, so reducing the quality can dramatically lower the file size while still being clear enough to listen to. </p>
<p>If the police are recording every call, then it would be smart to compress all of the recordings to reduce the number of hard drives they need to buy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Source - I manage an IT Department and deal with telecom issues, including storing call recordings, on the daily.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelensnola.org/2013/04/25/911-operators-answer-hundreds-of-calls-every-day-related-to-police-officers-moonlighting/" target="_blank">Per this article</a>, a 911 center received over 69,000 calls in just December 2012 alone. If we took a conservative number from that, we get over 600,000 calls per year for one center.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.colincrawley.com/audio-file-size-calculator/" target="_blank">Per this audio file size calculator</a>, a minute of uncompressed audio could be as large as 2.8MB.</p>
<p>One minute of audio per call doesn't seem like an unreasonable assumption. So with the numbers listed above, that gives us 1.7TB of audio per year as a bare minimum. </p>
<p>For a government system, one that was likely designed and implemented many years ago, that's a lot of data to handle. Those calls need to be indexed and searchable as well, so that they can be easily accessed later if needed.</p>
<p>If you want to test my theory, call your police department's non-emergency line and see how the quality sounds. If it sounds like a normal phone call, then something must be happening during the recording process to affect the quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is because they're putting several calls down the 911 line at once and have to use compression and multiplexing.</p>
<p>There's a certain amount of bandwidth one can put down a wire at any given time. In order to put multiple calls on it at once, they filter out unneeded frequencies and change modulation and pitch and what not, and then will convert them back so they can be heard. That causes massive quality loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
