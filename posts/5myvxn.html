		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume here that we're speaking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction_chant" target="_blank">auction chant</a>, yes? Individual auctioneers develop their own style and patter, but it's still immediately recognizable as auction chant.</p>
<p>Yes, the reason they speak that way does have to do with &quot;urgency,&quot; but it's <em>not</em> just about artificially creating an atmosphere that the auctioneer hopes will encourage people to bid. There are far more practical things going on. </p>
<p>The auction chant is all about delivering just two pieces of information, distinctly, as quickly as possible: the current bid, and the next bid. All the rest is basically filler. It's okay that it's almost impossible to understand the filler as long as the <em>numbers</em> are distinct.</p>
<p>Why do things that way? Because it's the best way to move as many lots as possible, as quickly as possible. This is particularly important in commercial auctions (e.g., livestock, cars), where there is often a truly <em>staggering</em> amount of goods, both in volume and value. Also, in many cases, simply getting all of the buyers and sellers together in one place can be a real trick. For things like livestock and other commodities, simply getting everyone together in one time, at one place, so that transactions can be completed on the spot, is a <em>huge</em> logistical undertaking. Every day a buyer/seller spends at the auction is a day they're <em>not</em> spending on whatever business brought them there in the first place. If everybody can only afford to be in town for a day or two, the auctioneer had best be able to move <em>everybody's</em> inventory in that day or two. </p>
<p>Further, the auction chant has kind of become a thing in its own right. It's how people <em>expect</em> auctions to be conducted, even if it's only a single-item, (e.g., public sale of a house with no contents, etc.). The people have come out to an auction, and darn it, they wanna hear the auctioneer do his thing. So tradition has a lot to do with it, particularly in smaller auctions. </p>
<p>Of course, none of that applies to auctioneers at <em>very</em> high end houses like Cristie's, Sotheby's, etc. Those guys seem to make a point, as a matter of class/style/whatever, to hardly speak at all. As they don't really have to: there are only a few items up at any given time, and they're of sufficient cost and/or uniqueness that the items themselves generate all the interest/urgency needed. </p>
<p>Also, that godawful, plebian yelling is just <em>so</em> unsophisticated. What is this, a fish market? /s</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart of the auctioneer chant consists of two pieces of information. Piece of information #1: The current amount bid on the lot in question. Piece of information #2: The next highest bid increment. If you want the item, you have to offer that second number. When someone does, that becomes the new #1 piece of information, with the next increment being called.</p>
<p>Styles vary from place to place, but the stereotype auction chant includes a lot of 'filler', which is really just there to make it feel like something is happening, when really the auctioneer is just trying to keep dead air from happening while waiting for someone to make up their mind and raise their card. Some try to make this filler more useful, like dropping information about the item, reminding people if remote bidders are still in or out, and things like that, but really it's just to keep awkward silences from forming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked as an auctioneer as well as went to auctioneer school.  It is about creating excitement and in retail auction it can have a significant effect on how much you get for an item.</p>
<p>As an example of showmanship making a difference, I have done auctions where you are required to sell everything from an estate (often times because there is in fighting between heirs).  So nearing the end of the auction you have crap like a box of stuff that was under the kitchen sink.  You can't get anyone to pay a dollar, keeping asking for it is going to kill the mood.  You pair it with a few more boxes of crap and ask for a dollar.  The crown is dead, you are loosing them.  I take a dollar bill out of my pocket, throw it in the box and now you will get a chuckle and the very same pile of boxes will bring five bucks.  More importantly you have won back the crowd.  That is increases what you get on subsequent boxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems to be confined to certain types of auctions and places. Here in the UK, for example, you'll hear something akin to the sort of thing I assume you're talking about (continuous, near-incomprehensible gabbling) at, say, some cattle auctions - but go to the average general or fine arts auction, and you'll get something very different; much clearer, with the auctioneer often working the room with comments, observations and even jokes to get the best price (of which the auction house, naturally, takes its not-insignificant cut; good selling = more profit).</p>
<p>I can see why you might want to keep talking without saying much when, basically, you're selling the same item over and over again (&quot;Oh look, it's another bullock!&quot;), and need to fill time; outside of that, though, personally, I can't help feeling that the US-style incomprehensible auction drawl is often basically a &quot;traditional&quot; affectation that serves little to no purpose <em>per se</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
