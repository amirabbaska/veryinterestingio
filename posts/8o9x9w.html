</blockquote>
<p>Not really. It is important to note that time is not an assurance that improvement will arrive, that is just an expectation from our advances in other areas.</p>
<p>It turns out that steam turbines are just really good at producing electricity from a heat source. That isn't to say there have not been advances, but it is more in the form of better steam turbines rather than a fundamental shift in techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nuclear powered aircraft carrier sounds like it should have some Star Trek looking engine. Nope. Radiation boils water. Water turns to steam. Steam spins turbine. Turbine turns shaft. </p>
<p>Crazy that we can do all the amazing technological crap that we come up with, but haven’t found a better way to make something spin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It maybe the energy source we are tapping into for electricity generation. If you think of traditional energy sources, hydro and wind are kinetic energy sources (water and air are not reactive in generating their own electron). Natural gas and fossil fuel have a lot of chemical energy but they excel in combustion. Heat generally doesn't change chemistry but make them more energetic so we are still trying to harness kinetic energy.</p>
<p>But then look at solar and fuel cells, light is a electromagnetic wave and are not kinetic energy, so we can tap into that directly. Fuel cells work through electron exchange, so we can also ignore kinetic energy.</p>
<p>I think the way we harness energy is more source dependant than it is technology dependant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>while there are fluids with better thermal properties, they're much more expensive and tend to be fairly dangerous in one way or another.</p>
<p>methods besides turbines tend to be restricted to low power applications because of practical constraints.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
