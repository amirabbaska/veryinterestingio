<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=brain+divided&amp;restrict_sr=on" target="_blank">A search</a> doesn't reveal anything that answers this question specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, I know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Brain" target="_blank">many of the left brain/right brain claims are false</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Essentially I'm asking about the cerebrum's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_fissure" target="_blank">longitudinal fissure</a>--why would such a feature be selected for? Doesn't it waste space that could be used for more brain? Is there a benefit from inhibited interhemispheric communication?</p>
</li>
<li>And what about non-human animals--are their brains divided too? How long ago did this feature arise?</li>
</ul></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying to explain this from a human-centered perspective won't work, as paired ganglia forming a cord is a common feature of bilateria. And no, it isn't just your brain, your ENTIRE nervous system has a left and right side that are mirror images. </p>
<p>And don't believe the forebrain was a single mass that was selected to split. Remember, the chordate nervous system originates as a hollow tube which closes at the tips (if it doesn't close, you get Spina Bifida or anacephaly), then the walls keep growing in thickness. <a href="https://www.quizover.com/ocw/mirror/col11496/m46535/1302_Brain_Vesicle_DevN.jpg" target="_blank">And this is the embryonic brain</a></p>
<p>However, remember, the tip of the neural tube is not the frontal lobe of the brain, but the lamina terminalis, which is pretty much in the center of the head, just above the optic chiasm. The hemispheres are LATERAL outgrowths, they are the left and right side of the tube, which grow on their own to the point they cover the remaining parts (in birds and mammals pretty much tho). But lateralization IS the ancestral condition. The longitudinal fissure wasn't selected for, it was a remainder of when worms had left and right ganglia. The thing that was selected for was the Corpum Callossum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have answered the bilateral aspect of body development, so I'll answer the last question. Yes, all animals with brains have bilateral structures. Even animals like worms and insects that we don't necessarily refer to as having &quot;brains&quot; but rather collections of neurons known as ganglia have bilaterality of their neurons. </p>
<p>Look up images of comparisons of brains across the different animal groups. There are clear differences, but overall a lot of similarities in the overall structures present. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears that &quot;lateralization&quot; is studied at both the neurological level, and population level, which is rather interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theoretical models on the evolution of lateralization suggest that the alignment of lateralization at the population level may have evolved as an evolutionary stable strategy in which individually asymmetrical organisms must coordinate their behavior with that of other asymmetrical organisms.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer &quot;why&quot;, we'd have to identify either that it's an inevitable or emergent consequence of fundamental EVODEVO structures, or that it's selected for due to individual or population level advantages.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert, but I am currently reading a book by Iain McGilchrist called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Master-His-Emissary-Divided-Western/dp/0300188374/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527858131&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+master+and+his+emissary" target="_blank">the Master and his Emissary</a> that posits an answer to your question.
In a nutshell, his argument is that the brain is divided because that division allows each half of the brain to operate somewhat independently from the other half, allowing each half to specialize in different complimentary ways of analyzing the world, more specifically the left half deconstructs while the right half seeks broader context. A fascinating read so far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, we have bilateral symmetry throughout our whole body, which is hypothesised to be due to the way early organisms evolved.</p>
<p>See this wikipedia article : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria</a>. </p>
<p>I read about this partially in the book Other Minds which touches on the evolution of your brain/nervous system, but I'm sure there are more specific sources out there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
