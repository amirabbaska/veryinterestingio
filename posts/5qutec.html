<p>The answer is heat flux. Water transmits heat 20 times faster than air, meaning that you would be losing heat faster in water than air. To give you an example of this, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDbMEdLiCs" target="_blank">watch this video</a>. Both objects are at the same temperature, but the metal in the metal hard drive transfers heat faster so it feels colder than the book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100 °F (38 °C) water isn't too pleasant if you're immersed in it for a long time. </p>
<p>When you take a shower it is warm and pleasant because you don't overheat. A hot tub is nice and cozy because it warms you up.</p>
<p>A very weak 100 °F sauna is also nice and pleasant at first. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://extremephysiolmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-7648-3-12" target="_blank">this article</a> is a great source. It mentions that air is thermoneutral (i.e. neither raises nor lowers your body temperature) only up to ~28 degrees (because it can't carry heat as well as water), while water is thermoneutral to 35.5 degrees. So 38 degree water would only be slightly above the limit while 38 degree air would be significantly above it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100°F is pretty damned hot for water.  Most hot tubs are about that temperature, and take some serious getting used to, and can be dangerous for people in poor health.  </p>
<p>Temperature and heat are not the same thing.  Water has a very high heat capacity, which means it takes a lot of heat energy to raise it's temperature by 1 degree - it's roughly 4x that of air.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether 100°F air is comfortable or not depends a lot on other circumstances. I've discovered you can be quite comfortable at that temperature as long as (1) the humidity is very low--think desert-like; (2) you are well hydrated--maybe drinking a cool drink; (3) you are not doing any physical work; (4) you are sitting in the shade; (5) there is a light breeze; (6) you are dressed in light, loose clothing.</p>
<p>I experienced this in the eastern part of Washington state, east of the Cascades, where the humidity is typically very low in summer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
