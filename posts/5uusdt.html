		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we speak out loud there are 2 signals that the brain receives: the internal monologue and (assuming you are not deaf) auditory feedback from our speech output. This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are. Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation/speech muscles. Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other (thinking a word, with the sound of the word, and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word).</p>
<p>So if you are thinking internally, your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned, the internal monologue is extremely closely related to the production of speech (this topic is known as &quot;embodiment&quot;). Studies show that when people read text silently, muscles used for speech are slightly activated. Also, speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally. This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways, and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking.</p>
<p>Note: this is referring to clear-cut intended internal speech. More ambiguous &quot;thought&quot; is going to be much more complex.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The act of speaking, the sound of speaking, and the internal thought which is correlated with the speech, are all highly associated with each other (They use similar brain pathways). So when you &quot;hear&quot; yourself think, it is probably because you are activating the same brain pathways used for normal speech and hearing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is marvelous. All that is you are the stories you know and or believe in. Many of these clips drop unused on the cutting room floor. Most, though, make up you and the stories you believe. Let us keep focused on your question and not include genetics.</p>
<p>With one exception, all of the words we think about do, though, include genetics as a foundation, OK, enough of that.</p>
<p>Let us consider, this the inner monologue never stops during our consciousness. There is always some kind of flurry of disjointed or coherent words flowing from where to where?</p>
<p>What we are hearing are words, sentences, paragraphs, and on we go. Yet, back to your question, keep in mind that you do not own this inner monologue, it happens. You don’t control it. In the brilliance of youth they are extremely vivid monologues. As you grow older you lose your acuity as you do your muscle fibers.</p>
<p>That should be enough of a scaffold to answer your question. The answer to your question lays in what is listening to this monologue. What is listening is your body and as your body is the instrument of the brain, it plays on and on. This music coincides with your emotions that start the process. The genius of the system is that as these musical vibrations flow in and around your whole body, so does your body, using the same instrument to emerge as your awareness of what you are thinking. We are music beings. Think of stones thrown into a little pond. Each of the waves created continue on the way uninterrupted so that when it encounters another wave they slip through each other.</p>
<p>I guess there was a little more scaffold required to understand the answer after all.</p>
<p>Yet, now we are ready!</p>
<p>The anatomical devices that form words out of these directed emotions is physical. Vibration enters the interpreter and from the interpreter, words emerge according to our culture and upbringing. Well, where does free will come into this? When do we control these thoughts?</p>
<p>We don’t. The words that flow through us are a river of words and like a river directs itself on a course of least resistance. There is no free will.</p>
<p>The watched is simultaneously the watcher. This watcher translates these codes into a learned language.</p>
<p>All this is possible because each of us has a personality and it is this that is the course of least resistance. What you say to yourself is heard using your ears, but in this case there is no outside vibrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
