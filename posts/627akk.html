<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-011-0515-5" target="_blank">This article [1]</a> talks about how four legged animals are more vulnerable to lightning strikes because ground current has high chances to go through vital organs. It also describes how large animals such as giraffes and elephants have higher chances of deadly strikes. There is the obvious thing about the fact that they are tall so even under a tree there is a non-negligeable chance that lighting could <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iYzL85H.png" target="_blank">jump directly to their head</a>. The other less obvious one is that even if they are not directly hit, the large distance their legs span increased the voltage (and potentially the current) going though them (as described in<a href="http://i.imgur.com/JkPWM1K.png" target="_blank"> this figure</a>). Sadly the article lacks hard numbers on strike frequency depending on the species. </p>
<p>This <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/07/15/mammal-deaths-by-lightning/" target="_blank">blog post</a> seems to suggest that giraffes getting killed by lightning is not that uncommon. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1996 and 1999 the Rhino and Lion Reserve near Krugersdorp, South Africa, had two of its three giraffes killed by lightning – the third animal (a juvenile) was also struck but survived. Betsy the giraffe was killed by lightning at Walt Disney World in Florida in 2003 (in front of lots of witnesses).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A juvenile giraffe at Louisiana’s Global Wildlife Center, named Dusty, was killed after lightning struck a nearby tree. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a study done at one of the game parks here in South Africa regarding the susceptibility of giraffes to lightning. It was found that a lot of the deaths attributed to lightning were actually caused by snake bites , Black Mamba's hunt birds in tree tops and the giraffes get fatal bites because they browse in the same  area. I live a few kilometers from the lion park mentioned and it has a very high strike rate because of the terrain layout and elevation. Johannesburg has one of the highest lightning strike rates in the world generally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People will talk all day about biochemistry and whatnot, but I'm an electrical engineer and I can tell you that they are struck by lightning more solely because they are the shortest path to ground.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually Reindeer heards in Russia get nuked by lighting more often than any other animal on earth.  Due to them grazing or traveling in a tight pack on the open Plains,  a single strike has killed over 1500 reindeer in Russia, with a similar event in Norway I believe it was killed around 1000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
