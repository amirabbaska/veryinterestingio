		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2015.00046/full" target="_blank">This article provides a good analysis of factors contributing to tree longevity</a> (a lot of it comes down to location, location, location), but doesn't address the larger question you're going for which is why certain trees have the <em>capacity</em> for a long lifespan.</p>
<p>&quot;Why&quot; isn't always a useful question in biology, or even possible to answer.  Often &quot;how&quot; is more relevant and easier to answer.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that not all trees have the capacity for a long lifespan, some species don't really appear to have a biological limit on their lifespan while others most definitely do have natural limits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.conifers.org/topics/longevity.htm" target="_blank">This transcript from a talk on the biological basis for conifer longevity</a> gets more to the point of your central question.</p>
<p><strong>TL/DR</strong> <em>that applying animal biological models and understanding to trees isn't an good way of thinking about them.  That very little of the tree is actually alive, and that, in some ways, a tree is a more like a colony than an individual organism (think coral as a loose analogy).  Some tree species appear to have a better or more robust DNA repair mechanism than others.</em></p>
<p>Some key points in the latter article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, there is no continuity of germ plasm. Many plant cells have the ability to create a new plant – a fact that we use all the time when we propagate plants from cuttings. In general, new growth occurs from undifferentiated cells in the meristem tissues, which occur in the cambium as shown here, or at growing tips of stems or roots.</p>
<p>Second, plants are modular, capable of an indeterminate number of leaves, or stems, or roots, in response to environmental changes. To a large degree these modules are independent of each other: most of the time the death of a leaf, or stem, or root does not have awful consequences for the rest of the plant. Think of the difference between cutting a limb off an animal and cutting one off a tree. To some degree, trees can be thought of as colonial organisms. How old is a colony?</p>
<p>The colony analogy is revealed in another way: trees basically consist of a dead woody core of heartwood that serves to provide structure for a veneer of living tissue. Only the veneer is alive, but when we speak of a tree being old, we usually mean that it has an old woody core.</p>
<p>One consequence of this modular and colonial growth strategy is that our perception of a tree as an individual is illogical; it is another instance of zoocentrism. To the tree, an individual woody structure is only important insofar as it provides a competitive advantage by providing an extensive root system to gather nutrients and water, or height growth that allows greater access to sunlight. If circumstance allow, the colony can easily appear as many individuals. For example, there are examples of yew trees that are thought of as being over 1000 years old because a yew tree has been growing in the same place for 1000 years; yet there may be several distinct stems, each of which has no living cell over 100 years old, and there may be no remnant of wood that is over 500 years old. How old is that tree? It depends on what you call age.</p>
<p>Telomeres are structures at the ends of the chromosome that play a critical role in cell division. Organisms with longer telomeres can sustain more cycles of cell division, and organisms with higher activity of the enzyme telomerase can better repair shortened telomeres.</p>
<p><em>Pinus longaeva</em> has significantly longer telomeres and higher telomere activity than more short-lived pine species (<em>P. taeda</em>, <em>P. palustris</em>, <em>P. resinosa</em>). Watson and Riha (2010) note that “the rate of molecular evolution in trees and shrubs with long generation times is slower when compared to related herbaceous plants with shorter generation times ... One explanation for this observation is that plant meristematic cells possess robust DNA repair and genome maintenance mechanism.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a bunch more in that transcript that's worth reading, but those paragraphs get to the heart of your question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their evolutionary niche is in being large and durable. They're the biggest things in the forest, so they get to hog all the sunlight they want. It takes a long time for trees to grow to be so big and tough, so they need to make use of it by living long enough to produce tons of seeds.</p>
<p>Trees are most vulnerable as saplings. If they don't get eaten or trampled when they're young, they don't have much to worry about for a long time. A strong, healthy tree is quite tough to take down by anything found in nature. A long life span allows the tree to produce many seeds and maximize its chances at reproduction.</p>
<p>Insects are on the other end of the spectrum. They're small, not terribly durable, and are often food for tons of other animals. Insects also tend to have quite short lives, but that's fine since their strategy is to reproduce like crazy and survive through sheer numbers. It doesn't matter if a million ants die if there are billions more ready to replace them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three reasons. Symbiosis, adaptation, and favoring reproductive success. </p>
<p>In evolutionary biology, adaptations are often acquired by modifying existing structures to accomplish new tasks. </p>
<p>Symbiotic relationships have developed among plants and bacteria, fungi, insects, and these relationships are usually undisturbed unless there is an interfering force.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of trees: gymnosperms (any woody plant that doesn't have a flower) and angiosperms (any flowering plant).  Trees can reproduce asexually by budding (their cells are totipotent, and so one &quot;cut&quot; of a tree can grow into a whole organism).
Pine trees have both male cones and female cones.  They typically try to get their pollen from the male cones into the female cones of other trees (to increase genetic diversity in the population), which produces viable seeds.
Flowers (angiosperms) have both male and female parts.  Again, they typically try to get their pollen to other trees (though sometimes they do self-pollination).
Common means of getting pollination to other trees include: wind, insects (bees or butterflies), birds, or bats. Relatively speaking, these take a long time compared to organisms like humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EIL5 why the earth itself isn't considered a living organism. </p>
<p>But to actually answer the question, I'd point out the lack of any significant predation (aside from humanity) and risky lifestyles.  In an ideal environment, with proper intake and maintenance, I'm curious where humanity might actually cap.  The whole telomere issue, and the fact that we can actually lengthen them.  Interesting times.</p>
<p>Then you also have to account for some species that effectively just keep getting older (and larger) until they're actually killed off.  There are sharks I believe we've aged at about 400 years if not more - just imagine the ones we haven't seen/dated.. trees might not be quite so unique as we think in this regard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
