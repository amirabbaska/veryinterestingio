It will not become harmful to consume, but freezing does not stop chemical reactions like oxidation - which when coupled with dehydration from the freezer will cause freezer burn. Freezer burn occurs at different times depending on the food and whether or not you have a freezer with defrost cycles. You can eat freezer burned food though it may not have the texture you want or the taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food exec here. I work for a group of frozen food processors producing roughly a billion lbs of frozen fruits and vegetables annually. I oversee accounting &amp; finance, so I'm not the final word, but can speak to what happens from a practical perspective.</p>
<p>After the frozen commodity is processed it goes in an industrial freezer and is stored between about -5° to 10° F.  It has about a two year &quot;life&quot; before expiration, but the expiration date isn't end of life. We frequently rework product up to 4-5 years old. At that point, if the product hasn't found a home, it's donated or sometimes tossed, but only if it's in bad shape. I've seen product as old as 5 years used &amp; sold, but not much beyond that. It's expensive to store so if we really focus on getting everything in and out within a year but for various reasons that doesn't always happen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best example I could find of people eating long frozen food was of <a href="http://www.theoldfoodie.com/2006/04/frozen-for-30000-years.html" target="_blank">&quot;Blue babe&quot;</a>, a frozen bison from 30,000 years ago. So presumably under laboratory conditions we could freeze something and have it be edible hundreds of thousands if not millions of years later. </p>
<p>&quot;Indefinitely&quot; is harder to answer, though if I had to guess I'd say that unless you froze it to absolute zero, reactions will still be happening at a slow but measurable rate and eventually it would deteriorate past edibility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know for certain that researchers in argentinian bases in antarctica usually eat deep frozen food that has been frozen for at least a year or two past their expiration date.</p>
<p>A close friend who went there many times told me that he ate meat and sweets that were two years past their expiration date. I was very  worried when he told me that. But then he said &quot;the mean temperature here is 0°C or lower,it's as if the food is perpetually in a freezer&quot;. </p>
<p>I suppose that makes sense after all.  As far as he knows there have been no food poisoning incidents in antarctica bases caused by eating expired deep frozen food. </p>
<p>Sorry for the bad english,not my first language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yes.  If you store biological samples below the glass transition temperature of water, all biological activity effectively stops.  This is why cells, including human semen and eggs, and simple tissues are stored at cryogenic temperatures in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Practically, the limit can be decades.  Quantum processes are not thermodynamically driven, so they happen regardless of the temperature of the sample.  This means that eventually, the sample will no longer be biologically viable, which means you probably can't eat it without getting food poisoning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
