		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chances are they dont output 2000 lumens. It's just grossly exaggerated. I wouldn't trust the ratings of those no name brand lights. </p>
<p>There are three ways to report total light output for flashlights:</p>
<p>1) Emitter lumens, which meaures light emitted straight from the light source. This gives you the highest number.</p>
<p>2) OTF or out the front. This is measured after the reflector/lens. There are some losses through each interface but it is a more realistic number.</p>
<p>3) ANSI lumens. The key thing is that you measure output after being powered on for at least 30 seconds to reach a steady operating state. This gives you the lowest number, but is the best way to determine real world light output.</p>
<p>Most reputable flashlight companies report OTF or ANSI lumens and they will typically specify it.</p>
<p>The most accurate way to measure lumens is in an integrating sphere.</p>
<p>Edit: I did not expect this to blow up. And cue the experts that know more than I do. While i do have a healthy flashlight collection, and worked at a lighting company for a short time, I've been out of the game for a while. I tried to distill the information in a digestible way. </p>
<p>Edit 2: apparently i can't word gud either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I can answer one of these for once! I design LED optics for a living, and I've worked with these flashlight companies directly. The lumen value being advertised is the dead-center peak value of lumens, after the light has exited the aperture of the lens in the fixture. This is by and large a sales pitch. It's not entirely a valuable factor. So the reason that cheap flashlights have that output is the LED is one from the cheaper LED producers (many in China) who dump out as much power as possible. These LEDs don't have the significant lifetimes that LEDs from Cree or Nichia or Bridgelux will have, and honestly for a flashlight they don't need it. It's not a streetlight that won't see another technician for years, it's a dinky little flashlight that you (the customer &quot;you&quot;) will probably lose before the effectiveness of the LED drops and the lens clouds up, so the flashlight company is only paying for LEDs that will last just a bit longer than the average customer will go before buying a replacement light. If in fact a light is advertising LEDs from a specific company, then they probably recognize that company as value-added to the sale with name-brand recognition.</p>
<p>I will also mention, LED technology is a rapidly growing field, and every year they get closer to replicating sunlight, which would be the ultimate goal. For a while, the LED packages were getting more efficient for a longer life. Then, with best practices spreading and competition developing, prices for older LEDs began to drop. Now, they are working towards larger LES (light emitting surfaces) so as to pack out as much light as possible from the smallest footprint. A single &quot;eggdrop&quot; COB LED can produce more light in a smaller area than the equivalent group of smaller LEDs which require spacing and circuitry. So don't be surprised if you pop out the lens of a larger flashlight and only see one single huge light source instead of the multiple little ones they use now.</p>
<p>Any more questions I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>Oh one more thing. The lumen number they come up with is probably the summation of the lumen output of each individual LED, running at a specific amperage. You can visit a website like Cree's and take a look at the data sheets yourself!</p>
<p>Edit: oh wow, hello everyone and thanks. I'll try to answer what I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>standardized lumen measurement is done by measuring amount of light output using sophisticated detection hardware.</p>
<p>the source of most high power flashlights nowadays are all LED's made by the same manufacturer Cree.    that doesn't mean someone can't copy CREE's chip and make it dirt cheap.   alot of Chinese manufacturers knockoff CREE's designs or even label theirs CREE when they're not.   and those unreputable vendors will also label their light 2000lumens when they're not.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main unit companies like to use to give a healthy dose of marketing onto flashlight output is the Candlepower or Candela unit. </p>
<p>You'll see these little handheld flashlights that allege to give out a million candle power, which they probably do, but here's the thing. </p>
<p>Candlepower is a measurement in a specific direction at a particular distance. So if you measure closely enough (like say a meter away) and focus the beam tightly enough, you'll get a decent value from even a fairly naff light source. </p>
<p>Measure a more powerful light source from further away, like say a lighthouse from a ship, and you might get the same reading in candle power, and that reading will get bigger the closer you get, but obviously a lighthouse is a way more powerful light source than a handheld flashlight. </p>
<p>Lumens is the more sensible method. </p>
<p>The way that's done is like this. </p>
<p>Imagine a sphere with a light source in the centre that sends its light in every direction. The measurement from the light source to the surface of the sphere (the radius) is a certain measurement in, inches, meters, whatever. Whatever that measurement is, if you draw a square in the surface of the sphere that has the same length sides as that radius, you get an area of surface called one unit solid angle, otherwise known as a <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/attachments/isqrr-gif.164078/" target="_blank">'Steradian'</a>.</p>
<p>If you imagine as the sphere gets bigger, the Steradian also gets bigger, so as you get further away, the light is measured from a larger area. So the value stays the same. </p>
<p>That's not to say it (the lumens value) can't be increased with a better focussed lens, but at least measuring that way the value will stay the same no matter what distance you measure it at. The same can't be said for candela. </p>
<p>So dishonest companies will get a light, focus the hell out of it and then say you get a million candle power out of it, or whatever, when the actual lumens value out of it wouldn't be all that impressive.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
