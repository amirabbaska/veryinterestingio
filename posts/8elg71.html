		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Mass warps spacetime. That's Einstein's theory of general relativity. But that's not all. <em>Any</em> energy warps spacetime. Remember, E=mc^2 - mass and energy are basically the same thing, packaged different ways. </p>
<p>This means something weird. For example, suppose you had two identical planets - each with the exact same numbers of atoms arranged the same way. If one was hotter, that means it has a greater total energy, so it would warp spacetime more strongly, effectively giving it stronger gravity than it's colder twin.</p>
<p>But this also means that electromagnetic waves, because they carry energy, warp spacetime. Light carries a very tiny amount of energy compared to any massive object so the effect is basically negligible, but it's still very real. In fact, if you put enough light in one spot, you can warp space enough to make a black hole! This black hole will be completely indistinguishable from one formed from matter, because black holes don't present any 'memory' of what they were made from. </p>
<p>This black-hole-made-of-light actually has a fun name. It's called a [kugelblitz](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics%29" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics%29</a>) (that's German for Ball Lightning)!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>The warping of space-time is gravity.</em>  Gravity doesn't just warp space, it is that the warping of space time by momentum and energy causes gravitation.  So everything that contributes to energy or momentum can cause the warping of space-time.</p>
<p>The hard part with the question is that an electromagnetic wave does not have an absolute amount of energy or momentum.  It is only defined for each individual observer.  This means that a beam of electromagnetic waves can never cause a black hole, as that would require a frame independent amount of concentrated mass/energy.  So electromagnetic waves do not cause warps in space time the way mass would, as mass is Lorenz invariant. ( If something is Lorenz invariant means that every observer agrees on some measurement, no matter their retaliative velocity. )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
