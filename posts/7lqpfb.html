		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both visual and audio information is immediately crossed on secondary neurons in the brain. In the brain stem for hearing, and in the optic chiasm for vision. So immediately the information is spread to both cerebral hemispheres, and shouldnâ€™t be processed any different with one-sided input than both. </p>
<p>There are portions of the brain, however, that relate to specific visual fields. These neurons would be repurposed in an individual with vision loss. </p>
<p>For someone with one-sided hearing loss, they would lose the ability to determine location of sounds, since the brain uses the minuscule time difference between the sound arriving in each ear to determine location. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, eyes aren't simply, directly connected, to opposite hemispheres of the rear of our brain, the occipital lobe. </p>
<p>In fact, information from each half of our eyes go to opposite sides of the occipital lobe... Here's a diagram that helps explain what I mean.</p>
<p><a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/304/eyes1.gif" target="_blank">http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/304/eyes1.gif</a></p>
<p>Notice how its wired up. </p>
<p>So when neurologists investigate how sight works, they may use a screen that blocks one half of the visual field of both eyes, left and left or right and right, thus blocking imagery going to one half of the occipital lobe.</p>
<p>So, you'd have to read with one half of an eye or half of both eyes to investigate differences in visual processing. As far as I know here's no difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A related question.</p>
<p>You're in an environment with moderate diffuse ambient noise.  60 Db measured at right ear and left ear.  You're wearing headphones.  Human speech stream is delivered to left ear only at a SPL that is barely intelligible.  Now deliver the same speech at the same SPL to both the left and right ear.  Does it become more easily intelligible?  Why or why not?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the commenters understood the question being asked. I've wondered the same. I once read about a person who had their brain hemispheres separated and also wore an eye patch for lazy eye while they learned to read. As the story goes, when the opposite eye was occluded the person could not recognize the words to read.</p>
<p>I think in a normal brain there is enough communication between the hemispheres that there is no difference in perception. This assumption is based on absolutely no research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I think there may be a difference.. in the past I've sat on a train looking at passing lone trees on a field boundary with many branches but few if any leaves - such that from my moving perspective, the trees are rotating. If I close one eye then I perceive the tree as a flat but moving image, while with the other eye closed, my brain perceives the rotating 3d model. Would be interested to hear if others experience the same!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
