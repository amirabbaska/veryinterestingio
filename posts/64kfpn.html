They have pretty good stats on how many people, on average, won't show, so they know how many to overbook each flight. An empty seat is lost money.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are fewer no-shows, and that's an overbook. They do have to compensate people for bumping them from the flight, but that's cheaper than having unsold seats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's intentional. If someone doesn't show for a flight or cancels, that's money the airline doesn't make on that flight.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large planes use almost the same amount of fuel whether they're half empty or packed, and airline companies know this.</p>
<p>They also know from experience that some small percentage of booked passengers don't show up.</p>
<p>They maximize profit margins (the margins on cheap seats are razor thin) by booking 102 seats on a 100 seat plane and assuming that at least two aren't gonna show.</p>
<p>Usually they're right, but occasionally all 102 people show up and someone's waiting for the next plane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they know that some people will not show up for the flight, so it is prudent to overbook to make sure they fill the flight, and if their statistics betray them, they will bump them to a later flight for a few hundred bucks.</p>
<p>cheaper to pay to bump people on occassion than to fly with 10 empty seats almost every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can, which means operating each flight as close to 100% full as possible.</p>
<p>Imagine you're operating an airline. Most of the time, a few people don't show up for their flight. So you start selling a few extra tickets for each flight. If everyone shows up, you don't have seats for them all. But everyone showing up is very unlikely.</p>
<p>Actual airlines use statistics to determine how many no-shows are likely to happen on each flight. They factor in everything, such as where the flight is to and from, age of the passenger, gender of the passenger, if they're flying with anyone else, the time of the flight, the weather that day, and a <em>ton</em> of other factors. With all of this information, they can get a <em>very</em> good estimate of how many people won't show up for a particular flight. So they then go ahead and sell more tickets for that flight, based on their estimate.</p>
<p>Most of the time, there's no issue. Everyone who shows up gets to fly. But some of the time, there is an issue, because more people than expected showed up for the flight. In these cases, airlines typically offer incentives for travelers to voluntarily give up their seat on the flight, and although this costs the airline some money, the extra money they make by overbooking to get every flight as full as possible more than offsets this cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
