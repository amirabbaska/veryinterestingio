<p>the hunt for earth like planets is going to require very sensitive devices. the   <a href="http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/instrumentation/expres.php" target="_blank">EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES)</a> at the Discovery channel Telescope owned by Lowell Observatory is expected to detect velocity changes in a star due to planets in orbit around it sensitive enough to  detect a planet like earth. it can detect velocities down to 20cm/s in stellar motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Location matters more than anyone seems to care. To observe a planet with the transit method, you need to be at the perfect angle to watch it pass in front of the sun. It will dim a little. This usually works for detecting so called Hot-Jupiters, plants bigger than Jupiter very close to their sun. Most exoplanets are found by observing the orbit of the sun, or it's  'wobble'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
