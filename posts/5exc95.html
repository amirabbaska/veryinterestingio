		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, the primary colours of paint are cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMYK). These colours are the exact opposite (complimentary) colours of red (opposite cyan), blue (opposite yellow), and green (opposite <del>green</del> magenta). </p>
<p>RGB are the real three colours of light that our cones can react to. Short, medium, and long cones react to blue, green, and red light respectively. Anything in between these three colours will activate the different cones to different degrees, and our brain will determine the colour we see based on the combination of reactions.</p>
<p>The idea behind CMY(K) is that you're absorbing the colours away from white light, hence reduction. Their combinations will result in the opposite effect of adding real colours of light. Combining cyan and magenta will provide a blue colour, because cyan absorbs all red, and magenta absorbs all green, leaving behind blue light being reflected. This only holds true if you're viewing the colours under white light however. If you looked at it under yellow light, then the colour you would see off a cyan/magenta ink mixture will be black, as there is no blue component reflected.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're trying this with acrylics, the colour might look muddled because of an aspect of paint called chroma. Generally, the more colours you mix, the more hue/colour you would lose, and it is a fundamental idea behind paint mixing.</p>
<p>Your idea of red, yellow, blue primary colours is really just an approximation of cyan (close to blue), magenta (close to red) and yellow, but they serve their purpose in reaching many hues on the colour scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Red, blue and yellow are the reductive primaries; they are based on absorption of light.  Red, green and blue are the actual primary colours and they are technically the only colours you can see.  Your eyes have cones for each of the primaries (red, green blue) from which all colours that you see are formed.  Reductive colours are formed by the substance absorbing all the light except the colour you see (which is reflected).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work printing, so I know a bit about color.</p>
<p>There's two ways of &quot;making color&quot; one way is making light refract on a surface with such color, thus emmiting only the wave length you'll see as that certain color and the other way is directly emmiting that certain colors.</p>
<p>If you want to refract light (printed stuff/ink), you will use C, M, Y and K to produce &quot;most&quot; of the existing colors. (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key - Black)</p>
<p>If you want to emit light (think of monitors, leds/screens) you will use R, G and B colors.</p>
<p>There's a thing called space color and can be explained as the range of color a material can reproduce/refract or the range of colors a human being (or an animal, I guess) can perceive or &quot;see&quot;.</p>
<p>So, imagine a human has 100% of color perception. With RGB combinations, you can reproduce, let's say 90% of  that color range, with CMYK, you can reproduce maybe 80% of the color range.</p>
<p>In printing, we have the pantone specification, which are single colors made from special chemicals and are unique, and not achievable by mixing C, M, Y and K colors. This colors are the ones you see on corporate logos sometimes and some other like electric and gold/silver colors.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, we use those colors on the screens because that's the best we can come up with, technologically, to reproduce the biggest part of the perceivable color space. As an example, here's a reddit post about why getting blue laser was such a breakthrough: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ijwpn/why_was_it_much_harder_to_develop_blue_leds_than/?st=ivzcne4z&sh=7c84fffa" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ijwpn/why_was_it_much_harder_to_develop_blue_leds_than/?st=ivzcne4z&sh=7c84fffa</a> - TL,DR: Because those color are made with different compounds, but sometimes, maybe those compounds do not get along with each other. I guess RGB is the best we can do &quot;effortlessly&quot; on screens and same with CMYK on surfaces, since making these colors is &quot;inexpensive&quot; compared to maybe, other ways we could find through expensive research, perhaps using more costly materials than the ones used for crafting the CMYK base.</p>
<p>I hope I explained myself well enough, I'm not english native :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some very good answers already but here's how I understood it in school. When you mix the 3 primary colours of paint (cyan, yellow, magenta) you are 'adding' their effects, which would do this. The cyan strips all the light away except cyan, hence how we see that colour. The yellow would then strip any remaining light away that wasn't yellow, and finally magenta would strip away the light that wasn't magenta. This would result in black. Think when you were a child and mixed lots of paints, you almost always ended with black or brown.</p>
<p>Light however does the opposite, instead of stripping the colours away, light adds the colours, so if you add the three primary colours of light (red, blue, green) you would end with white. </p>
<p>I've probably butchered this but hopefully you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your computer monitor when off is naturally black, in order to display it emits light in the form of a beam (electron gun, led etc) so it has to use an additive scheme, the rgb scheme is additive, it could in theory use a reflective scheme but I imagine it would be complex and expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
