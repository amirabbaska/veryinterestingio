		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can see galaxies and (with the Hubble telescope) see the speed at which they rotate.  We can also calculate how much the stars in those galaxies mass.  The problem is, that much matter, spinning at those speeds, would fly apart.  Even adding in planets, dust, and black holes, there still isn't enough matter in galaxies to hold them together.  Not even nearly enough.  There shouldn't even be galaxies anymore, just scattered stars.  But there <em>are</em> still galaxies, so <em>something</em> we can't see must hold them together.  </p>
<p>The leading contender for that <em>something</em> is matter that doesn't interact with normal matter or energy but does create gravity like normal matter.  We call that hypothetical <em>something</em> dark matter, and we're trying to figure out what it is.  </p>
<p>From observing the movements of galaxies and the apparent mass they contain, we can approximate how much gravity would hold them together, and that gives us the amount of dark matter.</p>
<p>Dark energy comes from a different observation about the universe. There is a type of supernova called 1A, which is an exploding white dwarf star.  Since white dwarfs explode at a certain mass, the explosions are always about the same, and each 1A supernova is pretty much the same brightness and color spectrum as the next.  </p>
<p>Since they're the same brightness, we can calculate how far away they are by how faint they appear.  Since they're the same color, we can calculate how fast they're moving away from us - the faster a star moves away from us, the redder it appears- we call that its <em>redshift</em>.  (Although, regardless of the speed or direction its source is moving, light always moves at the same speed, movement toward us compresses the light's wavelength, making the light appear bluer, while movement away stretches that wavelength, making it appear redder.)</p>
<p>If the universe started all together and then moved apart at a constant rate, then we would expect the redshift - how fast it's moving away - to be the same for nearby galaxies as well as distant ones. But fainter (more distant) 1A supernovae aren't red enough.  Since we're seeing those distant ones as they were when the universe was very young, that tells us the universe was expanding at a slower rate back then.  And the further back in time we look, the slower expansion was at that time.</p>
<p>So the universe's expansion has been speeding up.  But <em>something</em> must be speeding it up.  What?  Nothing we can detect.  Since speeding up as we know it is always caused by energy, we call this undetectable something dark energy.</p>
<p>Calculating how much the expansion has accelerated, and how much energy it would take to do that to all those galaxies, gives us an approximation of the amount of dark energy. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR: We get the amount of dark matter from how much extra gravity it would take to keep galaxies from flying apart.  We get the amount of dark energy from how much energy it would take to accelerate the expansion of the universe at the rate we see it happening.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two very different components to this answer. Before I get into it, let's define the everyday stuff you encounter, every molecule, atom, quark, etc. we know about is called baryonic matter. Now in astrophysics, it's not bad to assume all baryonic matter is hydrogen, which burns in stars. Thus, baryonic matter is bright and we can see it in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>Now part 1 is the dark matter to baryonic matter ratio. Vera Rubin discovered this wild method of measuring the mass of galaxies via their rotational rates. Essentially, based on the speed at certain distances from the core, you can calculate where the mass in concentrated. We expected the mass to decrease as you get further from a galactic core because that is how the light drops off which is consistent with our explanations of baryonic matter. However, we find that there is more mass further out than we expected, meaning there is matter we cannot see that must be there. Because it doesn't interact with light, it must be dark. We're making a lot of progress in identifying dark matter, but it's very weird to think about.</p>
<p>Next we need to talk about the ratio of dark energy to everything else. I'm not a cosmologist, so I don't know much about this, but essentially the universe is expanding. We know this thanks to Hubble and everything we can see confirms it. However, we recently discovered that the universe is now expanding faster than it used to, ie. The universe is accelerating. Now this makes no sense because the expansion of the universe is defined as the expansion of space between things, so in order for this to be accelerating, something must exist intrinsically inside space to cause an acceleration. Energy is what you call something that causes expansion, so it must be energy. We can quantify it because we know how the universe is expanding, but we know almost nothing about what this thing really is.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that dark energy could also be considered dark mass because of Einstein's mass energy equivalence of E=mc^2. But that being said, this is a super nebulous explanation of a super nebulous argument that physics struggles to explain.</p>
<p>So even if we can get a good ratio of these things, we aren't very close to understanding them. Another misconception is that dark matter and dark energy are related. This is actually completely false. They have very different properties with almost no overlap and they're only dark because we've never seen them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to make some general comments to reply to a whole host of lower-rated comments that are dominating the discussion down here below the actual answers.</p>
<p>&quot;Dark matter&quot; really literally does mean <em>matter</em> that is <em>dark.</em> It is not simply a placeholder name or a vague metaphor. It could actually be as simple as huge masses of unassociated planet- or star- like objects drifting out there in the void between galaxies where it's <em>literally too dark</em> to see them. This (MACHOs) is a somewhat unlikely theory, but can't be ruled out. The leading theory (WIMPs) is that much of the substance of the universe is taken up in particles that bear mass, and so interact gravitationally with baryonic matter, but are electromagnetically inert. Many of you will be aware that literally trillions of <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~larson/Webpage/neutrinos.html" target="_blank">neutrinos</a> pass through each of our bodies every second; these theoretical WIMPs would be very much like neutrinos, except slower moving so that they can hang around in clumps around galaxies instead of flying along out of all but the very strongest gravity wells. (One of the strongest candidate theoretical particles for dark matter is actually called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralino" target="_blank">neutralino.</a>)</p>
<p>There is this ongoing meme that &quot;dark matter&quot; is just a modern <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Dormitive+virtue" target="_blank"><em>virtus dormitiva,</em></a> an impressive but vacuous label pasted over a lack of understanding. <strong>This is false.</strong> We have specific theoretical and observational reasons to believe that dark matter <em>is matter that is dark,</em> not some quirk of gravitational law:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our current laws of gravity are not just empirically curve-fitted to match observations. They &quot;fall out&quot; inevitably once certain very high-level and abstract assumptions about the nature of space-time are made. No-one has proposed any alternative theory that matches observations at least as well as Einsteinian general relativity while also having this property of &quot;looking like&quot; a legitimate fundamental theory. They're all just kludges. We seem far more entitled to add &quot;kludges&quot; to our inherently limited and incomplete telescopic observations of that portion of the universe which is visible to us in the electromagnetic spectrum than we do to add kludges to fundamental, abstract physical laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have at least some direct observational evidence that refutes non-dark-matter explanations of the anomaly in galaxy rotation rates. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster#Significance_to_dark_matter" target="_blank">Bullet Cluster</a> is a galactic collision that has caused stars and galaxies to spatter out in all directions in a pattern that looks <em>exactly</em> as if the galaxies' dark matter halos are really there and interacting gravitationally, and that seems to be <em>impossible</em> to explain without invoking such halos of dark matter. Since the 2006 Bullet Cluster observations there have been several other similar collisions observed. Admittedly, the interpretation of these observations is complex, and diehard opponents of the dark matter theory have attempted to poke holes in them. You really need to be an actual cosmologist to judge the resulting debates independently, but it is clear that almost everyone in the field thinks they really do refute non-dark-matter theories.</p>
</li>
<li>We don't have to do any kind of violence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">standard model of particle physics</a> to make room for WIMPs. There are actually several different places in the model where we can plausibly fit candidate particles that have the necessary properties to be dark matter. It is true that the experimentalists have started to eliminate some of these candidates, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">one that seemed almost &quot;miraculously&quot; plausible,</a> but there is still a lot of room in the model. So we are really not postulating anything crazy with dark matter.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know this, because we can calculate, estimate really, the mass/energy of the universe, or at least parts of space. We also can determine mass/energy of things we can see. These two number are nowhere near each other.
For example. You have a weightless piggy bank. You look into the piggy bank, and you can see 3 quarters and a dime. You weigh this piggy bank, and it weighs 35 pounds. You logically determine that under no circumstances can 4 coins weigh that much. No amount of error or scale calibration can cause that much error. Therefore, you determine that there is something else in the piggy bank you can't see. This is dark matter. We can measure its impact on the world. I.E. it's weight in the piggybank, but can't see it or directly measure it. The calculations that arrive at the exact percentages are guesses. Good ones mind you, but estimates none the less. Going back to the piggy bank example, it weighs 35 pounds, and the coins (for simplicities sale) weigh a pound. We can determine that the dark matter makes up 34 pounds of our piggy bank, or %97. And the matter, or  coins, make up %3. The reason accuracy is impeded is because we can't measure the mass of the coins exactly, but we know for sure there is a MASSIVE discrepancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see anybody mention the Friedmann Equations yet. That's where the numbers really come from.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations</a></p>
<p>They follow from Einstein's field equations, which I don't know nearly well enough to simplify down to layman's terms. </p>
<p>The Friedmann Equations are basically &quot;equations of state&quot; for the universe, which means that it describes the relationship between different parameters. You know how the ideal gas law is pV=nRT? That's an equation of state. The Friedmann Equations are like that, but a bit more complex. </p>
<p>Plugging our observations into the Friedmann Equations is what gives us the percentages of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter that you mention. </p>
<p>(This, by the way, is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model" target="_blank">Lambda-CDM model</a>, which is the most accepted cosmological model. The main assumption is that Einstein's equations for gravity are correct.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
