		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is <em>meant</em> by the claim depends a lot on who is saying it. Some people feel this has philosophical or scientific significance that others don’t agree with.</p>
<p>But the claim, on the surface, is true, or close to true.</p>
<p>A vast majority of genes are used to carry out basic cellular functions like generating power (converting glucose and oxygen to ATP), cell division to create new cells... even “specializations” like the creation of muscle fibers or electrochemical signaling proteins in nerve cells may be similar between all mammals, or even all vertebrates.</p>
<p>The remaining 1% can account for a huge amount of variation, though. This doesn’t mean humans aren’t “meaningfully” or significantly different from chimpanzees. All the similarity just means we share the basic biochemical structure of our bodies, and even methods of reproduction, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans also share like 95% dna with pufferfish. The way my Biopsychology professor explained it is: how much do we really have different? We have skin, 2 eyes, mouth, skin, the same organs (for example human liver and fish liver are different but they’re both livers, they both do the same thing.) our organs are made out of the same cells all our nerves communicate with with our brain in the same way. If you think about it the difference between a human and a chimp is like we’re bigger, less hairy, less muscular, and smarter. That’s not really a whole lot considering all the similarities we share. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most genes define the basic building blocks of life. Think of it being like bricks or two-by-fours in a house. A few genes describe how the pieces go together. Think of that being like the blueprints for a house.</p>
<p>So the lesson is, most forms of life are put together from the same fundamental building blocks. That's why most of their genes are the same. It's just how they fit the pieces together that's different. That's the small fraction of the genes that are different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the operational part of DNA is 4 nitrogen based nucleotides, called  adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The way this works is that for each &quot;rung&quot; on the DNA &quot;ladder&quot;, one side has one of the 4 nucleotides, and the other side has another one of the 4 nucleotides; A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C, so if you look down one side you can derive the other side.</p>
<p>The order that these are found in a strand of DNA tell an organism how to grow and what traits to develop.</p>
<p>When it comes to chimpanzees and humans, if you were to take a single complete genome sequence of a chimp and compare it to a single complete genome sequence of a human, you'd find that for every 100 nucleotides (on average), 99 of the nucleotides are the same (ie: same location on the same side, starting from the top of the sequence). This probably does not hold across all of the code; there are probably some sections where nothing is the same, and then other sections that are basically copy-pasted, but by and large it gets out to an overall 99% similarity.</p>
<p>Note: I'm not a biologist but this is how it was explained to me, so there may be some inaccuracies on some more technical aspects, but this is the general gist of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The structure and composition of complex organisms such as humans, chimpanzees, rabbits, birds, crocodiles, tulips, etc. are derived from the ordering of their DNA. This DNA is composed of four basic building blocks which are ordered in a chain which ultimately is used to build the organisms.</p>
<p>Chimpanzees have 99% of their DNA being identical to that of humans. The same building blocks in the same places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
