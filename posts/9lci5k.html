		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you see those very detailed pictures of nebulae or galaxies that are very distant, you have to keep in mind that they are very large: most nebula are larger than entire star systems, and galaxies can hold hundreds of billions of star systems. There's also the matter of brightness: nebulae and galaxies generally produce a lot of light (or reflect it, for some nebulae), while planets don't produce light and may only reflect a small amount.</p>
<p>Consider this as an analogy: imagine looking outside a window, towards the horizon. Seeing a building in the distance can be pretty easy, especially if it's a very big building. But reading the text in a book down just a little ways the street is probably impossible. The building is much bigger than the book, even if it is further away. Now, try doing the same thing at night: if the building has lights on you can see it very easily, but unless the book is sitting right under a street light you won't see the book, much less be able to read it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to nebulae, planets are very very very very very small. You can see a mountain that is 1 kilometre away from you much clearer than you can see a grain of sand that is 1 metre away.</p>
<p>Edit: as several people have mentioned, planets don't emit any light of their own, this makes it extremely difficult to see planets when they're being drowned out by the light of their parent stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider the Helix Nebula, its the closest one to Earth, we have fantastic pictures of it, and its only 700 light years away. Its 5.75 light years in diameter. </p>
<p>Compare that to the solar system, which it measured from Neptune to the sun, has a diameter of only 0.0012 light years across. That's like the difference between a mountain and a housefly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
