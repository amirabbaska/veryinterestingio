		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put : we measure the age when half the stars formed. Heres is how it works. </p>
<p>First we get a spectrum for the galaxy. Then, by using models of how stars form and how they age, we get a try and figure out the age of each star in the galaxy. In other words how many stars born in what sequence would produce the light we see. This gives us a histogram of stellar ages, or the rate at which the galaxy was forming  stars. We then order the stars by age from oldest to youngest and figure out the point at which half the stars were born. This is called the “stellar half mass age” and is a proxy for how old the galaxy is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measured by distance from us. Further the galaxy, younger it is. But why? Because it's related to the speed of light and because time is not absolute universally. If you think in an absolute time, most galaxies are more or less about 13 billion years old, right after the big bang event. It doesn't take 12 billion years for a galaxy to form, yet in reality, we have observed galaxies less than a billion year old.  Their relative age is exactly the duration that their light has reached Earth. If its light has reached Earth for 500 million years, the galaxy's age to us is 500 million year old. Know that, their age is not 500 million years old everywhere universally. The galaxies next to that 500m yold galaxy will see its age around 13 billion years. To them, our galaxy is 500 million years old. They're seeing our galaxy when it's that young. We're living in 12 billion years into their future, if thinking in absolute time.</p>
<p>The reason we've settled with this relativistic time/age is because we've settled that nothing can travel faster light. A 13 billion years old galaxy over there doesn't mean anything to us, because we can never reach it instantly.</p>
<p>Note that the galaxy age is different from its distance to Earth because just recently, we've come to conclusion that the universe is expanding. A galaxy can be 16 billion light years away from us even if the age of the universe is just under 13.772 billion light years.</p>
<p>Every year, we are having new younger and dimmer galaxies reaching Earth. We need better telescope to continue observing these new galaxies. Young galaxies are extremely dim that it can take months to take photo of them through long exposure photography, that means having the telescope looking at it and gathering its light for weeks and months to take that one photo. Normally your phone camera needs to gather light for 20ms or less, depending how dark your room is. Ever wonder why ground-based telescopes have to rotate </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
