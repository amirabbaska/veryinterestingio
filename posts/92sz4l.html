		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taken from the book &quot;Recovering From Training&quot; by Drs. Israetel and Hoffman: </p>
<p><strong>Section 3: The Pathways of Fatigue</strong></p>
<p>As aforementioned, fatigue can be separated into acute fatigue, which dissipates within a single training session or very shortly thereafter, and cumulative fatigue which can take days, weeks or longer to resolve. For our current purposes, recovery from the latter type of fatigue (though not from the former) is critical, so we will go briefly over the acute pathways of fatigue and focus more heavily on potential pathways for its accumulation.</p>
<p>Acute Fatigue Pathways:</p>
<ul>
<li>⠂  ATP Depletion</li>
<li>⠂  Creatine Phosphate Depletion</li>
<li>⠂  Nervous System Disruption</li>
<li>⠂  Oxygen Depletion</li>
<li>⠂  Blood Sugar Depletion</li>
<li>⠂  Metabolite Summation<br />
<strong>ATP Depletion</strong><br />
Adenosine triphosphate (or ATP) is the transporter of chemical energy within cells and therefore the rate­limiting aspect of energy output. Insufficient ATP generates acute fatigue in high intensity exertions. The average muscle cell only stores enough ATP for about 1 second of maximum force production (explaining why plyometric movements are so depleting). Consequently, stored ATP is quickly exhausted during the first few seconds of exercise, forcing the body to regenerate ATP through the breakdown of other energy substrates.<br />
<strong>Creatine Phosphate Depletion</strong><br />
When ATP is broken down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate as energy is used in the muscles, creatine phosphate (CP) can rapidly replenish ATP by donating its phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). While this process doesn’t quite fully restore ATP levels, it comes close, and there is enough CP in the average skeletal muscle cell to power around 10 seconds of near­maximum muscle contractions. This is why 100 meter sprinters can run about the same speed toward the end of the race as they did about one quarter of the way through: not quite as fast as they did at the start, but pretty close.<br />
Creatine phosphate is depleted during high­intensity efforts, and needs several minutes to recover to complete or near­complete levels. This is the reason that taking a 1­-3 minute rests between sets in weight training is a good idea. CP is regenerated to its full capacity within about 5 minutes of rest, which makes it a valuable energy substrate during intermittent, high intensity efforts.<br />
<strong>Nervous System Disruption</strong><br />
It is generally accepted that decreased motor neuron output resulting from prolonged or intense exertion plays a role in fatigue generation, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Contributing factors may include negative feedback mechanisms via inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord, decreased or disorganized signaling from the motor cortex in the brain, and local</li>
</ul>
<p>11</p>
<p>neuronal firing issues (though these likely originate with biochemical changes in the muscle fibers that affect neuron signal propagation).</p>
<p>These acute nervous system effects curb performance within the session, but sufficient rest should restore them to normal states.</p>
<p><strong>Oxygen Depletion</strong></p>
<p>Oxygen consumption in the muscle tissue can get so extreme that it exceeds the rate at which the body can deliver fresh oxygen to that area. In exercise physiology this is termed the “Oxygen Deficit”, where the oxygen already present in the muscle tissue is metabolized rapidly during exercise, but the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems have not yet adjusted to the increased energy demand on the body. This creates a “deficit” or gradient of oxygen concentration between the muscle tissue and the bloodstream. Within a few minutes of rest, however, oxygen levels can be replenished and homeostasis restored.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Sugar Depletion</strong></p>
<p>When we consume carbohydrates, whether as complex carbs from bread and pasta or as simple sugars from candy or juice, they are broken down into simple glucose molecules and released into our bloodstream to be used or stored for later. If you train for long enough without eating, especially under low carbohydrate conditions, you can run short on blood sugar. Because the nervous system prefers blood glucose over any other kind of fuel, when this preferred energy source is low, physical performance levels will begin to predictably drop. The good news is that a simple carb shake can quickly remedy this. Unused blood glucose can be combined into huge polysaccharides composed of many glucose molecules, called glycogen and stored in the liver or muscles. The liver releases its stored glycogen to replenish blood glucose levels. Even if liver stores are totally depleted, a couple of high carbohydrate meals after training can fully restock this supply. When liver glycogen stores are full, they can provide adequate blood glucose to fuel the demands of hours of training. Muscles also store carbohydrate as glycogen, but use it as a local energy source within the muscle rather than releasing it into the bloodstream. Due to its location within active muscles in need of energy, muscle glycogen is used preferentially during exercise and is more rapidly depleted.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolite Summation</strong></p>
<p>Muscles use a variety of reactions to produce the energy needed for contraction and these processes come with the creation of byproducts called metabolites. These molecules, including hydrogen ions, CO2, inorganic phosphate, and lactate are not all innocent bystanders. The accumulation of high levels of metabolites can result in interference with neuromuscular signaling and the mechanisms of muscle contraction itself. Metabolites can also significantly lower local pH, which results in the familiar “burn” experienced during training. Luckily, most of these metabolites are cleared within seconds after training. The notion that lactic acid from a previous day’s training remains uncleared from the body for an extended period of time is a common misconception, as lactate concentrations typically return to resting conditions within a few hours after exercise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of this is the ATP replenishment, part of it is the creatine phosphate replenishment (which takes a touch longer to fill back up), and part of it is waste product disposal such as hydrogen ions from anaerobic energy pathways, etc. It also gives your cardiovascular system a moment to calm down and get a lead of tissue oxygenation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also consider oxygen debt. As you exercise you can't supply as much oxygen so you respire anaerobically and produce lactic acid. This causes pain and fatigue as it's poisonous and causes pain to muscles. When you rest the oxygen you take in is used to break lactic acid areobically and you feel less pain and gain more energy back </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
