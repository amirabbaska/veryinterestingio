		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I make fonts for a living. </p>
<p>TrueType and OpenType fonts are mostly the same thing.</p>
<p>There are two things that make them different:</p>
<p>TrueType fonts are drawn using Quadratic Outlines, which is a very formal way of drawing letters. OpenType fonts use Postscript Outlines which is a much easier way for designers to draw fonts.
You can't see the difference when looking at a font, but it's something a type designer has to think about when drawing the letters.</p>
<p>The other difference is how each font uses &quot;hinting&quot;. Hinting is special rules that tell the computer how to show the font on a computer screen. </p>
<p>TrueType has lots of rules about how it should look, and because of this, a hinted font will usually look better on a computer screen. PostScript has some simple rules and mostly lets the computer decide how it should look. </p>
<p>TrueType fonts can have a .ttf or .otf extension, and OpenType fonts can only have a .otf extension. </p>
<p>Most people can't see these little differences, so you can use either OpenType or TrueType fonts.
When you're working in a job that uses a lot of fonts you might need to use one format or the other. Graphic designers who work in print usually use OpenType fonts. Web designers usually use fonts that start out as TrueType fonts. And a lot of architects need to use TrueType fonts in their programs. </p>
<p>Last thing, kids: fonts take a lot of work to make and a lot of people work very hard to drawn new and interesting fonts. So please use your allowance to buy fonts and don't steal. </p>
<p>Adults: </p>
<ul>
<li>assuming OTF is CFF-OTF/Type 1 outlines, even though OTF is a wrapper around CFF or TTF outlines.</li>
<li>manual hinting is better than no hinting or autohinting.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to build on what others have said:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenType fonts can be used across operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.)</li>
<li>OpenType features allow for some very nifty substitution logic, I've used it to give the &quot;worn type&quot; look by randomly switching out up to seven versions of the same character. </li>
<li>OpenType fonts can come in CFF / Type 1 or TrueType flavors. The nature of the curves differs slightly, but more importantly, the former will have the .OTF extension, while the latter will have .TTF - it's still an OpenType font, though! The TrueType flavor seems to be a bit more compatible across systems, so as a type designer, I've switched to using the TTF flavor. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may ask why there were two types of fonts in the first place and the reason goes back to the early days of printers, when there were multiple different page description languages to tell printers how to print a page. Adobe's PostScript became a favourite (especially for publishing) and with it PostScript fonts. Apple and Microsoft didn't like having to pay royalties to Adobe to use PostScript fonts, so they got together to invent a new font format, TrueType. This led to the &quot;font wars&quot;. (Truly, that's what that period was called.) Professional typesetters and service bureaux generally regarded TrueType fonts as inferior, and that was often the case. (Not because of the format but because there were lots of badly made copies of famous fonts in TrueType. Anyone remember those &quot;1,000 fonts for $10&quot; CDs? They were TrueType.)</p>
<p>Anyway, eventually Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple all got together and came up with OpenType, which was basically a wrapper that could go around both TrueType and PostScript fonts. Windows started offering in-built support for OpenType, whereas previously you had to install an Adobe app (Adobe Type Manager) if you wanted to use PostScript fonts on a PC. OpenType also allowed far more characters than had been the case for PostScript fonts previously, which had been limited to 256 characters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OpenType (OTF) allows for more advanced use of text/glyphs/symbols than TrueType (TTF). It was developed in a way that allows font develops better, cleaner looks when using more &quot;complicated&quot; text use than simple alphanumerics. This includes any use of multiple languages, symbols, mathematical symbols with better support for Unicode. OTF better handles any changes in the positioning, size, and layout of the characters. </p>
<p>Simply put OTF is better for advanced typology or use of special characters. They are largely equivalent in their coding of how they represent characters and for standard usage of alphanumeric characters. If you have a choice between OTF and TTF, because of its broader application OTF is preferred. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
