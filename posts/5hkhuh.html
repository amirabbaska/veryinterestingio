<p><em>Now, the size of the observable universe is about 14 billion light years, and using the above value of density gives you a mass (dark and luminous matter) of about 3 x 1055 g, which is roughly 25 billion galaxies the size of the Milky Way.</em></p>
<p>How can we say this, yet believe that the universe is infinite? Does an infinite universe not imply infinite matter &amp; time &amp; space also? Or am I thinking of this wrong- are these actually conflicting theories (an amount of mass versus infinite mass)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly well-read on the subject so I'll add my two cents in here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can't estimate a quantifiable mass for the actual universe.  To the best of my knowledge, the number doesn't exist and hasn't been put forward since it became apparent a clear line existed between our <em>observable</em> universe and the remainder.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm curious about where you're getting the value you quoted in the title?  It appears to be way off (as in much too small) even for the observable universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look into Inflation - specifically the math predicting measurements regarding the &quot;flatness&quot; of the actual universe (not observable).  If flat (as has been indicated by recent measurements of the CMBR) then the universe is almost certainly infinite.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One simple approach that helped me comprehend the abstract value that is infinity was picturing it like a closed loop rather than an ever expanding void.  Our universe, if flat, is not a physical four dimensional closed loop, however the endless potential to move within a loop - and never hit a limit - is one way to think about it in a useful way.</p>
</li>
<li>If the universe is infinite, then there is infinite mass and space-time contained &quot;within&quot; it.  Though, you can't productively think of it this way because there are no bounds to the universe inside of which to be.  The universe is all.  It doesn't expand into anything.  It is what <em>is</em>.  And we see an infinitesimally small part of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What really gets me isn't the attempt to fathom infinite mass, but the attempt to fathom infinite space-time being contained within the singularity at the &quot;beginning&quot; of the universe.  It's as if the story of all that was, all that is, all that could have been, and all that will ever be was constrained to a point &quot;smaller&quot; than that which is conceivable.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im not sure if anyone passed this along. The mass is for the observable universe, that part of the entire universe which we can observe or detect.  The observable universe is the parts which light and other signals (x-rays,  radio waves, etc) have had time to reach us. </p>
<p>Speaking about an infinite universe is hypothesizing about what is beyond that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
