		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have exactly the same problem. For my whole life, regardless of how much sleep I get it's always incredibly difficult to wake up. </p>
<p>I used to think I had some kind of deficiency, or that it might be sleep apnea (I have sinus issues). I've even tried going to the doctor, but nothing has made a significant difference. </p>
<p>Sometimes something will help temporarily (like taking vitamin D, or when I started taking estrogen) but it always goes back to 'normal' after a few weeks.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell it seems to be genetic. Some people are 'morning people' and others are 'night owls'. In my experience morning people wake up early and have lots of energy in the morning, but they wear out fast and by the early evening are starting to wane. Night owls on the other hand wake up later and take a long time to build up energy in the morning, but then can keep going long into the night without feeling tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible that  you could have a sleep disorder, like sleep apnea, which causes you to wake up multiple times an hour and also deprive  your body of oxygen.  It can cause some serious health issues, including being tired all the time no matter how much you sleep.  Source: I have apnea. Talk to  your doctor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned below that you wanted an explanation of the genetic factor, so I can try and provide one for you. I'm something of an insomniac, ditto my father and sister. We all share similar tolerances to lack of sleep, to staying up, and to waking up without much effort. </p>
<p>There are a variety of endogenous hormones in your body that mediate sleepiness, and the sleep cycle. One of the most common is called &quot;adenosine&quot;. It promotes sleepiness, and suppresses arousal (sciency term for how awake you are). It's the receptor subtype thats influenced relatively well by a cup of coffee, or some other caffeinated substance.  </p>
<p>Variations in your bodies natural adenosine receptors can make you more or less receptive to the effects of this substance, in much the same way as some people have a greater or lower tolerance to alcohol or weed or even just basic dopamine / seretonin. Your bodies receptors aren't all identical to those of other people, and small variances in the genetic code can influence the effect of these receptors. These don't neccessarily have to all be based on the receptor - they could also relate to more/less efficient post-synaptic cleanup of neurotransmitters etc, but the end effect is the same : you can vary from other people in terms of how you react to the same input of neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Me + my family all appear to have a variation in this receptor (amongst other things we're not very fond of caffeine), and as a result seem to be much more &quot;awake&quot; on average than most people. I think of it as being naturally two coffees up on the average person. Some variation like this (or others, there are a lot of these chemicals that influence sleep) could account for the variation between you + your SO's sleep patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
