<p>As in, you can explain positive powers by saying the base multiplied  by itself x number of times. But how do you explain negative exponents in the same way? Can you even? 3^-2 isn't 3 x itself negative 2 times, it's just 1/3^2.</p>
<p>How do you explain this using language? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not explained well** using the same language. We initially define exponentiation to be A^(n), where A is a non-zero real number and n is a positive integer, to be A*A*...*A, where we are multiplying n of the As together. Clearly this definition does not work for any exponents except for positive integers. If we want to talk about other kinds of exponents then we need new definitions.</p>
<p>With just the &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; definition of exponentiation, there's no way to talk about A^(-1), so we're free to say that A^(-1) is whatever we want it to be. You could say that A^(-1)=pi*cos(A) if you wanted, there is initially no definition so you can do whatever you like, but there are smarter ways to define negative exponentiation. For  instance, with just the &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; definition of exponentiation you can show that if n and m are any positive integers, then A^(n+m)=A^(n)A^(m). This is the additive rule and is a very important property, it's really what makes exponentiation important in the first place, so with any definition of exponentiation to exponents that are not positive integers, we want to preserve this property. </p>
<p>Note that n=0 is not a positive integer, so the &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; definition doesn't say anything about it, but if we impose that we want the value of A^(0) to preserve the property A^(n+m)=A^(n)A^(m), even when n=0, then we get that A^(0+1)=A^(0)A^(1), and if we simplify, this means that A=A^(0)*A. Now, if A is nonzero, then we can divide through by A and get A^(0)=1. So it is through the preservation of the additive rule that we can deduce that A^(0)=1 whenever A is nonzero. This means that the only way for a 0 exponent to be defined in a way that preserves the additive rule is if A^(0)=1 (for nonzero A), so we define it to be so. Note that when A=0 we can't use this approach since we can't do the step of dividing through by A to get A^(0)=1 and, indeed, the apparent value of 0^(0) can change depending on the context you're working in.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to wrap our heads around trying to think of an interpretation of A^(-1) as some kind of repeated multiplication of A by itself -1 times, we can just impose that whatever value A^(-1) has, it <em>must</em> preserve the additive rule. With this in mind, let's try to figure out what value A^(-n) can have under this restriction (when n is a positive integer and A is nonzero). Using the additive rule, we get that A^(-n+n)=A^(-n)A^(n), but since A^(-n+n)=A^(0)=1, this becomes 1=A^(-n)A^(n), or A^(-n)=1/A^(n). Since we can compute A^(n), the expression on the right is perfectly well defined even if we didn't really define the left side. But this says that the only way that we can assign a value to A^(-n) so that the additive rule is preserved through this new definition is if we define A^(-n) to be 1/A^(n). </p>
<p>Overall it is not through the &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; definition that we end up with a value for negative exponents, it's through the process of preserving an important identity that we get it. This kind of thing also allows us to define fractional exponents like A^(n/m) (when A is positive), real exponents and even complex exponents, you start  with what you already know, find an important property to be preserved through the extension and define the extension so that the given property is not affected.</p>
<hr />
<p>** You could say &quot;minus is the opposite of addition, and division is the opposite of multiplication, so  A^(-n) is A divided by itself n times&quot;. But why would we expect the opposite of addition to translate, in this case, to the opposite of multiplication? Why doesn't it matter for something like cos(-n)? We have the opposite of addition in there, shouldn't cos(-n) be the arccos(n), the opposite of cosine? It's the additive rule that forces our hand, and anytime you hear someone just say &quot;it's the opposite of addition so it becomes the opposite multiplication&quot;, they're implicitly using the additive rule to justify translating properties of addition into properties of multiplication. This reasoning shoves what actually is happening under the rug and doesn't build concepts to help understand other things (like rational/real/complex exponents and other kinds of extensions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>first make yourself familiar with this rule:</p>
<p>3^a x 3^b = 3^(a+b)</p>
<p>eg. </p>
<p>3^2 x 3^3 = 3^5</p>
<p>because it's just:</p>
<p>( 3 x 3 ) x ( 3 X 3 X 3 )</p>
<p>play around with other exponents to prove it to yourself.</p>
<p>Now let's ask outselves... I wonder if I can write 1/3 as an exponent?? i.e.</p>
<p>1/3 = 3^k</p>
<p>Let's start with an equation we know to be true:</p>
<p>1/3 x 3^2 = 3</p>
<p>so therefore:</p>
<p>3^k x 3^2 = 3^1</p>
<p>therefore:</p>
<p>3^(k+2) = 3^1</p>
<p>therefore:</p>
<p>k+2 = 1</p>
<p>therefore </p>
<p>k = -1</p>
<p>Substituting back into our equation from earlier:</p>
<p>1/3 = 3^(-1)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I would explain it is that division is the inverse of multiplication. Just like negation flips a number around the number line, in an exponent it flips around the operation. When you negate the exponent, you go from 3^(n)/1 to 1/3^n and vice versa.</p>
<p>This also works nicely as an explanation because 3^(n) * 3^(-n) = 1, the multiplicative identity, just like n + (-n) = 0, the additive identity. You're just saying that you're doing the opposite of what the notation normally means.</p>
<p>To really understand why this is the case, you can see /u/functor7's explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't really like thinking of negative exponents in that way. </p>
<p>The definition we often use in more abstract studies is x^n = x • x^(n-1)</p>
<p>If you take n = 0, remembering x^0 = 1 then you get 1 = x • x^(-1) which rearranged gets you x^(-1) = 1/x</p>
<p>From this you can build all the negative powers </p>
<p>e.g. x^(-1) = 1/x = x • x^(-2) which yields x^(-2) = 1/(x^2)</p>
<p>This is a bit more abstract but it helped me understand the origin of the notation a lot more</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
