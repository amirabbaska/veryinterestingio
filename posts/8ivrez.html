I'm wondering if there is a known or possible reason that visible light is...well, visible to organisms and not other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, or if the first organisms to evolve sight just happened to see in the visible wavelengths and it just perpetuated.</p>
<p>Not sure if this belonged in biology or physics but I guessed biology edit: I guessed wrong, it's more of a physics thing according to answers so far so I changed the flair for those who come after</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody is saying it's the peak emission spectrum of the sun, and that's true. But another very important concept is that water is also transparent in visible range. Water actually has a very broad absorption spectrum, it blocks almost all EM radiation except visible. So if you had a creature developing in water, it would certainly need detection in the visible range to see through it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else's replies are correct (peak of the solar radiation spectrum etc), but allow me to answer from a chemist's perspective.</p>
<p>Now first off let me say that everything I'm about to say about the visible spectrum is also true of the near parts of the UV and IR spectrums, but we are still talking about a relatively narrow band.</p>
<p>The big unique chemical property of light in the visible spectrum is that this is where non-destructive electronic transitions occur. This means that a proton of visible light can excite certain electrons in molcules to higher energy levels without breaking the molecule in half. This is important for making sight useful for two reasons. First there is a wide range of variability in spectra here, meaning things look different and are therefore easier to discriminate based on color etc. Also the biological mechanisms used to detect light (rods and cones) aren't destroyed in the process (or at least it's not as bad, they are still pretty fragile to light). They are specifically tuned to change shape, which is something is easy for our biology to detect.</p>
<p>By comparison far UV has a high enough energy that it can break molecules, which is why it causes sunburn. Another problem with UV (including the near parts) is that it is high enough energy that there are lots of  transitions (destructive and otherwise), so proportionally more molecules absorb in this range.</p>
<p>Far IR on the other hand is too weak of an energy to cause electronic transitions. This is where vibrational transitions happen and why hot (vibrating) molecules have a unique spectrum in this range. Moreover everything emits in this range just due to being warm.  That'd be great for identifying different materials if we could see it, but the problem is that our eyes are warm too! It would be a much more complex task of teasing out a change in the vibration of a molecule in our eye at a specific frequency rather than a change in shape. Is this pissible? Well the molecules that detect heat in your skin can but not with any sort of disciminating ability. Just a taller task for evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the sun emits more light in the visible light part of the spectrum than any other part, so there's more to see there than UV or IR or other areas of the spectrum. And if you're wondering why the sun emits more visible light than other wavelengths that's because the black body radiation of a body the temperature of the sun is mostly visible light, a hotter star would emit more UV and a cooler star would emit more IR</p>
