		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First things first. Most of it wasn't. We are biased to seeing an overrepresentation of 'giant' life in the past, for a number of reasons. They're easier to find, they have a better chance of surviving as fossils. They're more impressive in monster movies and museum displays. Lots of factors like the 'wow factor' mean we focus on the giant tyrannosaurus rex, and not the 25 pound dilong. </p>
<p>Furthermore, some of the life today <em>is</em> so large. Our whales are quite big. In fact, the blue whale is the biggest animal we've ever known to live, period. Bigger than any dinosaur, any mammoth, any other animal we know of.</p>
<p>Now, why does life get large? This can vary, but one theory is it is can arise from something of an arms race. As you know, animals evolve and that evolution is driven in part by natural selection, where various beneficial adaptations help survival. Being able to fly, having a tough shell, running really fast. These can help something survive a predator. Well, another thing is being really big. For instance, elephants, once they are grown, very rarely face predatory threats (outside of humans). This may have been the case with some dinosaurs as well. Now, what kind of adaptation might a predator evolve to deal with large prey? Well, being big too. And now the prey has a potential to evolve to be bigger <em>again</em> and so on.</p>
<p>In circumstances like these, being bigger can be an advantage.</p>
<p>Now, this is also helped by the fact that there's lots of food around. A big body takes a lot of energy. If some meteor, for instance, comes and blasts the planet, shrouding it in darkness and making it hard for plants to grow, suddenly food is a lot more scarce. Suddenly, being huge is a <em>big problem</em> and being small is beneficial. Who survives? the little guys.</p>
<p>Now, that might help explain the extinction of (some of) the dinosaurs, but no meteor wiped out mammoths right? Well, we've got a new catastrophe for them. Man. We spread all over the globe. We burn down forests for agriculture. We hunt large animals for food. We eliminate anything we find threatening. Increasingly, we divide up the landscape into smaller and smaller chunks. All of these factors make being a big animal a problem again. We either want to eat you, or we're afraid of you, or you need a lot of territory and we're farming all of it, and so on. </p>
<p>TLDR: Sometimes being big provides an advantage. Sometimes it doesn't. Those times when it does, sometimes then animals evolve to become larger. If it stops being advantage, then they may go extinct or otherwise evolve to become smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At points in the planet's history, it had way more oxygen in the air, which could support larger animals.</p>
</li>
<li>We are looking at fossils over an enormous range of time. So, even though there were not that many huge dinosaurs, in a few million years all sorts of evolutionary dead-ends were hit</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dinosaurs and mammoths are very different things. Dinosaurs lived many millions of years ago. Mammoths were alive at the same time as humans, and it is believed that humans were the main cause of their extinction, from hunting. There is a worldwide pattern of very large animals (called &quot;megafauna&quot;) going extinct soon after humans first arrived to the area. Big animals are especially vulnerable to uncontrolled hunting because there are fewer individuals and tend they tend to take longer to reproduce, so the population cannot recover as well.</p>
<p>As for dinosaurs, they were not all big. They came in all different sizes. That <em>includes</em> some of the largest animals ever, but that should not be surprising, since there were so many of them and they were around for 180 million years. The <em>largest</em> animal ever, however, is alive <em>right now</em>: the blue whale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is not quite true. The largest know animal ever on earth is alive today. The Blue whale where typical males have a weight of 45â€“136 tonnes and the heaviest reported was 173 tonnes.</p>
<p>The estimated mean weight of a dinosaurs is 4282 kg and the median 630 kg.  So most dinosauries was small but som was enormous. The mean weight is close to elephants.</p>
<p>There was a lot a larger animals relative reticently. They disappeared in different part of the earth at different time but it coincide whit arrival of humans. So we are likely a large part of why as they are relative few and if we can and do hunt them we can exterminate them relative quickly. We are not the only reson but a important part of it</p>
