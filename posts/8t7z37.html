		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your limb/leg as a long, leg shaped peninsula with its blood supply being a busy road network.
Large arteries are like highways with turnoffs (collateral branches), smaller vessels are like smaller side roads, capillaries are like residential streets and alleyways. All roads heading down the peninsula away from the mainland function like arteries, while roads heading back up the peninsula function as veins.</p>
<p>Now, a massive bomb was dropped on the furthest tip of the peninsula and destroyed all of it including the roads (a distal limb amputation), but left the closer bit completely unharmed. Traffic can still flow in and around the point of destruction by taking turnoffs prior to that point, and can turn back by taking the smaller roads and alleyways to get back on the highway heading back in the other direction. This is what happens in an amputation; the arm/leg is removed and the big blood vessels at the site of amputation are cut and tied off right at the stump, but proximal to that everything still works as normal.</p>
<p>As a side note, even amputation stumps need reasonable blood supply to heal up at all. This means that people who have compromised smaller collateral vessels may have a hard time getting their stump healed up. The best example of this is if a patient with an occluded profunda femoris artery (an important smaller “side turnoff road” compared to the larger superficial femoral artery “highway”) undergoes a below-knee amputation, they will have serious issues getting their stump completely healed, if ever at all.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As arteries go away from your heart, they have many little branches that go off and supply blood to the surrounding tissue that the artery is passing through. The artery in turn gets smaller and smaller as it goes because it's losing blood to the smaller branches. So if you amputate a leg below the knee for example, almost all the tissue on remaining part of the leg is still getting it's blood supply (from the small branches). </p>
<p>The main arteries do need to be &quot;tied off,&quot; however, so you don't bleed to death, and besides the rest of the leg they were serving isn't there anymore anyway.  On the flip side, a similar but mirrored process happens with the veins, which collect the blood after it's moved through the tissues.</p>
<p>Of course this isn't a perfect process, and some small areas of tissue on the stump will be left without a proper blood supply. Those areas either wither and shrink or the body grows new blood vessels into that area, which it has the ability to do on a small scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not restored. Major vessels are tied off with suture....Amputations are relatively simple. Knife cuts through the skin. Bovie burns small bleeders. Larger vessels are tied off.  Nerves are cut. Saw through the bone. Close the skin like a fish mouth or return later for definitive closure depending on the patients condition.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood vessels are living tissue, and can adapt to new conditions. Capillaries (the smallest vessels) can pretty much pop into and out of being. The intermediate vessels can grow or shrink to accommodate changes in circulation. So any tissues that need blood will get it, supposing they are near enough to a branching artery.</p>
<p>Even the worst amputations don't seriously change how blood flows, absent the areas it can no longer go. For example, the network of vessels that feed your biceps doesn't take a detour past your elbow.</p>
<p>Doctors ensure that any major vessels are &quot;capped off&quot; so you don't bleed to death, and will excise any tissues likely to become necrotic due to low perfusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
