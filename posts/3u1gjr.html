		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people believe it.  That's why and he's shady about it, he skirts the line just enough.</p>
<p>I despise Dr. Oz and everyone like him.  From psychics to &quot;ghost&quot; hunters, these people are literally what holds the human race back and they exist on every continent on the planet.</p>
<p>We as a people do not generally care about the truth, only what makes us feel better/stronger or included in some way. We take pleasure from listening to the guy &quot;on the outside&quot; and getting privileged information &quot;they&quot; don't want you to know. or are hiding from you.  The one who presents himself as the anti-establishment guy. Every single one of us here on reddit, right now is in one way or another an accomplice.  There is something YOU believe in that is pure bullshit.  We are all guilty.</p>
<p>Dr. Oz is like your grandmother telling you not to go outside in the winter when you are wet.. you'll surely catch a cold. That shit stayed with you until this day.. didn't it?
Yea, because you trusted your grandmother and she trusted hers.  This guy is using that part of your brain that trusts and doesn't bother to research, using it to shill products.</p>
<p>My wife has this show on in the background (I work from home) and I occasionally get a glimpse of it.  This guy will tell you one day that <em>this item</em> is the way to lose weight like crazy, then the next day it's <em>this</em> item and so on, it's a never ending stream of &quot;this is the miracle you've been looking for 'Trust me, I am Dr. Oz and I am on TV!'&quot;</p>
<p>Some of his statements that were brought up at the senate hearing (not said at the hearing just quoted):</p>
<p><em>&quot;'You may think magic is make believe but this little bean has scientists saying they've found the magic weight loss cure for every body typeâ€”it's green coffee extract.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;'I've got the No. 1 miracle in a bottle to burn your fat. It's raspberry ketones.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;'Garcinia Camboja. It may be the simple solution you've been looking for to bust your body fat for good.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Which one is it OZ?  Which one is it?</em></strong></p>
<p>What is supremely frustrating is that he IS a doctor and he SHOULD know better.  People trust this guy with their lives on and off the screen and that's scary.</p>
<p>It's a fine line between lying and opinion.  I can go on TV, make a big deal about Ghosts knowing full well I am lying about it and I can make a million dollars to all the gullible people. The guys on Ghost Busters?  They are professional Liars.  They have never caught a ghost on tape, they have never heard a voice in a house/building that was not explainable and yet, there they sit, millions in their bank account.  Each episode drives you to the next, maybe NEXT week they will have it!  Next week we got wide some more eyed expressions, personal gasps and quick camera cuts! I would bet they actually laugh when they check their bank accounts.  And why?  Because the masses eat it up.  We're all stuck in our little selective bias. There are no 'ghosts' people. Everyone you know who has passed is now on their way back to being stardust.</p>
<p>There will always be a person who believes in ghosts, always be someone willing to watch and willing to buy what Dr Oz is selling.</p>
<p>There are no ghosts, there is no bigfoot and no little green men have landed in that farm down the road in bumfuck Kentucky. And buying this weeks new wonder weight loss berry will not instantly make you Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt, no matter who tells you it <em>might</em>. Dr Oz is a paid shill, one of thousands on TV every day.</p>
<p>This guys really grinds my fucking gears. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He's not <em>really</em> giving out health advice. Instead, he protects himself by merely reporting what others say. He'll never say &quot;/u/DanaNotDonna's itchy feet will be cured by eating dryer lint.&quot; Instead, he'll quote a study like this: &quot;According to a recent study by the Home Appliance Institute, 57% of people who eat dryer lint say their feet do not itch.&quot; So it's the authors of the study making the claim, except not really. The study authors are going to say something non-committal like &quot;Although a positive correlation was found between dryer lint consumption and non-itchy feet, more study is needed and it will be several years before the production of dryer-lint based medicines.&quot;  </p>
<p>Dr. Oz can also shield himself by interviewing a guest about the problem instead of making any statement himself. &quot;What options are there for people with itchy feet?&quot; &quot;Well, a recent study . . .&quot; So, you'll have to go through 3 or more layers of people to finally find someone who didn't really say your itchy feet would be helped by the dryer lint anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Oz's BS is nothing compared to what drug companies can legally get away with.</p>
<p>It is perfectly legal in the US for a drug company to fund multiple studies, not release the results of studies that make their drug look ineffective (they are required to report safety data though), pay a &quot;medical ghostwriter&quot; (basically a marketing expert with limited medical knowledge) to write an puff piece article based on the positive study data, and then pay what they refer to as &quot;key opinion leaders&quot; (basically highly respected doctors in their field) to make slight revisions to the article and then sign their name on it as authors without any mention of the drug company or ghost writers involvement.  </p>
<p>Most major universities in the US also do NOT have a policy against professors &quot;authoring&quot; papers in this way because it brings them more esteem and better odds at getting grant money from the government for &quot;legit&quot; research.</p>
<p>Paxil study 329 is probably the best known example of this although they crossed the line by committing fraud in this study. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_329" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_329</a></p>
<p>Many of GSK's internal documents related to this can be found at the US Justice departments website because they get sued partially over this study under the False Claims Act for defrauding the government.  They paid $3 Billion to settle it which is largest pharmaceutical settlement in history although they probably profited from it anyway given the sales of the drugs involved.  <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents-and-resources-july-2-2012-glaxosmithkline-gsk-press-conference" target="_blank">http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents-and-resources-july-2-2012-glaxosmithkline-gsk-press-conference</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
