		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically because it never affected Western society as much. You notice how people crack Nazi jokes about the Germans all the time - and none about Imperial Japan? It's because the Japanese Empire and their atrocities simply aren't well known. It's important to recognise that it's the same way in China; if you were to fly the Rising Sun Flag in Beijing, you would quite rightly get a proper thrashing. Fly the Swastika? Weird looks at most. It's just that things matter a lot more when they happen to people close to you, who are similar to you. </p>
<p>In addition, the West has made a (justified) concerted effort to completely destroy Nazism's reputation. Nothing of the sort happened in Japan. There just wasn't an awareness of what happened in the East, outside of those actually involved in the Pacific theater, so Japan never had the reputational demolition that the Nazis had. I don't mean to imply that Western media intended to &quot;protect&quot; Japan as such, or that they swept it under the rug. It's just that there was both a lack of awareness, and also just a lack of fucks to give in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it could be simply because people in the West don't know or don't pay attention to what happened in the East. </p>
<p>People in China and Korea are still quite upset/mad/angry at the Japanese for what happened during the war, especially since there has been no real apology. </p>
<p>I know some people that look at what the Japanese did as a genocide. In Nanjing they were killing men, women, and children, even pregnant women got a nice bayonet to their abdomen. </p>
<p>There is the comfort women, Chinese and Korea women taken as sex slaves. I'm willing to bet the same thing happened in the Philippines and Singapore. </p>
<p>There are the human experiments they did on people in China, all kinds of rank shit, like live dissections, freezing peoples extremities off to see what happens. </p>
<p>But none of this really happened or was not talked about in the western countries. So it is like it never happened. I'm willing to bet most people in North America don't know about the human experiments they did. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cause it has roots and meanings far deeper and older than WW2.</p>
<p>South Korea however does consider it to be bad. Just recently with the game Persona 5, the devs removed the symbol from a characters sneakers for the Korean release for this very reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The swastika was an ideological symbol of Nazism while the rising sun was a symbol of Japan. The golden eagle which were a symbol also used by Nazi Germany but were a symbol of German greatness are still in use today. The situation in Japan and in Germany were quite different. While Germany were &quot;taken over&quot; by the Nazi party and the Nazi ideology Japans attempt at making an empire came from within and were considered more clean. The situation after the war were also quite different. Germans were angry at the Nazis and a lot of them even switched sides at the end of the war. Whereas in Japan the feeling was more of a &quot;we tried but did not make it&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Rising Sun flag that was used by the Imperial Japanese Army <em>is</em> looked down upon and hated as much as the swastika, actually, at least insofar as other Asian countries are concerned. When the JSSDF was established after the war, the Maritime Self-Defense Force adopted the same ensign the Imperial Japanese Navy used during the war, but the Ground SDF had to use a very different one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
