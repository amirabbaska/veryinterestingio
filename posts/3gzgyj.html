	<title>This is not a 'cicada year,' but I hear one buzzing outside right now. Is there a small set of cicadas out of sync with the main population, or do a few mistakenly mature early every year? Or is this a different species entirely?</title>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 'cicada years' every 13 and 17 years in the eastern US, where cicadas emerge by the fucktillions and take over everything. </p>
<p>But there are a few cicadas every year. I find them and their molted shells all over my yard, and I hear them buzzing away. What are <em>these</em> cicadas? The ones that pop up even when it's not a 'cicada year'. </p>
<p>Are they the same species as either the 13 or 17 year cicada, but a year out of sync? Are they late comers or early bloomers whose development cycle missed a year and caused them to miss the party, and so they pop up without anyone else around to mate with? Or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago - if so, will they diverge into a separate species after enough time? It seems like this would be a remarkable sort of allopatric speciation that's happening- instead of the population being divided by a river, they get separated by a year in their life cycle. Or is that crazy because their life cycle is very rigidly 13/17 years and there's just no way in hell they're deviate from that?</p>
<p>Is it all of these or none of these? Or are the cicadas this year a different species entirely? </p></div></div>
