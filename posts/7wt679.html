		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the magnetic fields of the Sun and unfortunately the complete physics behind the Suns magnetic dynamo is not entirely understood.<br />
Basically what happens though is that you have two kinds of magnetic fields, one that goes around the Sun like the equator, a toroidal field, and one that goes out of the Suns surface and then back in again, a poloidal field. During a solar maximum the poloidal field is very weak and the toroidal field very strong and during a solar minimum vice versa. The magnetic fields and the Suns rotation interact with eachother in such a way that it causes a periodical pattern. In fact the &quot;real&quot; Sun cycle is 22 years long, not 11, because there is a change in polarity as well.<br />
After a solar maximum we have a solar minimum followed by a solar maximum in the opposite direction of the first one and then a solar minimum again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 11 year cycle is something scientists noticed quite some time ago. It started it by noticing sun spot activity. Sun spots would follow an 11 year cycle. For 5.5 years sunspots would become more frequent. This was followed by a 5.5 year period where the frequency of sunspots decreased.</p>
<p>After some time it was noticed that an increase in sunspots coincided with an increase in temperature on earth. The natural conclusion was that an increase in sunspots meant an increase in solar energy output of the sun. This has since been confirmed by advances in science.</p>
<p>As for the reasons behind the actual cycle I just don't know. A quick Google search did not give me a reason other than the cycle is also related to the magnetic field of the sun. So perhaps we just don't know why it happens</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One important part of the 11 year cycle is the occurrence of the Aurora Borealis, which is tied to solar flares.  Some years you'll have the most amazing shows, where others are pretty disappointing.  Unfortunately we're currently pretty close to the bottom of the cycle, which peaked in 2013-2014.</p>
<p>Aurora photographers can use available solar weather information to predict when is best to go out shooting, and it would be great if tourists knew more about it, too.  I've had friends from Germany go up North in Canada looking for the Northern Lights, only to fall asleep at 11 on a perfect night when the Lights came out after midnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:</p>
<p>The Sun has magnetic field lines just like the Earth that run from the North Pole to the South Pole.  The Sun also rotates just like the Earth, but it's not solid like the Earth.  The poles rotate faster than the equator, so those magnetic fields lines get all twisted.</p>
<p>Eventually everything gets so twisted and jumbled that the Sun snaps everything back into place by switching the North and South poles.  This works for a little while before everything gets all twisted again.  And this twisting cycle happens about every 11 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
