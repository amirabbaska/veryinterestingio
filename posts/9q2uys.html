		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of interest one has in the endeavor. Say for instance, as a language teacher, you’re teaching students that are either very keen on the subject or resistant to it due to the amount of interest they have in the language. The students who are more interested in the subject will always do better than the students who are in class due to parental pressure.
Another good example is when I moved to South Korea with my best friend, we both came to the country with an equal amount of knowledge of the language spoken here. I went on to learning the language far quicker than he did due to his lack of willingness to learn. But, we both also studied Japanese too, here he excelled at the same rate I did in Korean.
The brain has a tendency to turn off the recording mechanism when it appears to have found unimportant information, where as it records and holds onto information it enjoys or has an interest in.
This is just one example I’m giving to why somethings are memorized faster and longer than other things. From my experiences as an ESL teacher for 15 years in South Korea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You remember stuff that you care about. I can still remember what bands made certain pop songs from 50 years ago. I was interested in pop music back then.</p>
<p>I don't care for current pop music. I could try to memorise who recently recorded what and could probably do it in order to win a bet but a month later I will have forgotten it all.</p>
<p>If you <strong>need</strong> to memorise stuff that isn't interesting, there are tricks you can use. On the lines of making extremely silly connections to the data.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about the difference between &quot;memorize&quot; and &quot;remember.&quot;  What are some things you have <em>memorized</em>?  What are some things you <em>remember</em>?  Most people would distinguish &quot;memorize&quot; as a list of information, facts, things someone has told you, while &quot;remember&quot; refers to something  you experienced or which happened to you.  I memorized the list of items to get at the grocery store from what my husband suggested.  I <em>remembered</em> to get milk because I poured out the last of it this morning.  You are more likely to remember things you experience because those items/events are directly relevant to you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The fancy distinction for this is &quot;semantic&quot; (fact) vs &quot;episodic&quot; (event) memory.  Episodic memory involves greater connectivity in the brain when being formed and when being recalled, intertwined very strongly with emotion.  Because experiencing an emotion is often a signal that what's happening right now is REALLY IMPORTANT, a greater &quot;groundwork&quot; for that memory is laid in the brain.  When sculpting that memory, your emotional state, current context (location, music you're listening to, people you see, ambient smells) also become part of that memory--I was tired when I poured out that milk this morning, I was listening to the traffic report on the radio, and I had just made coffee.  So when I'm driving the store and pass by a coffee stand, yawning because I'm still exhausted, and the jingle for the hourly traffic report comes on the radio, I suddenly remember &quot;Oh yeah, have to pick up some milk!&quot;  But when my husband rattles off a list of things he wants from the store, I don't have a particularly strong emotion, visual (or other sensory experience), or context that specifically relates to that information.  It didn't happen directly to me, it didn't grab my attention very well, and it wasn't accompanied by a strong feeling.   Why would my brain bother making this a memory?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is why &quot;experiental learning&quot; can be so powerful--putting on skits in history class instead of just writing lists of dates and events, performing experiments in science class instead of looking at diagrams...  Those create prolonged experiences accompanied by emotion and many other sensory &quot;cues&quot; to anchor that information.  In fact, many &quot;memory tricks&quot; rely on creating even artificial/mental experiences to remember lists of information--when I was young I had a book to help kids remember state capitols using little cartoons and one-sentence visuals:  A cartoon heart driving a car over a person's wound: Hartford, Connecticut.  A field full of metal springs making creepy sounds: Springfield, Illinois.  Those weird, cutesy drawings are appealing to kids, they grab attention easily, and each page had the image described TWO ways.  The point is not to <em>memorize</em> the sentence, but to <em>remember</em> the cartoon.  That creates a cue to remember the information later.  This is similar to the &quot;Method of Loci&quot; technique, in which you pair items in a list of information to some route, location, or event you are already familiar with: &quot;I imagine myself walking into the house and put my keys on the table, where I see a carton of milk.  I set my purse down on the couch next to a head of broccoli.  As I go into the bathroom, I see that the sink is full of Spaghettios!&quot;  Now when I go to to the store, I imagine walking through my house: I need to get milk, broccoli, and Spaghettios!  I've tied this mundane list to a memory I already have, and which already has strong emotional connections for me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, to sum up, if you want to remember (not memorize!) information, act it out, make it personal, turn it into an experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory mainly works by meanings and associations. The more meaning you give something and associations you give it the easier it is to remember. For example the Memory Palace or Loci method employs imagining something to remember another thing since this is mainly how memory works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
