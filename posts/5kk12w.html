		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perceived convince and portion control. </p>
<p>A huge problem for businesses is users who take way more of bathroom goods that they actually would need, wasting goods and leading to more frequent empty situations.   </p>
<p>Automatic dispensers usually have some delay between dispensing portions of a product, making it more difficult to take a ridiculous amount of soap or towels.  </p>
<p>Users may also percive automatic dispensers as cleaner even if it isn't necessarily true</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have some ideas about why somebody would install an automatic dispenser:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They don't want the dispenser to get all germy. That's not good for anybody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have something visible like motor oil or mud on your hands, it would transfer to the dispenser, making it appear dirty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't want you pumping that thing ten times, taking way too much soap.</p>
</li>
<li>Automatic dispensers are probably more accessible to people with certain injuries or disabilities.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hygiene - 95% of people do not wash their hands correctly. To touch a soap dispenser or faucet or door handle is like touching the genitals of 95% of everyone who have used it. </p>
<p>If I can't wash, dry, and exit without touching a surface in a public restroom, I don't wash at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think simplest answer is that they don't want people to steal, ruin or displace soap. If there was bar of soap, people would leave it in the sink or wherever and dirt would stick to it and it would look pretty horrible pretty soon. If there's a bottle, again, it may fall onto dirty floor, be sticky and covered in dirt and someone's hair and all that. And janitors should look for it every time.</p>
<p>Fixed into a metal box on the wall is easy to refill and keep track of.
Portion control makes sense too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it might be be to minimize the 'attack surface', I've read somewhere that the door handle is the most dirty. You touch the handle, you touch you're private areas, you touch the soap dispenser.. But you might also touch your face, clothing and other areas like the dispenser. </p>
<p>Besides, a lot of public restrooms don't have hot/warm water in which case the cleaning of your hands might not be very effective at all. Less area equals less germs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
