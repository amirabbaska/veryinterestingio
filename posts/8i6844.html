<p>For example: if a human body has multiple fractures, severed nerves, multiple lacerated organs, internal bleeding and cuts and bruises, how does the body react to the healing process? Which of the wounds and damaged areas it starts to heal first? </p>
<p>I am aware of different kinds of shocks and reactions to the human body, but lets cast those aside.</p>
<p>Is it strictly related to DNA only or is there some sort of other mechanisms the body/brain uses?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hematology MD here - good question! </p>
<p>If you're thinking of the body like the Enterprise or something (damage control teams to E deck!) the short answer is no, there isn't a mechanism like that, with a set reserve of 'repair ability.'</p>
<p>Since your question focuses on two different 'levels' of damage, e.g. at the DNA/cellular level, and in the trauma setting e.g. lacerated organs, internal bleeding, cuts/bruises etc, I'll answer them separately.</p>
<p>On a cellular level, multiple DNA repair mechanisms exist - Dr Paul Modrich won the nobel prize in 2015 for exploring some of these. The individual cell has an incredible ability to reconstitute / repair DNA following damage; if damage is so great that I can't be repaired, the cell will self-destruct, so to speak; failure to do so is one mechanism by which cancer arises. However, the ability of individual cells to repair themselves is distinct from that of macroscopic injuries.</p>
<p>In the trauma setting, the circulating coagulation factors / prothrombotic pathways become activated, to stop bleeding. It's not a specific process (e.g. bypass the cut on your arm to stop the bleeding in your spleen) but rather occurs wherever the pro-coagulant mediators see damage. That's part of the problem in conditions like sepsis/severe injury - a condition called DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) develops with massive activation of the pro-coagulant pathways in an effort to stop bleeding (or as an 'accidental activation' in the setting of inflammation, where you get similar procoagulant markers expressed). In DIC, you get concurrent bleeding/clotting, since the pro-coagulant factors that are meant to stop bleeding are being used up faster than the body can produce them, while concurrently, clots (thrombi) are forming, often inappropriately. </p>
<p>It would actually be really helpful in the setting of DIC if something like a priority list did exist, so the less important injuries would be ignored and the more serious ones dealt with. </p>
<p>I hope that's helpful! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good question, one that comes up all the time in my profession as an ICU physician. As /u/SGDJ points out, blood flow is key to not only the bodily repair process, but also to its normal homeostatic function. One way to gain insight into what the body “prioritizes” as vital for function is to note what happens when the body is in a shock state. This occurs for example when there is massive blood loss (i.e. hemorrhagic shock). The body will attempt to compensate for diminished oxygen delivery to the tissues by shunting blood away from less essential organ systems to those that are ‘vital’ in the immediate sense. What we see in this scenario is that blood shunts <em>away</em> from skin, kidneys, liver, intestines and <em>towards</em> three main organs: <strong>the brain, the heart, and the adrenal glands.</strong></p>
<p>The reason for this priority is abundantly clear. The most important organ to ultimate survival is the brain. It is also the most sensitive to hypoxia injury. Therefore, the heart must be able to sustain cardiac output and oxygen delivery. And the adrenal glands that secrete vasogenic hormones like epinephrine and dopamine are necessary to regulate it all.</p>
<p>There is constant debate regarding which organ systems should be deemed ‘vital,’ but in actuality, blood flow is preserved to those three organ systems in a shock state in an attempt to preserve immediate survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are multiple parts to your question. As u/SGDJ mentioned, a factor in wound healing is going to be vascularization of the tissue. Another is how readily new cells can migrate to the afflicted area to make repairs. It will also depend on the ability of the area to become &quot;re-vascularized&quot; - a process called angiogenesis. Other factors, such as mechanical strain, infection, edema, necrosis, etc, are going to affect some areas more than others. </p>
<p>Some tissues are going to &quot;repair&quot; quickly, but leave scars. So, the priority is going to be &quot;fill in all the holes&quot; with blood coagulation, swelling and temporary repair, followed by extensive repair. It's not going to be as location dependent, as it is how much needs to be done to fix the area. For instance, your body knows you need to stop bleeding before anything else, so your blood clots and cells come to sort of patch up that area (usually in minutes/hours). The tissues that are damaged as a result of the injury won't be able to respond as quickly. Immediately after injury, you will have an adrenaline response that directs blood flow toward some areas that are more central to the body (brain, internals), and away from your periphery.</p>
<p>Internal bleeding is a product of damage, and that leads to all kinds of pressure changes inside the body which will be dependent on the afflicted organ to clot and rectify whatever has happened to it before you die. It will take some time to clear the body of waste in areas that are not usually perfused with blood (such as the area surrounding your lungs).</p>
<p>Bruises are sort of similar, where you have simply broken a shallow bed of capillaries that must repair. So, for a bruise to go away, you just need replace the vascular and surrounding damaged tissue in the area. Usually, not a big deal and can heal up over the course of days/weeks.</p>
<p>Lacerated organs, however, are going to have a harder time, because many of those tissues are highly specialized, and will form scar tissue (made of fibroblasts and collagen) that sort of secure the are from further harm or from bleeding out, before the specialized cells get a chance to migrate there and mature. This is going to affect different tissues to various degrees, depending on how specialized the tissue is (e.g., a scar on your heart is a big deal, because those cells don't replicate easily and are very specialized, so it essentially never heals to 100% before the injury). </p>
<p>If you're talking about a fracture to a bone, it's again going to depend on vascularization, the size of the bone, etc. Cells will go there to remove damaged parts, create a scaffolding for new bone to form, then you have to have cells that will form new bone come in, mature, and fill in the area. Going to be extensive, and doesn't always come out correctly on its own.</p>
<p>Severed nerves are tricky. They need some sort of intervention, typically, but peripheral (those not in your brain or spine) nerves can heal quite naturally, given the right environment. This is different than other wounds which are simply replacing damaged cells with new ones, because a nerve is made of really long individual neuron fibers called 'axons'. These axons have to connect to the other half of the same cell that got severed in order to heal properly. Luckily, your body can do it with the assistance of cells called Schwann cells, that essentially migrate to the area, create a tunnel of cells, and help facilitate removing the damaged part of the axon and giving it a path with all the signals it needs to grow back together. This can take a very long time (months/years).</p>
<p>Damages in the brain aren't usually repaired easily, and if you're lucky to not have an embolism, or stroke, then you'll see that the neurons that die will be cleaned out and replaced with glial cells that kind of keep everything going the best they can (proper pressure and nutrient supply to unaffected areas). Neurons don't really grow back (at least the ones that were in a network that died won't be immediately replaced). After some swelling, cleaning up all the mess, and going through this process called &quot;gliosis,&quot; I guess you'd eventually call that healed as much it's going to be. </p>
<p>TL;DR: There's not particularly a priority list, but rather stages of healing. Some areas of the body have more stages than others.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is one real phenomena that is one the most interesting things in physiology to me.  The highest priority is cerebral perfusion. (Making sure you have adequate driving pressure to get oxygen and other nutrients to the brain). There is times that the body will protect that at almost any cost. If you use too much oxygen and outstrip your hearts ability to pump oxygenated blood. The brain will shut down your body (pass out) to ensure it gets enough blood. It's the phenomenon of seeing triathletes collapse near the end of the course. </p>
<p>Seems like a high priority to me.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. I have a bit of experience with healing after being severely damaged. In 1989 I was ejected from a car during a high speed roll over. I suffered C5,C6, and T3 spinal fractures, a lacerated liver, a dislocated shoulder, both collar bones broken, several ribs broken (including several right at the sternum that could not be set which now are raised up and very weird feeling), and facial contusions. I was 6'3&quot; and weighed about 155. My body fed off itself rapidly over the next three weeks and even with a gastric tube constantly feeding me I got down to 116. My hair was shaved over my ears for a traction apparatus and grew about an inch in three weeks. I wore a size 11 tennis shoe when I had the accident and wore a 12 two months later. I'm also closer to 6'4&quot; now. My body basically went into a healing overdrive that healed all the broken bones and the shoulder in about 4 or 5 weeks. I was only 18 and very healthy so that was a huge factor the doctors said, along with the overall trauma causing my healing factor to go crazy. I was up walking with a crutch in about 5 weeks too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
