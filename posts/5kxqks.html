<p>Then they exhaust themselves trying to breath.  While in water, they don't have to work against gravity to expand their lungs.  On land, a whale is lifting several tons each time the inhale.</p>
<p>Finally, larger whales can crush themselves.  All of that pressure on their organs can block circulation and even damage them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Two main reasons; weight and their skin. Sea mammals that don't normally venture on to land, like dolphins and whales, aren't built to carry their body weight and would get crushed under their own girth. For the ones small enough to survive their own weight for a bit, they still need to be kept wet and somewhat shaded as they can suffer burns or dehydrate quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
