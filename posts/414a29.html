		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water wouldn't boil, it would go in a metastable superheated state. It's liquid above the boiling temperature. A sufficient shock, even mechanical, would trigger a violent transition of the whole mass of fluid to the stable mixed-phase state. That is a good part of the water would suddenly boil.</p>
<p>Translated: do not heat distilled or even still water in a microwave. Microwaves are designed to heat water as uniformly as possible. If the cup is smooth enough not to provide good nucleation points for bubbles, and the heating is uniform enough and the water is relatively devoid of particles, it can be superheated above boiling temp without actually boiling. When you take it out, everything looks normal. You put in your teabag, the water suddenly boils all at the same time. Splashing boiling water on your face. This has happen, iirc.</p>
<p>This can be understood by studying the Van der Waals equation of state. Under the critical temperature, a portion of each VdW isotherm does not actually describe stable states, but a metastable states. This is because there actually is a set of more stable states which are mixed-phase states, that is the fluid is divided in a gas and liquid phases - this is the flat part of the isotherms and describes the actual phase transition where part of the liquid starts boiling  and then this fraction gradually increases until all of it is gas. If you don't give it a chance to form inhomogeneities though, you can get onto that metastable part of the VdW eqt of state. As soon as that inhomogeneity is provided, we decay to the stable state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've rediscovered the Bubble Chamber in experimental physics.   That's exactly how it worked, although using liquid hydrogen.</p>
<p>When a fluid is sufficiently superheated, then all the ion-tracks of natural background radiation will trigger the growth of bubbles.</p>
<p>But first, you need to somehow scavange up all the natural microbubbles already present in a real-world liquid.  The &quot;nucleation sites&quot; for boiling are the existing microbubbles, just as the nucleation sites for crystal growth are the seed crystals.  When a liquid exceeds boiling temp, invisibly small bubbles trapped on bits of dirt (or in microfractures on container walls) will produce rapidly expanding boiling-bubbles.  To rid your system of all bubble-seeds, just boil it in a vacuum for awhile.  Much of the dissolved gas will come out of solution as roiling effervescence.  Then let it sit at room pressure, and any remaining microbubbles will shrink away to nothing, as their contents dissolve in the degassed liquid.</p>
<p>PS if superheated water inside heavy radiation shielding and on the threshold of explosive boiling was exposed to sound waves, the negative pressure excursions from the sound would probably be enough to push it over the edge.</p>
<p>So don't cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you could make a 3D ultrasonic standing wave pattern inside the liquid, the pattern would trigger bubbles at the acoustic antinodes during extreme superheating.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bubbles will form on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation" target="_blank">nucleation</a> sites, which can be any of a multitude of things. These would include but not be limited to: imperfections in the container where the container meets the water, impurities <em>in</em> the water (anything from dissolved calcium to a spoon), turbulence in the water itself--essentially any disturbance in the water.</p>
<p>But if you manage to limit those disturbances, water will provide its own nucleation sites via small fluctuations of the individual water molecules. If nothing else makes a bubble, water will spontaneously bubble around <a href="http://www.nist.gov/data/PDFfiles/jpcrd276.pdf" target="_blank">300C</a> via this option.</p>
<p>All that being said, I don't know what would happen to water in zero g. I don't want to speculate, and I'm not even sure how the bubbles would move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you really mean uniformly, it wouldn't boil. This is why microwaving a still glass of water can superheat it without boiling. If you then break the symmetry by sticking a spoon in, it will suddenly boil. Needs some symmetry breaking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
