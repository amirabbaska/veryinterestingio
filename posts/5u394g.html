		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's loads of technology. The old fashioned and cheap (still used where possible) method is cut and cover. Dig a big trench, build the tunnels and then cover them up. </p>
<p><a href="http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/55e6/131f/2347/5dc8/6100/001a/large_jpg/cut-and-cover-tunnelling-for-metropolitan-railway_1861.jpg?1441141528" target="_blank">Here's them doing it in 1861, London for what is now part of the tube</a></p>

<p>However, for digging under buildings  and such there's another technology - tunnel boring machines. </p>
<p><a href="http://74f85f59f39b887b696f-ab656259048fb93837ecc0ecbcf0c557.r23.cf3.rackcdn.com//assets/library/image/1/original/17448_crossrail_tunnel_boring_machine_fully_assembled_12_dec_20121.jpg" target="_blank">Here's one of the TBMs used in the newest London underground expansion, Crossrail</a></p>
<p>They're basically giant worms pushed by hydraulics. The front head turns slowly, grinding the ground in front. Conveyor systems carry the sludge away. <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oF181FMiEK0/VXjvj5IaR2I/AAAAAAAAIeg/i6Ye__b2Pkc/s1600/IMG_4653.JPG" target="_blank">Little trains</a> bring precast concrete tunnel segments, which are placed against the wall and bolted in place by a giant robot arm. </p>
<p>This is pretty efficient, provided the ground is stable. Unfortunately, many large cities are built on river basins or other flat, muddy ground. This requires more advanced techniques. </p>
<p>Back in the day (eg Paris metro) they used to freeze the ground by pumping cold liquid through pipes that they pushed in. Then they could excavate a tunnel and build walls before the ground started to melt.</p>
<p>A more modern technique is to use a Earth-Pressure-Balance TBM. If you just use a regular TBM ground will just fall down in front of the cutting head, causing a sinkhole above the TBM.</p>
<p>In a EPB TBM the cutting head is kept pushed hard against the tunnel head, so that the ground doesn't start caving in. The front of the TBM is sealed, linking seamlessly with the tunnel lining (built from those concrete segments) that the TBM is always assembling as it moves along. </p>
<p>Subway tunnels are pretty well mastered nowadays. The main issue is cost control. In the US you're looking at $200-1000 million a km! (Yes, a million dollars a <em>meter</em>). Spain on the other hand has managed to build subway systems well below $100 million/km. This is mostly a management/legal problem. </p>
<p>Other tunnels can be more difficult though! Highway tunnels are much bigger, so cause more problems. A recent example would be Seattle where the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement tunnel caused sinkholes to open in the city, or Boston's Big Dig which cost billions upon billions above predictions. </p>
<p>There's always new innovations as well. One big one is the New Austrian Tunneling method (which is really a collection of good practices) which is particularly applicable in hard rock. This basically uses pretty standard-looking earthworking equipment, the top half of the tunnel is dug first, the rocks natural strength holding up the tunnel. Then spray-concrete is thrown on the roof. </p>
<p>After that the second team comes through and digs out the bottom half, concreting that as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very carefully.  </p>
<p>There are big drills that chew rock very slowly, deposit it onto a conveyor belt that takes it out of the tunnel.  Right behind them is a similar machine that lays some brand of concrete, reinforcing mesh, and usually a polymer coating.  </p>
<p>At no time is more than a very little bit of the tunnel exposed without reinforcement.  The whole process goes very slowly, and only really vibrates at the surface entrance/exit, which is usually in an industrial area anyway.  </p>
<p>Basically, we know the math behind the forces that would ruin existing surface structures, and make sure we don't do that.  Or if it's unavoidable, you design for the outages too, and build repairs into the budget.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have described how it's practically done already, but I thought I'd add why it works and why it doesn't fall down after you drill.</p>
<p>The structures above are generally large, so their weight is distributed over a large area. So when you drill, in front of the drill you obviously have the ground intact and still holding up the ground above, and behind the drill you place concrete asap to hold up the tunnel. So you have the little piece in between, right where the boring machine is, as long as the buildings above are distributing their weight over more than that area, you shouldn't really have a problem. Furthermore, through the earth the lifting power of the concrete and the earth on the sides of the tunnel is also distributed - somewhat like an arc. So it's providing some lifting power to building right above the uncovered hole as well.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Both the weight and the forces keeping them up are distributed a lot horizontally, so the relatively small tunnel roof of unsupported earth with all the buildings above (usually) doesn't fall down on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently working on a project just like this!  The tunnel will be about 4 miles long, 2 feet in diameter and be used for stormwater overflow, basically a giant reservoir 200 ft below our state capitol.  </p>
<p>Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) are amazing.  You can view a video of how they work here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_EjMlLgqY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_EjMlLgqY</a>.  They drill, place the walls of the tunnel and move the rock out all in one device.  </p>
<p>Before the project was started, samples of the soil and rock were collected along the pathway.  This way the soil/rock types can be anticipated.  Surveys to make sure there are not potential obstructions are also done (Bertha, a TBM got stuck in Seattle and it was quite a saga! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(tunnel_boring_machine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(tunnel_boring_machine</a>))  Some easements and purchases of land were necessary because our state says you own your land down to the center of the earth (ok, maybe not, but you get the idea).  </p>
<p>Surveys have been performed and will be regularly checked to make sure vibration does not cause damage, but the contractor tells us that folks have no clue what is happening under their feet.  I've seen other forms of horizontal drilling and can say that has been true with those methods, although they are much smaller.  </p>
<p>For our project, there is a launch and retrieval shaft, both of which required access to the surface, as well as multiple small sites along the way for small vertical shafts for air &amp; odor control.  Those sites are small and mostly take advantage of existing sites the towns along the way already own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
