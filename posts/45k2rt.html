<p>Making your skin cells think – researchers create mini-brains from donated skin cells. It sounds like science fiction, but ten years ago Shinya Yamanaka’s lab in Kyoto, Japan, showed how to make stem cells from small skin donations. Now my team at Johns Hopkins University is making little brains from them, modeling the first two to three months of brain development.</p>
<p>These cell balls are very versatile – we can study the effects of drugs or chemicals. This promises treatments for diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer or Multiples Sclerosis. But also the disturbance of brain development, for example leading to autism, can be studied.</p>
<p>And we can create these mini-brains probably from anybody. This opens up possibilities for personalized medicine. Cells from somebody with the genetic background contributing to any of these diseases can be invaluable to test the drugs of the future. Take autism – we know that neither genetics nor exposure to chemicals alone leads to the disease. Perhaps we can finally unravel this with mini-brains from the skin of autistic children? They bring the genetic background – the researchers bring the chemicals to test.</p>
<p>And the mini-brains are actually thinking. They fire electrical impulses and communicate via their normal networks, the axons and neurites. The size of a fly eye, they are just nicely visible. Most of the different brain cell types are present, not only various types of neurons. This is opening up for a more human-relevant research to study diseases and test substances</p>
<p>We’ve started to study viral infections, but stroke, trauma and brain cancer are now obvious areas of use.</p>
<p>We want to make available mini-brains by back-order and delivered within days by parcel service.  Nobody should have an excuse to still use the old animal models.</p>
<p>And the future? Customized brains for drug research – such as brains from Parkinson patients to test new Parkinson drugs. Effects of illicit drugs on the brain. Effects of flavors added to e-cigarettes? Screening to find chemical threat agents to develop countermeasures for terroristic attacks. Disease models for infections. The list is long.</p>
<p>And the ultimate vision? A human-on-chip combining different mini-organs to study the interactions of the human body. Far away? Models with up to ten organs are actually already on the way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Thomas. I'm curious whether you have glial cells in the mix, and specifically whether you account for microglia? Since they're created in the yolk sac and not derived from the same source as neurons and other glia, it seems like it would be very difficult to incorporate them, but it would be difficult to understand neurotoxicity and even early development without them as their absence lead to improper regulation and connectivity of neurons.</p>
<p>If they're there, I'm super curious what specific cells they're being created from (Langerhans macrophages?) and how easy it is to get them to populate the brain.</p>
<p>If you do not account for them, does your model suggest anything interesting through their lack of presence?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Hartung, </p>
<p>Thank you for doing this AMA! I have a few questions: </p>
<p>1) In your system, how do you know that the connections being made/networking/spine formation/etc. are comparable to those made in the brain? If so, could your system be used to study things like developmental neurobiology (I know that there's some thought that pruning issues during development might be one of the causes of Autism-spectrum type phenotypes.) Additionally, do you think your system would be a good model for learning and memory/neuroplasticity? </p>
<p>2) Does your system contain an analog to glia/microglia/other non-neuronal cells that are contained in the brain? Even though glia aren't electrically active, they contain such amounts of things like glutamate that they're incredibly important for normal, tonic neuronal activation. </p>
<p>3) What is the advantage of your system over primary neuronal cultures, or over expressing relevant receptors in a  heterologous system? Your system sounds incredibly impressive for <em>in vivo</em> work, but wouldn't the higher volume/higher throughput capabilities of heterologous system be more efficient for things like drug screening? </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to do this! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
