From that speed you could calculate the lag depending on how far the light travels from one mirror to the other. The calculation would look something like:</p>
<p>(distance from you to the mirror in meters + average distance the light travels from mirror to mirror in meters x (999,999))/(3 x 10^8 m/s) = _____ seconds of lag</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And something similar was actually used in 1848 to measure the speed of light. Although it only used one mirror*:<br />
A light was aimed through the teeth of a cogwheel to a mirror a couple of km away at roughly the same position as the light there was an observer. When the wheel was not moving the light went from between the teeth of the wheel across a distance, bounced off the mirror, traveled back across the distance and between the teeth of the wheel to end up being seen by the observer. Now, when the cogwheel started spinning, there was a certain speed at which the returning light had taken enough time to now meet a tooth instead of a gap. If the wheel was sped up the light met a gap again and was observable again. With knowledge of the experimental geometry (distance, cogwheel size and number of teeth) and the rotational speed of the cogwheel, the speed of light could be calculated to within 0.6% of the modern value.  </p>
<p>*some simplifications (there were actually two mirrors.. );  </p>

<p>Edit: the accuracy was actually about within 5% of the modern value. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The only question is whether that delay is long enough for you to perceive it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what the others said, mirrors aren't perfect. First off they absorb part of the light (a tiny part, but noticable if there are a million), but they also reflect some photons at less than perfect angles because they aren't perfectly smooth, and slightly change the color, depending on what it's made of and how pure it is. After a million mirrors, the image could be noticably distorted and tinted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply said, yes.</p>
<p>Of course, it depends on the number and distance of the mirrors.</p>
<p>Let's say the mirrors are 1 meter apart. The speed of light in air is about 299,700 km/s. If you have 1,0000,000 mirrors, the distance a photon travels around the mirrors is then 1,000,000 m or 1,000 km. The light would take about 3 milliseconds to reach the last mirror. </p>
<p>Since the human visual system can not distinguish time scales as small as this, it will seem instantaneous to you.</p>
<p>Apart from this, you will probably not be able to see yourself in the last mirror anyway, because if the mirror is flat, your image will look like it is 1,000 km away, and each mirror will absorb a tiny portion of the light, so not much will come back to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
