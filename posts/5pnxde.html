		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While hard keys like keyboard keys get produced one by one, the rubber keys of remote controlls are all made in one step. those rubber buttons are on one big pad per remote control so they are produced pretty fast and they are cheap. old cellphones do have the same kind of buttons. the drawback of those rubber buttons is that you cannot type as fast as with keyboard keys, but because u dont need to be as fast as that it is no problem. also  the stupid humans would never recognize that they get fucking cheap remote controlls instead of high quality products</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cheaper and easier to produce.</p>
<p>This style of button has a plastic membrane, which when pushed down, completes the circuit and registers a button press. There isn't a physical button component soldered on for each button. </p>
<p>A keyboard has more tactile buttons because it feels better to type on, however you can get cheap keyboards with the same type of buttons as a remote.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something not mentioned is that they also do a pretty good job of waterproofing the switches.  Because all the switches are usually on a single sheet of rubber, random splashes of water don't penetrate into the unit as much as they would with discrete keys.</p>
<p>In fact, while the emphasis ITT seems to be cost, in reality I'd argue that the real reason is because it's a brilliant bit of design.
You can pull it apart and clean the contacts easily, and in the worst case scenario where the conductive pad is worn, you can even paint on new contacts.   </p>
<p>If I was purchasing a 20 year old second hand device with heaps of switches, I know which style I'd prefer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some have hard keys, like the harmony 880. The issues are they stop making connection quicker than a soft key setup because of the way they need to be built. Each button has a &quot;stick&quot; on the back of it which wears down or can become misaligned. Then that button stops working. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because remotes get dropped a lot, and many people have wood or tile floors? Hard keys might snap off and get lost, or break entirely.</p>
<p>Source: watch a fair amount of TV, have hardwood floors, drop remote frequently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
