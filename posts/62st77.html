		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Man some of these responses are way off base.</p>
<p>First, there's nothing in physics that says you can't have a perpetual motion machine. You just can't extract any energy from it and have it move forever, because whatever you're using to create energy will add resistance to the system. A perfectly frictionless pendulum will have perpetual motion. You can also go into deep space and spin a drumstick like a rock star and that will spin forever (unless act on by another force of course).</p>
<p>In your example, even if you ignore friction and air resistance, you wouldn't have perpetual motion. This is because of something called an eddy current. When you have a conductor moving through a magnetic field, a current develops that creates a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the existing field. The magnets in your example both create the magnetic field and act as conductors. Thus, as soon as you start spinning the magnet, the eddy current will create a magnetic field to counter that movement and stop the motion. Eddy current braking (as it's called) is used as a brake in electric motors, such as in your power drill. </p>
<p>My guess for what would happen in your example is you give the magnet on a string an initial push, it stops almost immediately and bounces around on the string until finding its equilibrium in the repelling magnetic field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It won't swing in circles. It will find the point where all the forces are cancelling eachother out and stop.</p>
<p>But even if it would swing forever, you still won't get any energy from it as it will cause it to stop. The best case scenario is getting the same amount of energy back as you put in when you first set it in motion.</p>
<p>There's nothing spectacular about making something go forever, just look at the planets orbiting the sun. But this doesn't mean that there's an infinite amout of energy to extract. Any energy you take out of the system will cause the objects to slow down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
