		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beekeeper here. I assume you mean honeybees (apis mellifera ligustica, carnica, etc)</p>
<p>Hives are known to experience &quot;drift&quot;, where bees change colonies. This can happen to both workers (female bees) as well as drones (male bees), moreso with the latter. </p>
<p>This happens for a number of reasons. Bees have a range of two miles and do much of their extracolonial travel visually, using landmarks, so it's often speculated that they become lost or confused and end up someplace else. They are often exhausted from their travels, so we can speculate that they may just collapse to another hive in an act of self preservation, unusual for a &quot;superorganism&quot; that relies on strict cooperation!</p>
<p>So let's talk about socializing. It's well known that a honeybee can make an &quot;offering&quot; to the guards at the entrance of another hive, by regurgitating nectar from their crop, thus bribing the guards who would normally stop other bees. They are then tagged with the scent profile of that hive - like a lot of the pheromone properties in the hive, this part is loosely understood. </p>
<p>Often, honeybees going from one hive to another are robbing. This happens when there's enough honey for another colony's scouts to smell. The attacking colony will send scouts who attempt to overwhelm the guards and rob out the honey stores of the other hive. This usually happens when the robbed colony is weakened, either from queenlessness or disease.</p>
<p>Drifting, however, is different, and represents an interesting behavior among bees. Some people believe it's a vector for disease, which it probably is, but the below study indicates that it's probably not that big of a factor. I think it's just a species preservation behavior. Think human travelers moving from town to town and getting in good with the guards at the gate before being let in. We do it because it just makes sense. Why not invite in some extra hands (or in the case of bees, extra claws)?</p>

<li>&quot;Colony evaluation is not affected by drifting of drone and worker honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) at a performance testing apiary&quot;   Peter Neumann Robin Moritz Dieter Mautz <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00891701/" target="_blank">https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00891701/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting note besides socialization: the Cape honeybee (Apis mellifera capensis) is a subspecies from far southern Africa, originating in a specific coastal region. They have a special faculty, thelytoky, which allows them to lay an egg that is essentially a clone of themselves. This allows them to perform much more effective supercedures (queen raising ) than, say, the european honeybees, who need to raise a queen from an egg already deposited in the hive if there's an emergency or they lose a queen. European honeybees can only produce unfertilized drones, meaning a colony of the european bees without a Queen or eggs will perish.</p>
<p>Well this Cape honeybee, should it infiltrate another hive, such as those of African honeybees (apis mellifera scutelleta), can wreak havoc by laying clones of itself. Those clones hatch and then make clones of themselves. In short order, they overcome the latent genetics in the hive.  This has been a menace for many beekeepers in Africa, because Cape honeybees are ill suited to life outside the Cape region.</p>

</ul>
<p>/u/niandralades2 brings up a great point here, that species preservation is not a good explanation for drifting behavior: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4odwzk/do_bees_socialize_with_bees_from_other_hives/d4cxpwv" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4odwzk/do_bees_socialize_with_bees_from_other_hives/d4cxpwv</a> We talk about it a little bit there.</p>
<p>/u/RosesFernando brings in some information about the wax (a lipid) retaining the scent of the hive, as well as giving some sources on relative aggressiveness of guards: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4odwzk/do_bees_socialize_with_bees_from_other_hives/d4cptzd?context=3" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4odwzk/do_bees_socialize_with_bees_from_other_hives/d4cptzd?context=3</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Satoyama_Will describes interaction of <em>apis mellifera</em> well, however there are other bees that have a different interaction. The <em>Meliponini</em> or stingless bees are social like the western honey bee and form small hives of few hundred or thousand individuals.  Some species of <em>Meliponini</em> in Central America and Australia are managed by bee keepers and produce honey that people collect. At least one species in Central America has a mother daughter relationship among hives. A new hive is not founded like it is in honey bees where a large portion and an old queen fly off to found a new hive on their own but instead is slowly built up over time by workers and after some time a new queen migrates over to the daughter hive. Contact is maintained between the two hives after establishment. </p>
<p>I can't give much more all this came from a lecture given two years ago at Florida's Bee College given by one of the grad students, originally from Central America who raised these bees. Bee college a 3 day event conducted by the <a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/honeybee/" target="_blank">UF honey bee lab</a>. For more info it would be best to contact the lab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Hive internal working is due to pheromones. Bees can recognise a bee from another hive due to the fact that they smell differently. The two most prominent cases of interaction between bees of different hives are during robbing, and during hive relocation.</p>
<p>Robbing is when the bees of one hive decide to steal honey from another hive. The trigger for this is generally an open hive (e.g. due to a wild animal or weather topping the hive) or a particularly weak colony. During robbing, bees will try to enter the other hive but the guard bees will try to repel them. A lot of fights will also happen in flight. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSXJLfG-hA0" target="_blank">A robbing event is not a pleasant sight</a>. There are ways to prevent or minimise the robbing behavior, and <a href="http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/files/147611.pdf" target="_blank">are part of the well established precautions of the trade</a>.</p>
<p>The other case when bees can interact is when the beekeeper moves hives around. This can be either on purpose or by accident/inexperience. The end result is however that bees from a different hive are generally accepted into the hive if they carry pollen. If not, they are repelled. Once in, they become part of the accepting hive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a beekeeper in training! While its perfectly normal to have multiple hives right next too each other Bees from different hives don't normally get along. That's not to say they seek each other out and fight but there is definitely interaction between them. </p>
<p>In fact bees are even known to rob each others hives! The thing about bouncer bees is sorta true. Every hive has a few guards that sit outside and look tough. If they see a robber bee they normally will defend themselves by bunching it and taking it out.  They definitely don't let just anyone in, especially not just to eat honey.  They need the extra supply to survive the winter!</p>
<p>There's also tons of diseases that are spread hive to hive this way as well.  Although often that's indirectly.</p>
<p>Its also possible to sometimes combine hives provided the brood is young enough to accept a new queen.  It can be kinda risky to attempt mind you but its doable. For example my class just moved a bunch of drone eggs from a dieing hive to a new one to help beef it up  a bit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm reminded of a story i heard on the joe rogan podcast where he talked about this one time when working on Fear Factor he had a beekeeper there with his colony of bees for a stunt, and out of nowhere a local colony of bees showed up and his colony flew into the air and essentially started &quot;talking&quot; to the other colony</p>
<p>joe asked the beekeeper &quot;what we do?&quot; and he said &quot;nothing. we just have to let them sort it out&quot;</p>
<p>in other words the bees were actually somehow communicating/explaining that they weren't looking to fight and were not looking to take over or whatever and thus after 20 minutes or so two colonies just went their separate ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
