<p>I've been reading about Dr. Herculano-Houzel's <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2014.00077/full" target="_blank">brain soup</a> method after following some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/magazine/to-unlock-the-brains-mysteries-puree-it.html" target="_blank">popular science articles</a>. It appears that in various brain structures, the mass-to-neuron ratio for primates deviates from other groups of mammals and presumably that is at least one factor which causes increased cognition (though I could be wrong, so please let me know if so!). Why should that be the case?</p>
<p>As a side question, have any studies been done on other mammals such as whales and dolphins? A quick google search didn't yield anything in that realm.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009/full</a></p>
<p>Basically, primates have more neuron-dense brains than other animals.  A cow and a chimp have similar sized brains, but the chimp has a heck of a lot more neurons.   Since neurons are the cells that do the actual computation in the brain, it makes sense that they'd be directly related to intelligence...so denser neurons may explain why primates are so smart.</p>
<p>This difference in neuron density is especially notable as brains get bigger, and while (as of the writing of the paper above) information wasn't available on whale and elephant brains, it's entirely possible that human brains actually have <em>more</em> neurons than they do, despite their much larger brains.  </p>
<p>Historically people have postulated all sorts of  reasons why some animals  (particularly humans) are more intelligent...looking at brain size, brain-to-body size, brain structure, size of particular brain structures, etc.  But these have all been imperfect measures.  It'd be interesting if it winds up that we can just put intelligence mostly down to &quot;number of neurons&quot; ...a factor that was previously obscured by the fact that the relationship between &quot;number of neurons&quot; and &quot;brain mass&quot; can differ quite a bit between groups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to mention that I met Dr. Herculano-Houzel while in grad school, she was really cool.  Her lab's work is really interesting, and also has provided the evidence for why the brain folds the way it does in some animals, like primates (its due to a combination of skull size and increased neurons/thickness of the grey matter, if I remember correctly).</p>
<p>I think u/atomfullerene answered your question well, and the link provided has some info regarding whales (I saw table 3 making comparisons with the false killer whale).  Dr. Herculano-Houzel has several in-depth review papers on topics like this, check some out if you are [interested.] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=herculano-houzel+review" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=herculano-houzel+review</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.</p>
<p>Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess. You'll also have a higher brain/body ratio, so you get that cognition/ratio correlation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>connectivity of the brain is critical. the frontal lobe receives and sends projections to/from the vast majority of the brain as well as subcortical structures. our (as humans and secondarily as primates) relatively massive PFC seems to enable a lot of our higher order cognition, partially because it is apparently quite plastic but also because of the diverse info it can receive, process and use for mental and motor output. obviously with higher numbers of neurons you have the potential for greater synapse numbers but its the structural complexity and streamlining of the connections you do have that probably matter more. in fact, in the PFC we see a decrease in gray matter with age into the 20s and 30s which is thought to represent synaptic pruning, or removal of redundant connections and fortification of efficient ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
