		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon of ringing in the ears is called tinnitis.  It is not normal and can be caused from disease, head injury, or earwax, for example.  The most common cause is hearing loss, and is your brain adapting to the loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times you can hear noises/things in a silent room that you can't hear while awake and surrounded by all the other stimuli in life. They might be outside noises, electrical buzzing, or sometimes your own blood flow in your inner ear canal. Tinnitus is a pathological ringing that is not normal. </p>
<p>I sat in an audiology sound deadened room the other day at work and couldn't hear anything at all, the silence was creepy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there,
I used to be a sound engineer and then a hearing aid repair guy for a few years after so here's my input anyway. It may be tinnitus, but just to be sure, check your electronics in your quiet room, It could be a telly or a power adapter or something as well.  You could try unplugging everything and seeing if you still hear it, you'd be amazed the noises some of these things can make. Also if the noise goes away after while on its own then its an effect  being around too much noise during the day and your ears are readjusting, as someone else mentioned in the comments (You should still take precautions if this is a regular occurrence). If however it doesn't go away you should look at making some adjustments, like turning your headphones down, or wearing earplugs if your workplace is too loud etc..
Tinnitus is in fact repairable to a certain degree, but if the damage to your ears does go too far, it can be irreversible and cause you a lot of trouble in the future.</p>
<p>So TLDR theres no need to panic, but you should start looking after your ears</p>
<p>Hope this helps you</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a medical professional, but my best guess would be that your ears are acclimating to the silence (relatively...it's never completely silent). You're bombarded daily with a cacophony of noise and when it suddenly goes away, your brain is trying to makes sense of the lack of sensory input. Another idea might be just the blood flow in your ears, like when you &quot;hear the ocean&quot; in a sea shell. Since there isn't something to amplify it, you just get a general wall of unidentifiable sound. I think another thing to consider is the fact that most of us live in close proximity to many different electronic devices. They make noise, albeit small noises. Even the lights themselves make noise. When the power goes out in your home, you hear that 'pop' and a sound like the noise draining from the house, everything powering down. You may hear the &quot;silence&quot; of electrical static in the background. Just a few thoughts though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
