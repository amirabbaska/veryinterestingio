		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a ton of over complicated explanations and arguing over the relatively simple design of household AC circuits here. There is a very simple answer to this. </p>
<p>In North America, the wider prong was added as a safety feature to ensure the neutral was connected where its supposed to be. Some appliances have relatively exposed connections that are intended to to be wired to the neutral, rather than the hot wire, <em>for safety reasons</em>. There's no functional difference - the appliance will work either way - but it's safer to have the neutral terminal exposed.</p>
<p>An example is a table lamp. The bulb connection for the hot leg is fairly concealed and you'd have to deliberately jam your fingers in there to touch it. The bulb connection for the neutral on the other hand is the socket shell that the bulb screws into, and the second you put the bulb in, the metal on the bulb also becomes part of the circuit (whereas the hot isn't connected until the bulb is screwed in to the bottom of the three socket.) </p>
<p>With the neutral connected to the shell, this doesn't matter. The neutral in modern homes is connected directly to the ground reference - the same as the ground wire, and all your electrical boxes, and most of your appliance frames, etc.</p>
<p>If you remove the wider prong from the connection, you can now connect the hot leg to the neutral connection by plugging it in backwards, and that largely exposed metal socket (and the metal on the bulb) now has 120VAC on it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electric equipment used to have a dedicated ground wire to protect the user from shock, some still do. This ground wire was connected to the housing of the component to provide an easier path to ground to protect the user from shock. The two wire system uses a housing electrically insulated from the user usually by plastic. With this system it is much more important that the nuetral wire remains the nuetral wire and is not switched so it was made bigger so it can't be plugged in backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Live is the wire that is ultimately connected to one of the phases at the generator making the electricity. Since that generator produces alternating current the live wires voltage potential compared to the neutral of the generator (and earth) will vary between minus 170v and 170v, 120 is the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) value. The neutral has zero potential compared to ground or neutral.<br />
The bottom line is that touching the live is dangerous.<br />
Devices are designed with this in mind, that the live and neutral are on specific prongs, light fixtures e.g. have the live at the bottom so that only the small bottom lead would be live if the circuit were left energized.  </p>
<p>*Edit
Fixed voltage after /u/whitcwa et others corrected me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm studying to become an Electrician in Sweden and some of the comments seem very strange, so I feel like I should chime in.</p>
<p>First of all, yes, you can connect it in both directions and it will work, and I believe most AC plugs used around the world work this way.</p>
<p>But you shouldn't, as it's supposedly a safety feature. Like others have said, there is a difference between the two wires which may make one dangerous and not the other. Of course, electricity is never that simple. Fun examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you touch the wire called &quot;phase conductor&quot; (dangerous one) then you'll get the same potential as it, but if you're not well enough connected to ground then no current will flow and it will not be dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, if you touch the wire called &quot;neutral&quot; (not dangerous one) and you are already connected to something with potential (because of some other device failure, which actually gave you potential like the above example, but didn't hurt you.. yet) then current will flow through you and it will be very dangerous. (Also, if your installation is not grounded properly then the neutral could have a potential compared to the ground.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can still argue that one is more dangerous than the other, but what does that have to do with the direction of the plug? There is actually a reason to make it this way IF you want to allow devices to have one &quot;wire&quot; exposed. If I make a lamp fixture out of metal, then I can make it a bit cheaper if I can run electricity through part of the fixture itself, and if I know one of the wires is always the neutral one then I can do this with that &quot;wire&quot;.</p>
<p>Personally, I would say this is less of a safety feature and more of a &quot;make the cheap way less dangerous&quot; feature. In the EU (I don't know about the US) devices have to have a &quot;second shell&quot; which does not normally conduct electricity. This shell (if it's conductive) has to be connected to the wire called &quot;protective earth&quot; (a third wire) (for old installations this connects to neutral at some point) so that a dangerous faulty device can cause a short circuit which will blow the fuse and cut off the power.</p>
<p>Additionally, electrical installations (except old ones) have to have &quot;residual current devices&quot; which detect when electricity flows out from the installation (through you) and will cut the power before you're actually hurt. These are safety features.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It's important to connect it the right way because certain assumptions have been made to cut down on costs, which means connecting it the wrong way could be dangerous even though the device should work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question comes up pretty often - and the thread is usually entertaining to me....</p>
<p>Anyway - as for a why, or how would a polarized plug be safer, consider this relatively common scenario.</p>
<p>A basic appliance, like a lamp with it's own switch.</p>
<p>As has been discussed, the Neutral prong ( the wider one) - is BONDED to ground, typically in the main circuit panel.  So in theory, the neutral wire is at or near &quot;ground potential&quot;.</p>
<p>Also - appliances typically have all of their metal elements connected to ground or sometimes neutral, or in the case of a lamp, it could be touching a grounded surface.</p>
<p>So - consider the appliance, it has it's own power switch, this switch ONLY disconnects one of the two wires, the &quot;Hot&quot; or live line.  The only way this system works safely is if you polarize the plug one way or another so the switch os always turning on/off the hot / live wire.   If the plug is reversed, then the lamp's frame and other parts may be connected to the HOT / Live line all the time and you are only connecting the neutral completing the circuit for the lamp when turning it on and off.   So it looks like everything is OK - the lamp works.. got it? ...</p>
<p>But the frame is energized all the time, so lets say you are touching earth, or a sink, or another grounded surface, and then touch the frame of the lamp - YOU have now completed the circuit from the hot / live line to ground...  ouchies..  or worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
