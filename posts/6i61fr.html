		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Android is just Android. It's the same operating system. Custom OS releases like Cyanogenmod/LineageOS use the same proprietary drivers that the manufacturer Android OS releases do. That's where most of the &quot;optimiziation&quot; occurs.</p>
<p>There are few differences at the end of the day. The big outliers are things like bloatware and custom software. If you load a device up with more software then it'll have to swap memory out on a regular basis, which is really really slow. Some manufacturers like Samsung also run their own custom UIs which are again often significantly slower than the stock Android UI. </p>
<p>And lastly keep in mind that this is Google's OS. Google puts in by far the most work. Any deviation from what Google does will generally be slower as Google has some of the best developers in the industry. What custom Android OS releases do is mostly provide a stock Google experience. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lol @ people saying custom roms are making significant device-specific optimizations.</p>
<p>The vast majority of apparent performance and battery life improvement comes from simply removing the carrier branded UI and replacing it with stock Android UI.</p>
<p>Most of the remainder from removing crappy apps that wake the phone up in the background that you could not otherwise remove (at least without root).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the custom small team stuff has significantly less compatibility or features than their big daddy's. Just like how you can make a car that goes faster than quite a lot of production cars by throwing a huge engine in almost any simple car frame/body, but thats because they are more luxurious, safer, handle better and have to comply to strict regulations.</p>
<p>In the case of software, specially things like Android as well, you're talking about a huge amount of devices it needs to work with, Google can't just say &quot;tough shit, your device is bricked&quot;, where as a custom developer can just say &quot;sorry, you're not supported&quot;.</p>
<p>Another example is how consoles frequently beat a PC <strong><em>with exactly identical specs</em></strong> because the developers are only developing, fine tuning and doing bug fixing on 1 single platform (per individual console) while developing for PC you have to make it work on the millions of different configurations out there, which is a difficult process that requires a significantly higher quality coding specification to ensure bugs don't get out of control, where as on a console everyone would have the same (within reason) bug, so you can just hard code an adjustment for it rather than fixing it which may well be harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like you're actually 5? </p>
<p>Lets pretend samsung is just now getting into the kid's wagon market. Their galaxy w wagon has tons of cool features like air bags, custom steel wheels/rims, speakers, a cooler, two big comfy seats, and undercarriage storage boxes for you to store things. Except, samsung doesn't actually manufacture the wagons all themselves. What they do is buy the classic radio flyer wagon, and add all those things on. You convince your little brother to pull you around in your fancy new wagon. But with all the extra weight from the added features (some good, others completely useless), your little brother can only pull you around so fast.</p>
<p>Then your best friend decides to just get a stock radio flyer, and bolt a folding lawn chair in it. When they get their little brother to pull them around (assuming both little brothers are equally strong), their little brother is going to be able to pull them around faster than your brother can pull you since they don't have all the extra weight.</p>
<p>The radio flyer is stock android, the features of your samsung wagon are touchwiz/other manufacturer ROMs, your friend's folding chair is a 3rd party ROM, and the little brothers are the phone hardware. Your friend didn't optimize a samsung wagon better than samsung did, they just didn't add as much extra stuff to the &quot;base&quot; wagon that would ultimately end up slowing it down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The team of engineers job isn't to make a super optimized ROM, it is to make a general purpose ROM that fits what marketing tells them to make, and to do it as quickly as possible- if they have any time left over to make performance optimizations, awesome, but it's not what they are focused on.</p>
<p>The after market developers often are catering to a specific crowd that is interested in performance, and they are often doing it on their own schedule for fun (or because that's what <em>they</em> want in a phone ROM, and they are more than willing to share the benefits of their work with like minded individuals)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
