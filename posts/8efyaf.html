		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former meteorology major here. Lightning requires high cloud tops for a greater electric potential. These higher clouds typically occur with more potential buoyancy, meaning warmer temps down below and colder temps at higher altitudes. More water vapor also increases the buouyancy of air, and allows clouds to grow larger. In warmer months there is a lot of water vapor for added buoyancy and cloud formation, and a lot of potential heat energy at the surface for massive updrafts. Due to the latent heat of all the water vapor, clouds can rise for miles and still be warmer than the surrounding air as they condense. In the winter however there is less water vapor, and way less buoyancy because the surface doesn't have nearly as much heat energy available. The rate at which a parcel of air would cool as it rises is too high (it would start sinking again as the air around it would be warmer) before it got remotely high enough to make a cloud that can produce lightning. </p>
<p>However, in rare conditions (this is starting to happen more frequently though with climate change), such as in snowstorms that have more moisture available, and with extremely cold temperatures aloft in some intense low pressure systems as well as lift caused by other factors, it can be below freezing at the surface and there is still enough buoyancy to make thunderstorms. Sometimes there is also a warm jet of moist air aloft that thunderstorms can grow on top of, while the bottom mile or so of an airmass is well below freezing, say if a shallow cold front came through. Warm rain can also fall into this cold air during a winter thunderstorm and turn into thundersleet, thundersnow, or graupel (soft hail). I've even seen a few winter snowstorms where there was large hail and heavy snow falling at the same time.</p>
<p>Hope this wasn't too dense but you get the idea :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meteorologist here, so lightning production is pretty complex and we are not 100% sure how it occurs, an atmospheric physicist would know a lot more than I, it may well have been proven exactly how it works in the last few years but most of my training hasn't involved that.
Most of the theories start with 'mixed phase' clouds, these are clouds that have both water vapour and ice crystals at the same time rubbing past each other. There's lots of interactions involving charge between the two but I dread to dive back into my atmo'physics notes as to the exact interaction theories.</p>
<p>Now you get this with clouds that start off 'warm'(above zero C) at the base and cool below zero as it rises quickly due to convection. So this usually means that the air below the cloud is warmer and as the snow and ice crystals fall through start to melt. (side track: It kinda does need to be a CB, at least it's been empirically tested that you need at least -20 c cloud top temps to glaciate, or trigger lightning, not 100% but that's the main value we use and would want to see regularly to pick a cell that is likely to produce thunder and lightning).</p>
<p>Anywho, This means you regularly have this mixed phase zone within rain showers but to get this with snow showers means the freezing level has to be within a certain range of the surface so that a) any snow doesn't melt, turning it to a rain storm. and b) Not so low as to limit this mixed phase zone. </p>
<p>There are other cases where you have supercooled water (sub-zero water but not ice). This could also play a part in thundersnow as you can still get supercooled water down to -15 C.  But I've not seen any conclusive paper on lightning formation. </p>
<p>In any case if an atmospheric physicist can add or correct any part of this I would welcome it as I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in my field. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thundersnow DOES happen in a really intense snow system.</p>
<p>Snow happens at cold temperatures </p>
<p>What is heat?</p>
<p>It is molecular activity!</p>
<p>So, the hotter it is, the more molecular activity</p>
<p>Higher molecular activity simply makes it more likely for lightning to occur than lower molecular activity. </p>
<p>Sooo while thundersnow CAN and DOES happen especially during intense storms and during the changeover from rain to snow, it is vastly more common in rain storms and more common in the tropics than the temperate regions and in the temperate regions it is far more common during spring rain than during winter rains </p>
<p>I have however been in a thunderstorm in Richmond Virginia at 10 PM on Christmas Eve</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
