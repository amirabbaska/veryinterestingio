<p>People did die from both, but /u/taylorschneider is correct that more likely , you would from something else sooner.</p>
<p>Or, you could die from both as an infant, and that would just be chalked up to the infancy mortality rate of the times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Shakespeare play (Hamlet maybe? It was one I've never studied) describes migraine - a character complains of a debilitating headache and another character comments that he simply needs to be sick to feel better (vomiting commonly helps in migraine).</p>
<p>There is also a reference in the Christian Bible that seems to be a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage. They describe a child complaining of a very strong headache, then expiring in his mother's arms.</p>
<p>My feeling is mirrored in a lot of the comments above, that common illnesses were likely to be swept up under vague groupings like frailty or poor constitution. It also helps that we're living longer with larger populations so these conditions are easier to identify. A basic understanding of genetics also goes a long way.</p>
<p>These conditions definitely would have existed in history, but we are constantly renaming and reclassifying diseases as we understand them better. A historical reference to a wheezy child could be &quot;childhood wheeze&quot; or an actual case of asthma, but we can't really pull up spirometry or salbutamol response results from 100AD.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have studied the spelling of Shakespeare, too.</p>
<p>As people have pointed out, the possible SAH is from Kings in the Old Testament. I can't think of a medical reason for the child to be revived by skin-to-skin contact, so I'll leave the resurrection bit as possible divine intervention/possible creative writing.</p>
<p>Vomiting helping with migraine is a common feature of migraines to the point of nearly being diagnostic. Unfortunately, migraines are one of our modern day 'poor constitution' or 'frailty' - in 200 years, someone will look back at our records and be all &quot;Holy crap, those 21st century folks were staring right at a case of Henderson Balls and had no idea! They just called it migraine!&quot; for some of the things we classify as migraine right now. So if vomiting doesn't help your migraines, you could fall under atypical migraines, or just have a case of Henderson's Balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>both asthma and diabetes are what are known in the trade as NCDs - non-communicable diseases. That is diseases not caused by infection (e.g. diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke).</p>
<p>Up until the mid 20th Century, the proportion of people dying from NCDs compared to people dying of infection was tiny, so it was under the radar for most people. Nobody cares about the old woman with cancer when half the village has been wiped out by the plague</p>
<p>Now NCDs, especially obesity related ones, are now the major killer of people in the developed world, people pay more attention to them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Early medical understanding simply referred to many of these specific illnesses under broader categories.  Descriptions such as ‘frail’, ‘sickly’ or ‘poor constitution’ were all many of these illnesses got called.  Most illnesses which tend to affect people later in life, such as cancer, were simply classed as the ravages of age.  </p>
<p>Many chronic health conditions have a high co-morbidity when combined with major infections.  Asthma when combined with the flu, and poor nutrition leads to pneumonia which tends to be fatal in children without antibiotics. </p>
<p>Type 1 diabetics become quite sick and often die without insulin.  Allergic reactions will be fatal at some point without insulin(edit: should say epinephrine) Especially during childhood.  </p>
<p>The infant mortality rates throughout history and even in modern day third world countries is very high.  Children with chronic illnesses simply died a lot.  Add in viral infections that we now immunize against and Darwin hits hard: only the strongest survive.  </p>
<p>Even things like good eye sight weren’t any more common in the past. Before prescription eyeglasses came along, plenty of people had vision problems, they simply didn’t know better, so it wasn’t recorded. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
