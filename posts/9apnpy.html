		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the muscles of your digestive system push food through the digestion process, the food gets broken down to be used by your body. In addition to the food and liquids that move through your digestive system, gas and air bubbles also get into the mixture.</p>
<p>It is these pockets of gas and air that make the sounds you know as stomach growling. They're not as loud when you have food in your stomach, because the food absorbs some of the sound.</p>
<p>When your stomach is empty, though, these sounds are much more noticeable. That's why we associate stomach growling with being hungry. A couple hours after you eat, your stomach sends signals to your brain to get your digestive system muscles working again.</p>
<p>This process cleans up any food that was missed earlier. The stomach muscle contractions also help to make you hungry, so you eat more food that your body needs. When these muscle contractions get going again and your stomach is empty, those gas and air pockets make a lot more noise that you hear as stomach growling.</p>
<p>There's actually a scientific word for the noises your stomach makes. It's called borborygmi after a Greek word (borborygmus) that's an onomatopoeia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Has no one given credit to Ghrelin? All the peristalsis which causes borborygmi is due to a Ghrelin cycle which usually fluctuates with your eating schedule or when youâ€™re just flat out hungry. Gastrin also has a play cause it signals the parietal cells (acid secreting cells) in your stomach to release gastric acid which helps helps when you take food but if no food arrives it can start to irritate the lining of the stomach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of peristaltic waves. Peristaltic waves are normal contractions of the gastrointestinal tract which help in churning and mixing of foods and cause the food to move along the passage aiding in digestion. This can occur even when your stomach is empty.</p>
<p>The sounds have been named as borborygmi.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comment basically covers it. Just wanted to add that peristalsis between meals is caused by something known as migrating motor complexes (MMC for short). For those who want to learn more, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrating_motor_complex" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> is a good place to start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About I year ago, I heard this weird noise. Like, &quot;Gr rr rrrrr rrrrroooooo&quot; coming from my body. Then a few minutes later, I heard it again, and realized it was coming from my stomach. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>About 15 minutes later, I'm like &quot;OK, my stomach isn't going to quit making that noise, I hope nothing is wrong with me.&quot; So I Googled &quot;Why is my stomach making weird noises.&quot; Then I read about how, when your stomach empties out, the noises it naturally makes get louder. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then I realized that I'm SO FAT that I literally hadn't heard my stomach rumble in YEARS because I'm ALWAYS EATING. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I wish I could say that this moment lead to life altering decisions, but let's just say I probably haven't heard my stomach rumble since then. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
