		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends if you are thinking about the production of the bottle or what will end up with the bottle after use. Overall, most people would probably agree that plastic bottles create a greater net negative environmental impact than aluminum cans.</p>
<p>So you've finished using your plastic bottle or aluminum can, and now you are going to recycle it - there is an environmental cost associated with recycling that bottle or can. One way to think about it is relative amount of energy saved through recycling. In the case of aluminum, recycled aluminum uses 95% less energy than extracting aluminum from raw ore, whereas plastic uses 76 to 90% less energy. So on a percentage basis, using recycled aluminum appears more efficient. (numbers from this science blog: <a href="https://sciencing.com/cost-recycle-aluminum-vs-plastic-24066.html" target="_blank">https://sciencing.com/cost-recycle-aluminum-vs-plastic-24066.html</a>)</p>
<p>Now what if the bottle or can is not recycled? The aluminum can can take a few hundred years to corrode and break down, but it will eventually break down, and assuming it was pure aluminum - won't really create any harmful byproducts in the process and while the can is sitting there it isn't really leaching any chemicals into the soil. </p>
<p>Plastic bottles on the other hand will decay, but might take upwards of 1,000 years to decay, and while they are decaying can release hazardous chemicals into the environment.</p>
<p>That being said, both plastic bottles or aluminum cans could have other environmental impacts, like ingestion by animals. In this case both types of container present a problem, but we might suspect that plastic bottles are causing more harm because, for example, in the ocean, they are clear and float, and so might be mistaken as a jellyfish (food source) by a sea turtle or sea bird. Plastic ingestion by animals is probably one of the biggest ecological crisis currently occurring - although a lot of that research is focused on microplastics instead of &quot;plastic bottles&quot; as asked about here: <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/ocean-life-eats-plastic-larvaceans-anchovy-environment/" target="_blank">https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/ocean-life-eats-plastic-larvaceans-anchovy-environment/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this helpful post. As a mostly uneducated consumer on this topic, I have often wondered the answer to this very question. My primary concern is which one causes the least environmental damage to the actual earth after it's thrown away, as I recently found out that even though my town collects my recycling, they don't actually recycle most of what I put in there. They just collect it and throw it in the same garbage pile with my other stuff, which is infuriating. So I'm trying instead to not add to the overall problem by spending my $$ on products that have the least negative impact on the earth to begin with. Considering these facts provided on this thread, would that be glass I wonder ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A more interesting comparison is can vs glass. In which case glass wins locally because it needs less energy but glass looses further away because of transporting the extra weight </p>
<p>But recycling just got turned on itâ€™s head, with China refusing to accept the worlds waste. That includes plastic bottles, so if aluminum gets remelted in country, it would automatically win.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
