<p>I'm afraid I don't know what you mean by this. An electron in an atom just sits there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does it mean that the electron appears at infinite positions around the atom or does it
just orbit the atom? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means that electrons aren't particles and they're not orbiting. They're wave-like phenomena being pulled inward by electrostatic force (they are negatively charged and the nucleus is positively charged, unlike charges attract). Like with any wave-like phenomena, be it in classical or quantum mechanics, when you try to confine or bind it you get certain resonant modes, like standing waves on a string, or a drum-head. These standing-wave states, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics" target="_blank">spherical harmonics</a>, make your &quot;orbitals&quot;. It is very important to understand though that &quot;orbitals&quot; aren't orbits. The naming is just a historical quirk (like &quot;conventional currents&quot; of a circuit being the wrong way relative to the actual physical motion of charge). Electrons aren't orbiting. In fact in something like an s-orbital an electron has no orbital angular momentum at all, there is no &quot;orbital rotational motion&quot;. The only way it changes in time is in something called its phase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also why does the electron not fall into the nucleus?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its state is dictated by two competing quantities: 1) its kinetics isn't dictated by motion or orbiting like a classical particle but but rather by a tendency to spread out and diffuse, like any wavey phenomena confined to a small region, and 2) the force of attraction it feels inwards confining it.  It can only adopt states where those competing requirements are simultaneously met (the fancy name is the &quot;eigenstates&quot; of the system).</p>
<p>EDIT: Fixed a rather embarrassing amounts of typos and grammatical errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was actually a fundamental question asked a century ago. The key is that you need to shelve your classical intuition and adopt a quantum framework.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, things are quantum mechanical objects called wavefunctions, which take on some value everywhere related to the probability of them being there. It’s not that they’re everywhere, it’s that it’s a fundamentally different kind of object for which that question doesn’t make sense (until it’s measured).</p>
<p>As for why electrons don’t spiral in, the electron is in a so-called “bound state.” In quantum mechanics, bound states will have quantized energies because, roughly speaking, their probability has to diminish at the place outside their boundary (this is very rough and imprecise language, but whatever), which restricts the standing wave solutions which are allowed to be in there.</p>
<p>Notably, this will cause a ground state with a minimum energy. The electron doesn’t fall to lower depths because there simply is no such state. This ground state corresponds to the lowest energy mode (lowest frequency); you simply can’t go below this, so you don’t spiral in).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
