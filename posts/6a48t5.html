		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sound waves that move like this</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<pre><code>
The sound waves are moving perpendicular to the ground. 

If the source is to your left, and your ear is to the right, then you'll hear the sound just fine. 

If we put a really thin wall between the two.

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~ 

You'll still hear the sound, the sound waves hits the wall, transfers the energy THROUGH the wall to the air on the other side, and you'll hear it. 

Now, a larger wall

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

You may still hear it, but it will be very faint, maybe you'll have to put your ear to the wall, that's because the sound wave have to move a much larger amount of mass to transmit the signal and they don't have as much energy. (This is very simplified)

Now, rather than a wall, you've got snow. 

If it's snowing lightly.

~~~~~~~~#~~~~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code>

The sound is just partially muffled from the snowflake interfering with the path of the sound wave, it absorbs some of the energy of the wave and it doesn't go as far. 

If it's snowing heavily

~~~~~#~~~~~#~~~~~~##~~~~

~~~~#~~~~~~#~~~~~#~~~~~#

~~~~##~~~~~#~~~~~~#~~~~~~#~~

The sound wave loses a lot more energy as it goes from the source to your ear. Making the sound less loud, and it won't travel as far. 

Edit: formatting, cause the snowflakes didn't work well.</code></pre></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels in waves yeah? Well sound bounces off of structures to get to places. Off of the ground, buildings, etc. When it snows it adds a layer of snow, which usually isn't packed tightly, so it doesn't reflect a lot of that wave back as well. It's like hitting a baseball with a wooden bat verses a pool noodle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sound energy as a tennis ball. If you drop it on a hard flooring(cement/tile) it almost bounces back with same energy. Now if you drop the same ball on a sand pit , it hardly bounces. This happens because in a hard flooring the particles are tightly packed. They don't move . So all the energy that the ball carries transferred back to the ball and makes it move in the other direction. On the sand the particles are loosely packed so the get to move . So a lot of energy is expended in moving sand particles and very little is transferred to the ball. </p>
<p>Something similar happens to the sound. When it snows the snowflakes are not tightly packed. So they can absorb more ambient noise compared to before snowfall. So it relatively feels quieter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While snow has some effect as a sound absorber, the fact that its snowing limits outdoor activities that adds to the affect. But once the storm is over, that loud and annoying sound of spinning tires and snow plows scrapping the pavement does not seem be hindered by the sound absorbing snow covered surroundings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When falling snow is actually building a wall between us and distant objects. You cannot see as far. But you are expecting to hear as far because sound does that. It comes around corners. But it is muffled. You might also be experiencing the reality that most physical activity outside stops when it snows. Shoveling can wait until it is over. Stay inside a chill out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
