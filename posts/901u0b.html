		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies are valued based on their potential future earnings, not based on their past performance. If Company X is chugging along making $10 million in earnings every year, we might for example value that company at $50 million, or roughly 5 years earnings (beyond 5 years we would heavily discount any earnings because there is a lot of uncertainty and earnings 5 years out are less valuable to investors today).</p>
<p>If all of a sudden Company X has a bad year and makes only $9 million in earnings, even though it is still profitable it is going to influence our entire valuation model. Best case we would now be valuing the company at $45 million ($9m x 5), but worst case we might suspect that there is a strongly negative trend with the company and yearly earnings will continue to decrease, further depressing the company's value. That is when investors start to panic.</p>
<p>Edit: Valuation methods vary from industry to industry and from firm to firm, and I did not mean to suggest 5-year earnings was standard. However, pretty much all valuation methods will be doing some form of discounting of future cash flows similar to what I described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A leaky boaty still floats, but that doesn't mean you have to wait until it is sinking to fix it.</p>
<p>In a healthy, expanding, inflationary economy, earnings should grow a little bit each year.  If they shrink, that can be a sign something is going wrong, something you want to try to fix before the company actually starts to lose money.</p>
<p>Also, most companies are investing profits into growth, opening new stores, increasing production, expanding to new product lines, thing than usually lose money for the first few years.  This is always a balancing act between growing fast enough to keep up with the competition and not growing so fast you become overextended.  Often reduced profits means they misjudged their growth strategy or the economy can no longer support it, and the way to correct that is scaling back the growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companys are ultimately only accountable to shareholders.  Shareholders only buy shares because they want to make money.</p>
<p>If a company makes less profit, the amount of money they pay shareholders for owning shares goes down.  This also means the value of the shares goes down.</p>
<p>This makes the shareholders angry.  They yell at the board and ceo, who yells at all the employees, and everybody gets very anxious and angry.</p>
<p>If the company cant stop their earnings getting smaller each year, the shareholders get so upset they sell their shares.  Because more people want to sell the shares then buy them, this makes the sharss worth even less.</p>
<p>Death spiral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies' value comes from roughly 10-20 years of earnings (so today people are buying and selling stocks based on their expectations of the company's earnings from now to 2028 or 2038).  Most of the time earnings are fairly precisely forecast for about 2 years, then a growth rate is applied.  </p>
<p>When a company announces earnings dropping by some amount, it usually means both less earnings now, but more importantly less earnings for the next two years of forecasts, and a growth rate that's closer to the inflation rate for the rest of the forecast.  Further, because earnings are one of the primary sources of corporate cash, reducing earnings expectations means the company will have less money to expand, develop products and other business activities.  </p>
<p>Because all these changes happen pretty rapidly after a disappointing earnings is announced, a tiny change now can mean a huge reduction in investors expectations for earnings over the next 10-20 years, which means the company's value can drop pretty dramatically.  </p>
<p>It's sort of like a huge ship turning a few degrees as it leaves port.  It's a small change now, but after the ship travels a few thousand miles, it means a large change in their ending location.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies are owned by investors.  Investors don’t look at the total profit of the company, they look at the % return on their investment.  </p>
<p>Making £1,000,000 is good if your investors put in £10,000,000 (10% a year), it’s terrible if they put in £100,000,000 (1% a year).</p>
<p>This is true for established companies, it’s a bit different for growing companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
