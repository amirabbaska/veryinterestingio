		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your tongue is covered with 2 types of taste proteins, receptors and ion channels, each of which have multiple subtypes.</p>
<p>The receptors have a pocket into which only certain molecules can fit, and when the receptor pocket interacts with one of these molecules, it is activated. The activated receptor then sends a signal into the cell that it is attached to, which gets translated into an electrical signal that moves to the brain, where it is interpreted as a taste.</p>
<p>Ion channels are similar, in that they send an electrical signal to the brain, but instead, these proteins just allow specific molecules to enter the cell which then activates the electrical signal.</p>
<p>Sweet, umami, and bitter use the receptors, salty and sour use the ion channels.</p>
<p>The important part is that each type of protein is VERY specific, meaning that they will only react to molecules that share similar chemical or physical properties. But as long as the receptor or channel is functioning, they will send the same signal to your brain. So, for example, if you eat white sugar or if you eat an apple, the type of sugar in each is different (glucose vs fructose), but they are both picked up by the same sweet receptor and so both of them will activate a sweet signal in your brain.</p>
<p>So pyrite tastes like table salt (who is eating pyrite?!) because they both work through the same channel proteins, and send the same flavor signal to the brain</p>
<p>What tends to give something its taste is that any given food releases multiple molecules which can be picked up by a combination of different receptors/channels</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have proteins on the surface of your tastebuds that are specified to bind to specific molecules such as salt, sugar, acids, bases, etc... when one of these proteins is bound by one of these tasty molecules, the protein's shape changes, signalling to other proteins, and ultimately to a nerve that there is salt/sugar/etc... in your food. Your brain associates that signal with a taste, and bingo, you can now enjoy doughnuts</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
