		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, this depends on the shape of the water.</p>
<p>When light moves from air to water or back, it bends (refracts) based on the angle it hits the water or air. Because a stream of water is round, the light bounces away from the stream when passing through it, leaving a shadow where the light didn't end up.</p>
<p>This is why the bottom of a pool is not in shadow: the light hits the top of the pool mostly straight, and so continues to the bottom. If it is refracted, it is all bends the same direction, so you still get an even amount of light at the bottom.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have ever seen a waterbug, or other lightweight object floating on the surface of a pool, you will notice they create round shadows where they touch the water. This is because they make &quot;dents&quot; in the water which bend the light away and leave a dark spot.</p>
<p>The opposite effect happens with light from air to glass: a magnifying glass concentrates the light by bending it inward.</p>
<p>TL;DR: light bends when it hits the water. If the shape of the water is round or curved, all the light bends away from the water, leaving a shadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can see water, so at least some light is being reflected. That light doesnt hit the surface behind the water, so it leaves a shadow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things combine for this: refraction and reflection</p>
<p>It's like how you see the ocean sparkle with light from the sun, some light is reflected away, even if it's clear. </p>
<p>Refraction redirects the light. Just like how a lens can focus light on one point, water will focus the light in random directions, since it is moving. The net effect of this leaves a little bit less light going directly through the water, since it is probably going to be interrupted at some point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A block of glass is transparent and won't cast much of a shadow. But a bunch of clear glass marbles will.</p>
<p>The steam that we see is water in a gaseous state condensing in air and becoming liquid again, forming tiny water droplets, like many tiny marbles. The same happens when a fountain sprays water.</p>
<p>Water acts like a prism. While it lets light through, it also changes its path slightly. Do this once (one big body of water, one big block of glass, etc) and the water appears transparent because the light's path is only changed a tiny bit. But do this many many times, and the many changes of the light's path lead to light being lost, creating a shadow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
