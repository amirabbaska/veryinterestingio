		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, the energy used to keep the train stable above the rails is small compared to the energy used to counteract drag. With an object as heavy as a train, how is this possible?</p>
<p>Edit: Since this thread has gone back and forth with different interpretations of the question, would anyone be willing to mathematically compare the amounts of energy required to accomplish the three goals of the maglev system (levitation, acceleration, and overcoming drag)? I think that would clear a lot of this up.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Now that more people have added their input, it looks like my initial assumption, that a continuous current requires a continuous input of energy, was wrong. The only energy required is the up-front energy to apply the initial voltage to the rails. After that, the circuit continues to run without the need for more energy. Thus, the only energy spent while the train is levitating (not including propulsion) is due to losses from resistance. With that in mind, and with the fact that no energy is required to suspend an object at a constant height, it makes sense that levitation is such a small portion of the energy used. As u/Wheed_O_Whirler pointed out, that amount is actually less energy than is used by the air conditioner. Thanks to everyone who helped explain that.</p></div></div>
