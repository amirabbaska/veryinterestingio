		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experimental models actually just armoured the rear of the blade but the idea was quickly dropped as the risk of ricochet was high and the blades,  even when armoured, couldn't resist many rounds.<br />
Next they developed a system where if a blade was in front of the barrel,  the weapon would not fire,  by blocking the trigger but this system was clunking and prone to failure.
Eventually they developed the system where the fire rate of the machine gun was synced to the RPM of the propeller; so it fired in between each blade. This was the most successful and common method of shooting 'through' the propeller. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used an interrupter gear. A simple cam system tracked the position of the propeller relative to the muzzle, and would prevent the gun from firing if the prop was in front of it. </p>
<p>Antony Fokker first pioneered this system in 1915 with his Eindecker monoplane. Prior to that, warplanes either had the gun mounted on top of the wing (above the prop), had a gunner, or the pilot simply used their side arm. All of which had their drawbacks. The top mounted guns in particular were difficult to reload. All were difficult to aim. There were experiments with armoured props, but these were quickly abandoned. </p>
<p>The front-centre mounted guns caught the Allies by surprise, leading to the Fokker Scourge during the summer of 1915. It basically gave birth to the dogfight overnight. German pilots could just point their plane where they wanted to shoot, and reloading was a breeze. The Entente powers quickly developed their own interrupter gear systems in response. It would become the standard for gun mounts from there forward.</p>
<p>By WWII, the system had fallen out of fashion for a variety of reasons. Guns were moved to the wings, or would actually fire through the nosecone (via a hollowed out drive shaft). The Messerschmitt  BF 109 and Yakovlev Yak 9 were the last notable fighters to fire through the prop arc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
