My bank only insures $250K ($500K for married couples... I think) per account. How does a company:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store so much cash? Like - physically store it. Where?</li>
<li>Insure so much cash?</li>
<li>Keep so much cash lying around? Isn't that better used invested somewhere and if it is invested, what vehicles allow such quick liquidity in a situation where you may just want to purchase a major network?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its much more complicated than this.</p>
<p>firstly theres no actual cash being stored anywhere, nor would any physical cash change hands in such a deal</p>
<p>when they say &quot;cash offer&quot; they just mean regular money in an account, and not any asset trading. </p>
<p>comcast isnt just keeping $60B in accounts sitting either. they likely have them invested in short term things or just stuff they can liquidate quickly. </p>
<p>all companies keep a stash of fairly liquid investments incase they need it. </p>
<p>comcast likely prepared and gatherered that amount of cash over time in preparation for their bid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Comcast only has about $5 billion in cash.  They secured bank commitments to provide loans to support their $60 billion offer for Fox.   The way this works is they hold confidential meetings with the banks to make sure the loans are available before announcing their bid for Fox.  Comcast has annual earnings of about $15B, so a $60B loan against that business is not all that absurd. So, if the Fox shareholders accept the Comcast proposal then the deal will close with Comcast's banks wiring $60B to the Fox shareholders, Comcast then owns all of Fox's shares and the combined company now has a $60B debt load that they will pay down by gouging you on Internet Access fees and selling your privacy data to Russia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not literally cash. It just means they have that much money that they can transfer to someone else. That's referred to as &quot;liquid assets&quot;. Assets they have that are not &quot;liquid&quot; would be things like real estate and equipment, or investments that are locked in and cannot be converted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Businesses do not keep that much money in cash. It is kept in bank accounts, normally multiple accounts. Much of it is also kept is stocks and other investments but liquidated when they want to make a major business purchase. It has also not been done quickly, these deals have been years in the making. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;All cash&quot; in this situation doesn't necessary mean all cash right now, and for large acquisitions it's much more common to be a combination of cash and debt (eg. $20B of cash on hand and $40 of secured senior notes issued for it). The &quot;all cash&quot; is just to differentiate it from a &quot;cash + equity (stock)&quot; offer in that Fox shareholders are receiving cash for their shares instead of stock in Comcast.</p>
<p>For company that do keep a lot of cash around, usually only what they need in the next month or two is actually kept as cash, and depending on the size of the company may be spread over many, many accounts in many territories. A lot of the rest is kept as &quot;cash equivalents&quot;, basically short-term, highly liquid investments that have very low risk to lose value, for example CDs, commerical paper, money market funds, treasury bills etc.  Many companies also keep a portion of their cash (especially cash that they think they won't need within a year) in longer term financial investments, which is usually classified as investments held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, depending on the type of financial instrument.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
