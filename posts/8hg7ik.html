		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is  thermal radiation. The thermal radiation that everything emits depending on temperature.</p>
<p>Glowing orange red is the lowest temperature that emit visible light. The hotter it gets the whiter it gets and even hotter it will look blue.</p>
<p>The light from a incandescent light bulb and the sun is black-body radiation but it is whiter at the temperature is hotter.</p>
<p>Thermal radiation it emitted at all temperatures but it has to be over approximate 798 K (525˚ C, 977˚ F)  to be visible. At lower temperature it is only infrared light and not visible.</p>
<p>The heat you feel radiate from hot object at lower temperature is thermal radiation but in infrared. But with special camera often called Forward looking infrared (FLIR) in militery application you can see the thermal radiation  from a human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It stems from something called &quot;black body radiation&quot; which was a &quot;hot&quot; topic in physics back in the day (pun intended). </p>
<p>Back in the 1800s, people were all into magnets and electrical fields and all that.  We have things called 'electromagnets' where you can use electricity to make a magnet and vice versa.  Turns out you can rig up a field so that it sort of self propagates, call that an electromagnetic wave.  Light, ultraviolet, X-rays, they are all electromagnetic waves, X-rays are high frequency (more energy), radio waves are lower energy, low frequency. </p>
<p>So you walk out in the summer sun, sun beams down some electromagnetic waves on your shirt, your shirt gets warmer.  Fair enough, right?  By symmetry though, if EM waves make your shirt warmer, then if I warm up my shirt with my body heat or a fire, ought to give off EM waves too right?  Absolutely. </p>
<p>Then it stands to reason, those higher energy EM waves like X-rays, those probably come off of hotter things. Hotter things are higher energy since they are hot, X-rays are higher energy since high frequency of EM waves. </p>
<p>In fact, you right now, being tepidly warm, you are giving off EM waves too, but you can't see them - called infrared waves.  We have cameras that can see them, IR cameras, like police use to catch people, body lights up.  If you get hotter, you spit out higher energy EM waves, now in visible light, you can see them, so now glowing orange - orange is right next to infra red, so this is the &quot;low energy&quot; part of visible light.  Get even hotter, now things look &quot;white hot&quot; because now it's a more even spread on visible light - you can use this to figure out the temperature of the sun. </p>
<p>But you don't give off light at one particular frequency, more like a range. Like even though you are mostly giving off infrared right now, maybe you give off a tiny bit of visible light, just not enough that it's possible to see it. So all those physics geeks in the 1800s, they did the math, found a problem called &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; - you give off a little visible light, a little UV light, a little X-ray light, then a little of something with a higher frequency, and a higher frequency, and so on, onto infinity - according to the math, we give off infinite energy!  But that's not true because conservation of energy. </p>
<p>Some physics nerd by the name of Max Planck took on this problem, he said, hey, maybe we don't just bleed off these energy waves, maybe they have to come in nice discrete little packets, call them photons, or little &quot;quanta&quot; of energy -&gt; quantum physics.  Turns out if you assume things bleed out in discrete packets, all that stuff about giving infinite energy goes away and energy is conserved again. </p>
<p>What you are getting at was very much the sort of thought experiment that lead to quantum physics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a piano, except it has a humongous keyboard which stretches from things that are too low and too high for you to hear. It's being &quot;played&quot; (or randomly whacked by a hyperactive child.)</p>
<p>The hotter an object is, the more the keys are being slammed, <strong>and</strong> more of the higher notes are being used.</p>
<p>This means as objects go from cool to ridiculously hot: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can't hear anything (no visible glow)</li>
<li>You hear a low rumble (reddish glow)</li>
<li>You hear some moderate noise (orange)</li>
<li>You hear more high-pitched stuff in the noise (yellow)</li>
<li>It becomes a blend of all low and high pitches (white)</li>
<li>It's painful to hear but simply gets louder without seeming to change after this point (oh God I'm going blind)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the atoms of the material gain heat (energy), electrons in the atom get excited and promoted to a higher electron shell because they have extra energy. The red glow is caused when the excited electrons return to their original, lower energy state and this energy is give off as red light because the energy gap between electron levels isn't high and red light is low energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
