		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other commenters have covered really well how it's still <em>transmitting</em>, so I'll cover a bit of how we're <em>receiving</em>. The signals Voyager transmits are really weak when they get here, and there's a lot of noise in the electromagnetic spectrum, so the signals are way weaker than the noise. &quot;But wait&quot; you might say, &quot;if the signals are weaker than the noise, how can we hear them?&quot; It's a challenge comparable to hearing your friend whispering from across a room full of people talking. We came up with a really clever way to hear them, though.</p>
<p>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise  signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how radioactive stuff is supposed to be radioactive for a long time, and radiation &quot;cooks&quot; things?  It turns out that if you take something that's really radioactive and has a long half-life, you can use that &quot;cooking&quot; to generate electricity for half a century.  This is called an RTG (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator), and Voyager 1 was launched with one decades ago.  It's not perfect - the plutonium core has decayed enough to force NASA to shut down some instruments for lack of power - but it still works.  The same type of generator powers the Curiosity rover, and many other spacecraft.</p>
<p>As for radio, that's a little more straightforward:  we have really big receivers and powerful transmitters on Earth, as well as really smart error correction.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Here's a picture of a similar plutonium core - it actually glows red-hot:

<p>So, Voyager will continue running until its RTG stops making enough power, we give up on it, or it gets hit by a rock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I used to leave that up as a screensaver at work, in full screen mode. </p>
<p>In fact, as I type this, antenna 63 in Madrid is communicating with Voyager 1 (probably the contact details of some alien life form, well, one can hope)! </p>
<p>Edit: I just realized I could also post the link that shows the tracking schedules of the Voyagers... it's maintained quite well: <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/" target="_blank">http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: Seems like another commenter also shared the same resources :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its using radios waves powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (Expected to power the satellite till 2025). It have 12 ft parabolic antenna. The signal is received by Deep Space Network located in California,Spain and  Canberra, Australia. The other countries with DSN are <del>Europe</del>, Russia, China, India, and Japan. It take a while for the radio waves to get here (<del>I'm guessing more than a Day</del>.<strong>EDIT</strong> As per u/TankerD18 its takes about  19 hours, 7 minutes, and 28 seconds. So its takes less than a day). The flight control always keep the antenna oriented towards the earth. You can see real time status <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/" target="_blank">HERE</a> and Weekly reports <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/" target="_blank">HERE</a> .   </p>
<p>Edit: DSN operated by European Space Agency (known as the European Space Tracking (ESTRACK)) is scattered across Australia, Belgium, French Guayana, Three in Spain, Sweden, Portugal, Argentina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
