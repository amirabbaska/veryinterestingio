		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves don't really heat food itself, they mostly heat the water <em>inside</em> food. But microwaves don't heat the water evenly. It gets heated in little sections, and those hot parts spread heat to all the cold ones. That takes time though. When food snaps but doesn't get hot its because the water in those hot parts started boiling (that's the sound) but it hasn't been long enough for the heat to spread out (that's why its cold). This is why packages say to let the food sit for a few minutes after cooking. Or you can run the microwave a few seconds on and a few seconds off to spread the cooking time out, which is the same exact thing the &quot;power&quot; setting will do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the food has thin areas, they will heat faster and sizzle/pop before the thicker part is heated. You can either bunch the food together and use lower power level/longer time, or spread the food into an even thin layer and use high power. Stir halfway through and after heating to even out the temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well according to <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ca/support/skp/faq/1057966" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>Popping or cracking noises can be caused by the following:</p>
<p>• The food item you're cooking in the microwave. Dense foods or foods high in fat content can cause more noise. Covering foods and piercing the skin of potatoes and other vegetables will help reduce this.</p>
<p>• Food spills can also cause popping noises. Clean up spills in the microwave as soon as they occur.</p>
<p>• Operating the microwave empty can also cause popping and can damage the interior. Always have something in the microwave when you run it.</p>
<p>• Using metal or metal-trimmed cooking utensils causes arcing in a microwave along with popping or crackling sounds.</p>
<p>• If you are using the metal cooking rack, having the rack installed improperly can cause popping or crackling. Make sure the rack is firmly in place and not upside down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves do not heat food evenly <a href="https://youtu.be/7FhwTelc5Tg?t=211" target="_blank">due to the presence of standing waves in the microwave</a>.  Certain sections of the microwave will get hotter than others, since the standing waves are, well, standing (i.e. they aren't moving).  These hot areas can start boiling before the rest of your food is hot - especially if your food cannot dissipate the heat from these hot areas fast enough.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why microwave food will oftentimes tell you to leave your food in the microwave for 1 minute after cooking is &quot;done&quot; - to allow the heat from the hot areas of the food to dissipate and even out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of people in here explaining how microwaves work but in this case I think we maybe need to talk how microwaves fail.</p>
<p>If the microwave is sparking and not heating you could have a blown out magnetron antenna.</p>
<p>Sometimes the magnetron can fail in such a way that all of its energy runs straight to the chassis of the microwave like a lightning bolt. It makes a weird electric sound and the food heats very little or not at all.</p>
<p>You likely need a repairman. Source: am repairman.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
