		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pro pyrotechnician here: pick up a copy of G.W. Weingart’s book on fireworks. It’s got everything you need to know in it. </p>
<p>Briefly, to answer your question, the pattern you see in the sky is simply a larger version of the arrangement of the composition (“stars”) within the shells. </p>
<p>Color-changing is simply one composition ball, dipped into another composition. Like a Whopper malted milk ball. </p>
<p>(Just sitting here browsing reddit, after wrapping up our show tonight in Blaine, WA.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Fixed George Weingart’s name. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From there you calculate the amounts required for any of the effects you want and put it in a housing. Anything more specific and you're going to want to get a book. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We  have a large display in Edinburgh at the end of the festival - quite a few years ago the company who did the display invited me to see the prep and setup - this was still on a mechanical system for triggering the display, and he said that a lot of the set pieces had a single activation fuse triggered by the controller, and that the subsequent timing of these sequences was done by the use of slow fuses triggered by the main fuse, and they could time the delays with enough precision this way, and it made the wiring up, the most time consuming part, far easier - it was fascinating.</p>
<p>He said that his company made many of the larger shells, but a lot of the smaller &quot;filler&quot; fireworks were bought in from China.</p>
<p>Apparently you can easily spot a firework factory - they have thick walls and paper thin ceilings so that any accidents go up - not out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It seems to be like baking.  If you follow the recipe you should get the effect as advertised.  Once you master the basics you can start making your own successful recipes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is the Discovery channel's documentary in the Zambelli Family Fireworks business. Pretty much every awesome show that truly stunned you was using their products.
