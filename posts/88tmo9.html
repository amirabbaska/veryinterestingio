		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two factors, I assume, are at play here. </p>
<p>One, non-violent crimes are sentenced less harshly than violent crimes. Two, more often than not, those involved in high dollar white collar crimes typically have a high income job, aside from the ill-gotten funds, with which to mount a much better defense than, say, a back alley purse snatcher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A man steals $5000 from a hedge fund by creating a paper trail that points to an error in accounting. He’s caught in a audit and he goes to court. It’s a shit show of paperwork and confusing details and the lawyers doubt that any jury could understand or even care so to avoid a stupid trial over five grand the guy pleads to simple theft, no penalty other than its on his record and everyone walks away.
A man pulls a knife on a 16 yr old cashier and steals $50 bucks but is yelling and waving the knife and making threats. He’s caught and charged with theft and four other more serious counts. The cashier is traumatized and the store wants to set an example. A jury can totally understand this and there’s a real want for justice. The guy ends up doing three years for the crime. </p>
<p>$5000 theft and the guy walks free.
$50 theft and three years in prison. </p>
<p>It could easily be $500000 to $5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a myth that white collar crime is punished less harshly. You can spend a long time in prison for white collar crime. The thing is, most white collar crime isn't as damaging, so the sentences don't tend to be as long.</p>
<p>The thing is that stuff like robbery, rape, murder, assault, and burglary can badly traumatize their victims, leaving large amounts of lasting damage. The greatest damage in a $50 robbery in a gas station isn't the money stolen, it is the trauma to the victims and the community. It makes people feel unsafe, and they <em>are</em> directly unsafe, because a violent asshole has threatened someone with death or serious injury for a trivial amount of money.</p>
<p>Violent crimes show a reckless disregard for the life and psychological sanctity of others. That creates damage far beyond the mere dollar amount stolen. It disrupts people's lives very badly and can cause psychological trauma, and things like robbery threaten serious bodily injury or death, which are <em>extremely</em> serious (millions of dollars of losses to society in many cases).</p>
<p>Most white collar crimes don't cause nearly the same level of damage to people. Those which do tend to be much more heavily punished.</p>
<p>Bernie Madoff got 150 years. Sholam Weiss got 845 years in prison. Norman Schmidt got 330 years.</p>
<p>It isn't like white collar crime can't put you in prison for the rest of your life. But generally speaking, it has to be fairly egregious, and involve multiple charges, rather than just some single event.</p>
<p>I think there's an interesting argument to be made that we should increase penalties for multi-million dollar offenses - if someone defrauds someone else for $1 million or more, I think it is reasonable to argue that that merits more than a 5 year jail term. But most fraud law doesn't actually have scaling sentences for increasingly large amounts, in part because most fraud cases don't actually involve huge amounts of money. It might make sense to have a scale for them like we do with drugs, where if you have more drugs, you get a longer sentence.</p>
<p>The problem is that most of these offenses are too esoteric for people to really get a visceral grasp on them, and most of the really bad offenders commit multiple crimes rather than just one, so there isn't a big push for it.</p>
<p>We're also seeing an increase in 20-30 year sentences for people engaged in such activities, which may be indicative of judges cracking down on the behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, it can be tough to prove exactly who committed a white collar crime when you're dealing with a corporation and at least a few c-level executives. What did the CEO know? What did he do exactly? Is there proof? Was the CFO doing it behind the CEO's back? Was he in cahoots with the internal auditors? Which ones exactly? Did these people understand what they were doing? Were they just incompetent? What work was performed by the external auditors? Did they not report something? Did they miss something? Why did they miss it?</p>
<p>And perhaps the biggest question: <em>exactly what crime was committed?</em> If you're thinking about the financial crisis of the late 00s, you have to remember that it essentially boiled down to risky, but legal, investments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
