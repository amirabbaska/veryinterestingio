		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father was a police office and he is &quot;fluffy&quot;. He recently retired so Ill tell you what I observed as his son.
Like everyone has said you don't have to do any more tests after the academy. So here is why they are &quot;fluffy&quot;. Sorry this will contain some ranting.</p>
<p>My father told me that he got ALOT of free food from restaurants,usually fast food since they don't really get breaks. (and no not doughnuts.....ok sometimes doughnuts)  my pops ending up eating out all the time. And if you ask anyone on r/fitness they will tell you thats not good. Next, is high stress. Now I want you to imagine waking up at 3 AM ever day to go to a job for 12+ hours where almost everybody you encounter hates your fucking guts . Its extremely stressful on the body and the mind.  So heres the situation, you are hated by everyone around you, and you are eating a lot of free fast food, that is probably the best part of your day,  because it tastes good. Since it was free, it makes you feel appreciated. Your brain then associates food with pleasure. With this my father has developed a eating disorder (that we are working on) and a large amount of paranoia.</p>
<p>So thats why my father is fluffy. if you want to show officers you care don't buy them food maybe just free coffee or something like that. if you really want to give them something buy them gift card for a hardware or electronic store. If you get pulled over tell them you are sorry and thank them for their work. I know it seems ridiculous, but even that little amount  of appreciation can go a loooooong way. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading and remember to respect cops work they just want to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>Edit: changed was fluffy to is fluffy. I saw him use his belly as a table just now.</p>
<p>edit 2: I suck at english.</p>
<p>Edit3: Some back story: We live in a pretty rough city and it can nerve racing knowing that you can be targeted at any moment. This didn't make the news, but my dad was talking to some officer buddies and one of the new guys was geting out of his van and was almost hit by another guy while parked in front of a gas station. Luckily he saw at the last second and jumped pack in and didn't get hurt. Targeted for no fucking reason. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been in law enforcement for 12 years. I am not &quot;fluffy&quot; myself but I do my best to maintain a level of fitness. It was easier when I was single. Now married and with a family it is fairly difficult to fit in workout time on shift work, but I do my best.</p>
<p>Almost everything I have seen here is correct. Shift work, overtime, long hours, all make it difficult to find time to work out and eat a healthy meal. Plus sitting and irregular sleep. And yes, alcohol, but for every cop who pounds the booze to feel better there are one or two others addicted to crossfit (who may also pound the booze).</p>
<p>The test to get in is, as what has been said here, the minimum fitness requirement. Most people with a basic level of health who are fairly active can pass. Once in the academy you train and run regularly. Fitness is encouraged. Once you are out, there is no fitness requirement.</p>
<p>However, my department (and many others) have fitness incentives. We conduct a yearly fitness test and the better you do on it, the more time off you receive as a bonus. There are no penalties for showing up and walking your mile and a half or just refusing to participate.</p>
<p>A test required to keep your job would be difficult (and in many cases unfair) to scale for older officers, smaller officers, female officers, bodybuilders who can lift a car but can't run for shit, etc. And to be honest you want older, experienced officers in the field. They may know how to the job far better than the gym monster who just got out of the academy.</p>
<p>It's also why proper techniques for gaining control of a combative subject are not <em>supposed</em> to rely on strength. Doesn't mean some bruisers don't rely on that, but I'm getting off topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm about to get on a flight so I won't be able to respond to any comments for a while, but I work in law enforcement. More specifically, I work in the training and standards department for my entire state.</p>
<p>Here's what I've learned over my years: many young people enter the training academy in decent shape and (unfortunately) usually in the best shape they'll be in for the rest of their career. Physical fitness is stressed during academy training hours although nearly every department does NOT have fitness maintenance standards. </p>
<p>Law enforcement is an extremely stressful job and taxing both emotionally and physically. Officers work long shifts and odd hours. This does not foster a healthy work environment nor do officers want to do much besides put their feet up after work. There is also a very high rate of heart disease and alcoholism in the profession. In fact, heart disease is one of the top killers of law enforcement officers (not sure where it sits currently, but I think it's in the top 3). There's also a high rate of divorce in the profession. </p>
<p>So the next time you see a &quot;fluffy&quot; cop, just remember they might not have always been that way and they're doing work in an environment which inherently does not foster good emotional and physical health. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Canada recruits to the RCMP and some local police (my local one uses it) have to pass the PARE (physical ability requirement evaluation). There are 3 sections: obstacle course, push/pull station, and torso bag carry. </p>
<p>The first two stations (Obstacle Course and Push/Pull) are timed and must be completed in less than/equal to 4 minutes 45 seconds for applicants, and less than/equal to 4 minutes for members applying for specialized duties and cadets before graduating from Depot. The last section, the torso bag carry, is a pass or fail activity and is not timed.</p>
<p>I worked as a civilian employee at my local police department and from what I heard it can be a tough test. They have to do it to get into training, at the end of their training year, and again at the end of their first year on the street. Unless they apply for a specialized duty (like the tactical response unit) they may never have to do it again after that. Probably why some policemen get &quot;fluffy&quot; after awhile (although tbh I never saw a fluffy policeman when I worked at the department).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
