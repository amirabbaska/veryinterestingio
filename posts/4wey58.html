		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am gonna use the movie interstellar to explain my question. Specifically the water planet scene. If you dont know this movie, they want to land on a planet, which orbits around a black hole. Due to the gravity of the black hole, the time on this planet is severly dialated and supposedly every 1 hour on this planet means 7 years &quot;earth time&quot;. So they land on the planet, but leave one crew member behind and when they come back he aged 23 years. So far so good, all this should be theoretically possible to my knowledge (if not correct me).</p>
<p>Now to my question: If they guy left on the spaceship had a telescope or something and then observes the people on the planet, what would he see? Would he see them move in ultra slow motion? If not, he couldnt see them move normally, because he can observe them for 23 years, while they only &quot;do actions&quot; that take 3 hours. But seeing them moving in slow motion would also make no sense to me, because the light he sees would then have to move slower then the speed of light?</p>
<p>Is there any conclusive answer to this?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By time dilation, we <em>mean</em> that the light emitted by those on the water planet over 3 hours in their rest frame is received over 23 years by the spaceship in its rest frame. So the observer on the spaceshift sees them move in very slow motion. The images are also extremely redshifted and very difficult even to detect.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>For a given observer, the speed of light is <em>not</em> constant throughout all of space. A light signal right next to you will always have speed <em>c</em>. But distant light signals have different speeds. To an observer exterior to a black hole, light slows down as it approaches the event horizon. This is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime since we cannot generally have globally inertial coordinates, but rather only <em>locally</em> inertial coordinates.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> There are a lot of follow-up questions about the non-constancy of <em>c</em> and how that statement fits into relativity. It is true that in <em>special</em> relativity, the speed of light is both invariant (all observers agree on the speed) and constant (the value is the same everywhere). That is known as the second postulate of special relativity. That's only true because we have the luxury of <em>globally inertial</em> coordinates in special relativity, i.e., there is no spacetime curvature. Once you have curvature, general relativity takes over and <em>the second postulate is simply no longer true</em>. We have to modify the postulate considerably.</p>
<p>The presence of curvature means that we can only have <em>locally inertial</em> coordinates, which roughly means the following. At any point in spacetime, you can always adapt your coordinates so that spacetime &quot;looks flat&quot; <em>but only at that point</em>. (For the math inclined, this means you can choose coordinates so that at the point <em>P</em>, the metric has the form of the Minkowski metric with vanishing first derivatives.) Away from that single point, spacetime does not look flat. To capture this mathematical fact, we usually say things like &quot;special relativity holds in local experiments&quot; or &quot;you cannot perform a local experiment to distinguish between gravity and uniform acceleration&quot;.</p>
<p>So how does the second postulate change then? Well, it's still true <em>locally</em>. That is, if a light signal passes right next to you, you will <em>always</em> measure it to have speed <em>c</em>, no matter how fast you are going and no matter where you are, as long as you are right next to it. So the speed of light is still <em>invariant</em> but only <em>locally</em>. But someone else very far away will <em>not</em> measure the speed of that light signal to be <em>c</em>. In fact, suppose a light signal is traveling through space and we have a whole chain of observers, one after the other, camped out along the path of the light signal. For funsies, we don't even have to assume they are all at rest with respect to each other. As the light signal passes by each of them, they each measure its speed. Then some time later everyone reunites to compare their measurements. Guess what? They <em>all</em> come back and say that the light signal had speed <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>However, suppose we picked out one specific observer and asked him to continuously measure the speed of the light signal. The moment the signal passed him, he would record a speed of <em>c</em>. But for all other points on the signal's path, he would record a value not necessarily equal to <em>c</em>. The speed could be less than <em>c</em>, the speed could exceed <em>c</em>, it may even be equal to <em>c</em>. But it's certainly not guaranteed to be <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>Now for all of the questions about the speed of light being a universal speed limit. <em>That</em> is still true as long as you modify &quot;speed of light&quot; with the word &quot;local&quot;. Go back to the previous example with the one observer measuring the speed of light along its path. Suppose that at some point he measures the light signal to have speed <em>c</em>/2. That's fine. But that also means that <em>nothing else</em> he measures at that point can have a speed that exceeds <em>c</em>/2. In other words, the local speed of light is <em>still</em> the universal speed limit.</p>
<p>However, you should be careful that not everyone agrees on the local speed of light. That guy might say that light has speed <em>c</em>/2 at that point, but someone else might say it has speed <em>c</em>/4 or something. If the first guy measures some particle to be moving at <em>c</em>/3 at that point, that does <em>not</em> contradict the fact the second guy sees an upper speed limit of <em>c</em>/4 at that point. Remember, they are using <em>different</em> coordinates. Since both observers are not <em>right next to</em> the light signal when they measure its speed, all they are doing is measuring a coordinate speed, which are generally not very physically meaningful. You <em>cannot</em> unambiguously define the velocity of distant objects in general relativity.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more details, you can see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4sfhbq/if_light_is_sucked_into_a_black_hole_due_to_its/" target="_blank">this thread</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4sfhbq/if_light_is_sucked_into_a_black_hole_due_to_its/d59so7w" target="_blank">my follow-up post within that thread</a>. If you are math- or physics-inclined, you can also check out an introductory GR textbook. I recommend Schutz for starting out, followed by Hobson. <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/" target="_blank">Sean Carroll's text</a> is freely available online, but is more appropriate for a graduate course in GR. Wald's text is classic but is for advanced graduate students.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The spaceship, in orbit around the planet, should be affected as the astronauts who land on the surface are - the time dilation is caused by the gravity of the black hole, and the distance between the astronauts on the surface and the space ships is, on the grand scale, miniscule, and thus they should experience time dilation at roughly the same rates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the light wouldn't have to move slower than the speed of light.  slower light means you see something later, not slower. what he would see is a photon sent out at time T and one sent out an hour later to arrive a year in between for instance. and that would be the case for all the photons. their arrivals would be spread out over a longer time interval. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
