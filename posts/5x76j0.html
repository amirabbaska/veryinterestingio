		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scabs are very similar in feeling to a foreign body stuck to your skin. Cleaning foreign things off our skin is often a good thing, such as if you have a tick stuck to you, or a dried piece of cake batter on your face. Self-cleaning and grooming is important to stay healthy and sanitary. Thus if you can't immediately feel the difference between a scab and something foreign, your grooming instincts will kick in. If the scab is too large or fresh it may hurt to try to remove, so whether you continue to do so depends on the balance of your own innate desire to self groom, and the pain of removing the scab. Often scabs can be safely removed long before they fall off naturally, as the skin underneath has mostly healed. Just like pulling a piece of tape off your skin may be slightly painful, it certainly won't do you harm in the long run. Thus the grooming instinct very often wins out.</p>
<p>Also, an additional tidbit that might motivate the grooming instinct for scab-picking is cosmetic reasons. Looking healthy/good/not-covered-in-scabs is important for a lot of people. Picking off a dark scab can often look better than the slight redness underneath (depending on personal complexion and how healed the wound is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been doing this for most of my life. A lot of the time it is involuntary and I don't even notice it until I am bleeding. From what I have heard, it is a combination of nervous/anxious habits and possible endorphins being released. I notice it more when I am under a lot of stress at school. Additionally, it can be due to a more serious psychological issue similar to OCD in that the picking is a compulsion. I know this is not exactly a scholarly article but it describes this part of the explanation. </p>
