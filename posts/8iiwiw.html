		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. Slower digesting foods, complex carbohydrates such as sweet potatoes and grains, will stay in your system breaking down longer than quicker digesting carbohydrates (sugars). The foods all break down as soon as they're in your stomach and interact with enzymes so it's not based on first in first out exactly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what u/easyson said, it's important to realize that a &quot;meal&quot; or even &quot;food&quot; really ceases to exist shortly after exiting the stomach.  At that point you just have chyme, which is food + bile salts + water, and your small intestine starts the major nutrient absorptive process.  So slower-digesting &quot;food&quot; wouldn't get passed over by quicker-digesting food, because theres no distinction left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with the comments that say yes.  I think that is an over-simplification.  </p>
<p>The amount of time between eating and defecation is, for adults, around 35-40 hours.  However, when doing the study, the researchers observed that the molecular tracer they used had a residence time of around 53 hours on average.  This makes means that some things pass significantly more slowly than others.</p>
<p>You can somewhat test your transit time by taking a fiber supplement (if you don’t already) and waiting to see when the firmer stool exits.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin is that, of course, some things move faster.  Beet juice (or dye made from beet juice) will exit before the bulk of the beet does or the food that contained the dye does.  Again, you can be tested this at home. It’s also a good fact to know just so you don’t think you are passing red blood with your stool, because that’s what it looks like, and would indicate a low GI bleed (not high up enough t9 digest and become a more tar-like, darker material) or a tear in the anus itself.  Neither of those is fun.</p>
<p>And although it doesn’t pertain to defecation, asparagus odor in urine manifests in a matter of hours. This means that, as with beet coloring, some parts of the asparagus are extracted before others.  Again... very simple (and tasty) home experiment to verify this.</p>
<p>Those figures I mention in the second paragraph come from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/digestive-system/expert-answers/faq-20058340" target="_blank">here, a Mayo Clinic ‘ask an expert’ page</a>.  I’ve never dug up the original study... I may do that and read it exclusive on the toilet, just for some super-meta bathroom reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The identity of ingested foodstuffs is erased by digestive processes. First, food is broken into partcles by teeth and tongue. In the stomach, the ingested food is actively mixed with acid, fluid, and enzymes. Protein and fat digestion begins here. Bits of the mixture (chyme) is squirted bit by bit into duodenum where more enzymes are introduced. By the time the chyme reaches the large intestine, most nutrients have been absorbed. The large intestine recovers water and salts. The feces, except for indigestible particles, are homogeneous. So, No.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stomach is a mixer.  It doesn't really let stuff overtake but things you are at different times can exit together.  Acid in the stomach is important for disinfecting food and for breaking down some components like protein. This time things remain in the stomach depends partly on what they are made of.  The stomach can sense, via chemical sensors, when it's contents are &quot;treated&quot; and move it along.  The stomach can also let fluid sneak out and hold more solid stuff which might allow a bit of overtaking.  </p>
<p>The intestines are a long pipe.  There is no mechanism like a side track to allow for overtaking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
