Is there enough water content in the air to pull liquid water out in places where people don't have enough water to drink? Also, how would the quality and pureness rate? If the machine was kept clean would the water be drinkable?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes, but areas that don't get much rain will also have proportionally dry air. So, you wouldn't get much water from the air. In addition, this would require refrigerating a heat exchanger which would require a steady supply of electricity which is also usually a problem in areas of the world with hardly any access to fresh water. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>”According to the Environmental Protection Agency, stagnant condensate can harbor biological contaminants, including mold, mildew and algae, especially if the collection bucket isn't cleaned regularly. Moreover, the condensate can contain lead and other metal residues from the component parts of the dehumidifier. Unlike distilled water (see Nitty Gritty), dehumidifier water is never sterilized through boiling. In case you were still entertaining the thought, let me make it clear: do not drink the condensate! It is better to be thirsty than to be sick”</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quality depends on the machine itself, the materials it's made of, etc. Strictly speaking, the condensation effect affects water directly. There's not &quot;need&quot; for it to collect other unwanted stuff from the air. In fact, you could filter the air to remove dust before using the dehumidifier, and end up with very pure water.</p>
<p>The problem is that, where water is scarce, humidity is also low. This would require a ton of energy and yield little water in those cases. It won't work in a desert.</p>
<p>Collecting dew, which is a natural version of what the dehumidifier does artificially, is mentioned as a survival technique if you're stranded on an island for example. Islands are a great example of where there may be humidity, but not drinkable water. I'm not sure how effective it is, but likely better than nothing.</p>
<p>It just wouldn't be cost effective on a large scale, to provide water for a whole village for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a different take on this there are some places, I want to say in South America? That place nets on the sides of mountains which collect water from the clouds passing over the mountain. This allows them to collect water without the energy requirements of an active humidifier. However as you might guess if there aren’t any clouds there isn’t any water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
