		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all is the <em>circadian rhythm</em>. Essentially it's its a cycle that tells us we need to sleep. This cycle can last anywhere from 16-50 hours but is normally around 24 hours due to us forcing ourselves to follow a 24 hour clock.</p>
<p>So the two big factors in sleep are the <em>frequency</em> and <em>amplitude</em> of the brain. Both play a role in the different stages of sleep.</p>
<p>When we're awake, we experience a high frequency and low amplitude (Beta activity) in the brain, and as we get more tired, brainwaves become lower in frequency and higher in amplitude. when we're drowsy, we have medium levels of each (called Alpha activity).</p>
<p>Basically there are 5 parts to sleep.  2 stages of transition, 2 deep sleep (<em>slow wave</em>) and <em>REM</em> (dreaming; not the band).</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 is pretty much transitioning into sleep. Frequency is pretty low, and amplitude is higher (called Theta activity). Think of this as when you're watching TV and slowly dozing off, you remember some parts of what happened, but not all. </p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>This is where we actually feel asleep. The brain activity is almost the same here as in stage one, but the Theta activity is interrupted. 2-5 times in a minute, there are bursts of high frequency waves (sleep spindles), and another interrupter that sends one large wave up and down (k complexes). These interruptions aren't noticeable and we cant even see anything, even if our eyes are open.</p>
<p><strong>Slow wave sleep begins</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 3</strong></p>
<p>Again, the brains frequency drops and amplitude increases (Delta waves). this part of sleep is the deep sleep. thats about it.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4</strong></p>
<p>This is mainly low frequency high amplitude. We normally reach this stage after just under an hour and stay there for about 30 min. Our brains metabolism slows down to about 75%.</p>
<p>In slow wave sleep (3 + 4), our body tends to move, this is why you might wake up in a completely different position. At this point we transfer from non-REM to REM and this goes back and forth about 5 times a night (assuming you sleep through the night without waking up) each cycle lasting about 90min. </p>
<p><strong>REM</strong></p>
<p>This is where all the fun stuff happens. REM stands for &quot;rapid eye movement&quot; and is exactly what it sounds like. To begin REM, a part of our brain stem; the pons, has neurons that release chemicals which activate circuits in the brain. During REM, our eyes start to move super fast and unlike all the other stages of sleep, frequency and amplitude in the brain resemble levels from when we're awake. This is where we dream, whether it be a nightmare or a happy dream. Our muscles also undergo paralysis, so we're not moving, yet this is also the stage where genital activity happens; yes, you can thank REM sleep for your morning wood.</p>
<p><strong>FUN FACT:</strong> Using LSD tricks the brain into thinking it's in REM, this is why it causes hallucinations.</p>
<p>There are also psychological reasons for the dreams we have and what they all mean. If you have any more questions regarding brain shit I'll try to answer them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a 24 hour day, we spend a period asleep and a period awake and this is our circadian rhythm. We start to fall asleep because we have nerves in our eyes that sense decreased light levels and send input to the suprachiasmic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which then stimulates the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus stimulates the pineal gland, which secretes melatonin. The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus decreases the activity of the reticular formation, which basically &quot;disconnects&quot; the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. This decreases our level of consciousness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To supplement what O_wa_a_a_a said, the circadian rhythm is essentially what controls the sleep/wake cycle. Light exposure and hormones (cortisol and melatonin) are what regulate the circadian rhythm. Cortisol levels spike to wake you up. Melatonin gets you to go to bed (indirect relationship). This is where the &quot;transitioning stage&quot; begins. Light exposure is what affects these hormones. This is why you should take the light off when you go to bed. Your eyes detect light levels and relay the message to your brain. This goes hand-in-hand with the stages of sleep that were mentioned before.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
