		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex-developer and now IT project manager here. It depends on the size and complexity of the application.</p>
<p>For little wee ones like an Excel macro that processes a sheet or a data-cleansing routine, you usually have an idea in mind of what you need to have happen, so you break it down into steps and work through developing each step. So your mental map of the data cleanser might be: Pick up a record, look at it for these features, correct these features if you find them, put back that record in a new area. Then you build those (sometimes in order, sometimes not), test and tweak it as you go along until it's done.</p>
<p>For slightly larger and more complex apps, such as a simple game, first someone thinks about where they want to go with it, then they write the basics down to describe it to whoever is paying for it to justify getting money (if not themselves). With that concept of the game there, they start breaking it down into what they need to do first - for example, a sidescrolling game needs the ability for the character to stand on something, or a data processing application needs to connect to a data source and read a record from it - and work through that, then meshing out each additional detail as they continue. Sometimes this approach needs a concept demo too, such as if you're going after kickstarter funding. The developer invests some of their time into building a tiny part of the game that will look and feel a little like the end product, then shows it to the people they want money from so that audience can see what they're going to get. Then the now-funded developer gets approval and funding to do all the remaining detail work.</p>
<p>Big projects need teams need a much larger approach. You start with the basics in a story - &quot;it will be a first person science fiction single-player shooter with a machine possession mechanic and will support multiplayer&quot;, and then each of your sub-teams on it gets their piece to do once you've decided on fundamentals like what gaming engine you're going to use if you don't build your own, what platforms you're going to target, and who the target audience is (e.g. whether it has cartoony characters or gory exploding ones). The story/script team starts building how the visual world will work and how single-person gameplay will flow by working closely with the art design team, and the technical team weighs in on what's technically possible versus what's not. This is a very back-and-forth process. The multiplayer mechanics team starts working on getting all the send/receive processing going. Then as things work along, all the team leaders meet and check with the boss to ensure they're staying on direction, trading information and changes around, and hitting deadlines, and they adjust as they go along.</p>
<p>The &quot;traditional way&quot; of doing all that organizing, called &quot;waterfall&quot;, was to write down and get a signed off list of details before you start coding. The &quot;modern way&quot; is called &quot;agile&quot; and saying &quot;This is what we're pointing at doing this month&quot;, getting approval for that, then doing it and figuring out what the next month's work will be like when the time comes. Agile is more flexible than waterfall, but it's also less locked-in, so it's useful for some types of projects more than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The design process or the development process?</p>
<p>Development environments and technology standards allow for very agile, iterative approaches these days. So depending on the scale of the project (ie number of people) design phase might be skipped completely in favour of jumping straight into a working prototype. I'm a software developer and often the design phase is as simple as a few bullet points of requirements, maybe a sketch of the layout. We aim to get something working and usable as soon as possible, so we can get a smaller feedback loop. You don't want to spend 3 months working on something, then reveal it, only to have it be all wrong or unfit for practical use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A common approach in the industry is to have a collection of &quot;user stories&quot;. These are simple requirements from the perspective of one or more user, which can later be translated into functionality and design choices for the developer.  These user stories are then turned into work items and assigned to the appropriate developer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>As a customer I want to save my bank details for use later.</p>
<p>As a customer I want to save my address for use later.</p>
<p>As a customer I want to order pizza.</p>
<p>As a driver I want gps navigation to the customer's house.</p>
<p>As a vendor I want to upload my menu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software developer for Amazon Web Services here. In the interest of keeping in ELI5 spirit:</p>
<p>People have different ways of doing this. </p>
<p>Some people like thinking really hard, and then writing down what they thought about. They get other people who also thought really hard about it to read what they wrote. Even more people who are friends with the people who will use the application read what they wrote and think really hard about what their friends want. If the application is going to be really big, this takes a really long time because everyone has to say yes. Then engineers get in a room for lots of months and build the application. On some date that everyone agreed on, the application gets released. Then everyone hopes they were right about what users wanted. This is called Waterfall development.</p>
<p>Other people don't spend as much time thinking about it, and they usually don't write down what they thought. They start building right away, knowing they're probably going to be wrong a few times. Then they go ask all their friends after maybe a couple weeks if they like what they built so far. It's a bonus if those friends will actually end up using the thing they built. They then take what their friends said and change what they built so that their friends like it more. They keep doing this until people want them to start doing a different thing more. That's called Agile.</p>
<p>Sometimes people do stuff like sit together and build at the same time (pair/mob programming), or write a little program that says what to build and then build to make the program happy (test driven development), or even guess every two weeks how much stuff they can do in the next two weeks (scrum). People can do stuff like that whether they use Waterfall, Agile, or something different.</p>
<p>No matter what though, they're all just different ways of trying to make people a little happier by writing code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The design process of building any software starts with the “methodology” which is basically a blue print. Traditionally this was the waterfall methodology called like that because once you finished one stage you went to the next one. Newer methodologies are closer to the “agile methodology” which is the same as waterfall in terms of the steps you make, but they vary in length and number.</p>
<p>The steps are generally: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>writing a requirements specification, which is giberi-goo for talking to the client and finding out what they want. What the application should do and how it should do it. Colours, run-time, size etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design stage, doing plans or drawings for instance. The designers should talk to the client and agree on a certain look</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementation, which is what most of you will know. This stage actually builds the software and including the coding essentially. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testing </p>
</li>
<li>roll-out and providing additional support. Here the software might get uploaded / installed if necessary. Maybe bug fix patches / extra content patches will be provided if that’s what the team agreed to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The steps above are generally what’s being used in different shapes and forms.</strong> Traditional waterfall methodology would do these one after the other. Agile would do little implementation -&gt; little testing...multiple times! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
