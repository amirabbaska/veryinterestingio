<p>Edit 2: or for the lazy,</p>
<p>&quot;These are called phosophenes. This happens when you touch or rub your closed eyes, or even squeeze them tightly closed, because the pressure stimulates your retina and makes your brain perceive light. Your retina has tiny cells in it that are used to collect light. When it takes in a light stimulus, the sensation crosses over to the other side of the eyeball which is why you see the light form opposite of the side of the eye that pressure was added. Phosophenes are different from hallucinations because they are caused by a physical pressure to the eyeball that creates the sensation of &quot;seeing light&quot; whereas hallucinations are generated solely in the occipital lobe.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit 3: I am not an opthalmologist, I just remembered someone asked a similar question. I know nothing of Opthalmology aside from that iritis sucks a whole hell of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's because of your rod and ganglion cells in your eyes that detect pressure and light. Fun fact: your eyes are so sensitive that you can never see complete darkness - it can pick up even the smallest amount of photons. This color is called eigengrau.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
