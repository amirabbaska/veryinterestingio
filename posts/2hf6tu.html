A weakening magnetic field may indicate an impending reversal.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given the <a href="http://deeptow.whoi.edu/gpts.html" target="_blank">frequency</a> with which reversals have occurred in the past and the fact that in general, they are <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9782/2744" target="_blank">not correlated with mass extinctions</a> suggests that in terms of ecological change, the answer is probably not a whole lot. I think the bigger question is what effect a reversal would have on our infrastructure. We know from any number of sources that <a href="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/%7Ercoe/eart206/Cox_GeomagRev_Science69.pdf" target="_blank">reversals take ~1000-10,000 years to complete and are characterized by a gradual decrease in field intensity, that likely never goes to zero</a>. I think the question is what are the vulnerabilities in our technological infrastructure, like power grids, communication satellites, etc to a decreased magnetic field strength. I know virtually nothing about the engineering tolerances for these devices, whether any thought has been put into designing them with idea of a decreased magnetic field, or if this is even a problem. Ultimately, determining the detailed magnitude (i.e. how low the field intensity may get on shorter time scales) and timescale of a past reversal is challenging, which translates into challenges in terms of knowing what we should plan for in the event of a future reversal. That aspect of the question is better posed to an engineer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what a reversal would do to us, but one thing to note which is more just interesting than it is relevant, is that even if the field does begin to reverse, it likely won't fully reverse. About 9/10 attempted reversals abort in the first thousand years or so and return to the previous field polarity.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main effects of the magnetic field is to [redirect the solar wind of charged particles that is emitted from the sun by solar flares] (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt</a>).  This ends up creating the van Allen belts which actually cause a problem for space travel.  It has been suggested that the earths atmosphere would be stripped away by the solar wind much faster without its magnetic field for protection and this is part of the reason that Mars has so little atmosphere. <a href="http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/mars_mag/" target="_blank">http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/mars_mag/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
