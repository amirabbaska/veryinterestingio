		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human mind has two systems for representing numbers: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing" target="_blank">subitizing system for numbers up to four</a>, and an approximate ratio estimation system for larger numbers. Your choice of the number &quot;five&quot; is interesting because it is right on the edge of the subitizing system's capabilities, but you are probably able to see that there are five without actually having to count them. Let's spell out the difference here to be clear.</p>
<p>For numbers less than four, you can immediately tell precisely how many there are without having to count them (this is what the subitizing system does). For numbers larger than four you can only get an approximate estimate unless you count them (this is what the approximate number system does). The approximate number system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law" target="_blank">works like Weber's law, in terms of ratios</a>. This means that you can discriminate say 90 from 100 and 900 from 1000 about equally easily because they are both a ratio of 9:10.</p>
<p>Now to counting, which is actually a cool little invented trick that expands the capacity of the subitizing system by using language to precisely enumerate more than 4 objects (keep in mind you can't get a precise count of more than 4 objects without counting them). The way this trick works is as follows. We all memorize a verbal list of numbers that we store in long term memory (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). You may remember this being a big part of learning when you were 4 or 5 years old, and you can see that it isn't all that natural because it takes kids some time and effort to memorize this list. Now, once you have this list memorized, you can use the following counting algorithm to precisely enumerate more than 4 objects. You can then count the number of objects you're looking at by giving each a label from the memorized list of numbers, and continue this process until each object has a label, and has only one label. The label that you end at is the number of objects there are. </p>
<p>So, let's say you had seven objects on a table, there are two ways you could precisely enumerate them. The first would be to create two groups of objects that are subitizable (say, identify one group of three objects, and one of four objects), process them immediately and then add them together. The other way would be to start labeling them from your list (the first gets the label &quot;one&quot;, the second &quot;two&quot;, and so on). Then you will run out of objects to label precisely at the label &quot;seven&quot; and you will know you have seven objects. If you wanted to count 90 objects though, you would be forced to run the counting algorithm because there is no way to break that up into a manageable number of subitizable sets (sets of four or less objects).</p>
<p>When I first learned this it blew my mind, but if you think about it a little bit, you realize that is precisely what you are doing when enumerating some group of objects. You should notice that you can immediately recognize up to about four objects without counting (and can increase this with the little grouping trick I mentioned above, that I often use for numbers less than ten or so). However, notice that if you have to enumerate, say 17 objects, you probably won't be able to do so without the &quot;little voice in your head&quot;, which you are using to recite your memorized list of numbers. </p>
<p>This also explains how some cultures don't have number systems that go above two or three. All cultures have words that distinguish one object from multiple objects, but some stop there, or have counting systems that are something like &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;many&quot;. These cultures simply have not invented this linguistic counting trick because the need has not arisen, and this is not uncommon among hunter-gatherers and hunter-horticulturalists: they don't need to enumerate identical objects because most objects in the natural world can be identified individually because they are all unique. While counting seems incredibly natural to us, it is only because it is so well learned that we overlook how we got there in the first place, and so the idea that some people can get by without the counting trick can seem really odd to educated people. Interestingly, number systems seem to arise when the need arises, and specifically when people need to keep track of large numbers of roughly identical objects, or keep some record of the number for the future. When does this happen? Often with the invention of agriculture, since this often leads people to be trading, tracking, and exchanging larger numbers of nearly identical objects (e.g., bushels of wheat). This is why the counting trick has been independently invented many times over across many different cultures, yet has not been invented by all of them. For some cultures the need simply never arose.</p>
<p>It is a little tricky to give sources for all of this because it is a broad summary of a ton of research, but here are some good places to start:</p>
<p>Where Mathematics Comes From by Lakoff and Nunez</p>
<p>Human Universals by Donald Brown</p>
<p>Developmental psychology work on numerical cognition by <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/index.html?spelke.html" target="_blank">Elizabeth Spelke</a>, and <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kw77/Research.html" target="_blank">Karen Wynn</a>. </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the comments and gold. I'm glad you all found this interesting. I would love to keep fielding questions here, but I should probably get back to doing real work. However, I did want to add a call out for anyone who knows more about this topic to post something on variation in subitizing ability. It seems like over half of the comments are asking about whether this can be greater than 4, and I don't know for sure or have a source off hand. My memory is that subitizing capacity does vary, but only around about 3-5, so you can't subitize much higher than that. If anyone can find a source for this please post it. Thanks.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Looks like /u/svof posted a source on individual differences in subitization below. He points out that 4 is the modal subitization ability, which is a helpful elaboration. The general points hold, but there is more nuance in subitizing abilities than my answer implied.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow, thanks everyone. I just wanted to add that there are other ways to assess the number of objects without counting them or subitizing them, for example by using a heuristic based on shape. Many comments/questions keep stating that people don't need to count higher numbers on dice or dominoes, and that is because you have memorized the shapes that the marks make, and how each shape relates to a specific number. So, there are other ways to figure out the number of objects, such as spatial heuristics, and I bet there are probably a lot of other work arounds one could come up with. The key to these work arounds would be figuring out visual stimuli that are immediately perceptible and map onto the number of objects somehow (e.g., like if every time there were 33 objects, they would be red, and only when there were 33 objects would they be red--then you could just instantly see the red and know there were 33 objects).</p>
<p>Edit 4: Man did this blow up. Thanks for all the gold, and for the interest. I just wanted to add this edit to say that I probably won't be answering any more questions. If a unique one comes in, I'll try to respond, but almost every new comment/question is about one of the things I addressed in the post or the edits above (variation in subitizing ability, counting by subitizing in multiple groups, or counting by pattern recognition). Since I addressed those here, I'm not going to go through and answer each one over and over. One other common question is why four specifically, and I think /u/99trumpets <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ayhkp/if_someone_asks_me_how_many_apples_are_on_the/cj06o71" target="_blank">gave the best answer for this below</a>. The last thing people keep asking about is subitizing savants (e.g., people that can instantly count 100 objects), and I just want to say I know nothing about that. I haven't seen a single credible source on it though, as everyone just references some vague thing they heard or Rain Man, so it's hard to tell if it is a real documented phenomenon or not. If someone does post a source on it, I'll add it in up here, otherwise I'm not really sure how to address that specific topic. Thanks again for reading, and I'm glad you all found this so interesting.</p>
<p>Edit 5: /u/SirSoliloquy <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ayhkp/if_someone_asks_me_how_many_apples_are_on_the/cj1fx1y?context=3" target="_blank">built a cool little web app to demonstrate subitization.</a> <a href="http://stringsofwords.com/?p=82" target="_blank">Check it out!</a></p>
<p>Edit 6: Radiolab did a segment on exactly this topic. You can listen to it <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/424231" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are counting apples on a table, you can look at a small number and instantly know how many are there without counting them individually.  This is achieved using your &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing" target="_blank">subidized</a>&quot; (no, not sub<strong><em>s</em></strong>idized) system of counting.  Interestingly, I read a study recently that describes how people who play video games tend to have a higher &quot;upper limit&quot; to their subidizing counting systems.  <a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/siegler09-inpress.pdf" target="_blank">Here's</a> a similar study as I can't seem to find the specific one I read.  As SurfKTizzle has mentioned, and is mentioned in this study, 4 tends to be the highest number of objects that people can identify without counting.  I cannot say for sure as I don't have the study that relates the subidizing system to video games, but for gamers, the threshold tends to be more like 5 or 6.  My point is that you can train your brain to recognize higher numbers of objects without counting.  Beyond your &quot;limit&quot;, your brain must resort to counting things individually to reach an exact amount.  That is, unless the apples are arranged in an easily recognizable pattern, like how the dots are arranged on dice.</p>
<hr />
<p>TLDR; your brain can recognize that there are 5 apples on the table instantly, without you counting them.  Not technically correct to say that you &quot;remember what five apples look like&quot;; it's more like you can see five objects and recognize that there are five objects in an instant through a subconscious counting system called the &quot;subidizing&quot; system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
