<p>Interviewer: Ah! So, your hobby is Mathematics. That's different. Tell me more about it. </p>
<p>Me: Sir, I have been fascinated by Mathematics since I was a child. This crazy interest had led me to develop a very deep understanding and appreciation for the subject. Besides I have an intuition for Mathematics. I understand even the most complicated Mathematical concepts easily and intuitively. </p>
<p>Interviewer: That‘s good. I will ask you something extremely simple. In fact, it is so </p>
<p>fantastically simple that you probably learnt in first grade. Tell me what is the meaning of </p>
<p>multiplication. </p>
<p>Me: It‘s repeated addition. For eg. 5 X 3 = 5 + 5 + 5. Add 5 three times. </p>
<p>Interviewer: Okay, then tell me how would you explain e x π ?How do you add something, (π)times? </p>
<p>I opened my mouth. And then closed it. Then opened it. Then closed it again. Then came the shock; and the embarrassment; the realization that I didn't know What multiplication means!!! </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a purely computational standpoint, this in a sense boils down to how one explains multiplication by fractions, such as 0.7 <em> 2. Clearly that is 0.7 + 0.7, but it is also 7 </em> 0.2 = 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2, where all we're really doing is playing around with powers of ten. Once you understand how to represent a fraction in terms of powers of ten, multiplication by fractions is very similar to integer multiplication. I'll show below how we can use this to retain the interpretation that multiplication is repeat addition:</p>
<p>e ~ 2.72, π ~ 3.14</p>
<p>e x π = 2.72 x 3.14</p>
<p>2*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04) +</p>
<p>7*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04)/10 +</p>
<p>2*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04)/100 = </p>
<p>3 + 3 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.04 +</p>
<p>0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + </p>
<p>0.03 + 0.03 + 0.001 + 0.001 + 0.0004 + 0.0004 = 8.54</p>
<p>Edit: I should say that this is just an explicit example which shows that multiplication as repeat addition makes sense for fractions. I'm sure there is some other explanation as well, which more directly answers your question, <em>what is multiplication?</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 Blue 1 Brown has a video that touches on this.  I'm on mobile, but I'll look for it later.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0yfvm0UoU" target="_blank">See this video</a> about e^(πi), which is an excellent explanation of this concept with great visualizations.  And you'll understand Euler's Identity better.</p>
<p>A great way to think about multiplication is to think of it as scaling.  As stretching the number line.</p>
<p>In your example, imagine a number line and put a mark at e and at pi.  Now stretch the line so that 1 is at the e mark.  Where the pi mark stretches to is the value e times pi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you want to take a class in real analysis. The really quick answer is that your definition works for rational numbers, and we extend that to irrational numbers by defining them as limits of sequences of rationals.</p>
<p>Here's a bit longer answer, but you'd likely need at least the first few chapters of a real analysis book to make sense of it. You construct the real numbers from Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. (Equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences with the same limits, to be precise.) For multiplication, you just create a new sequence by multiplying the elements (pairwise) of the two multiplicands. Proving that this is also a Cauchy sequence is easy.  </p>
<p>In general terms, think of it as writing e and π to <em>n</em> decimal places. Then your repeated addition definition works fine. Now do it for <em>n</em>+1 digits. Show that as we add more digits to the multiplicands, the product doesn't change until (say) <em>n</em>-1 digits. So we can compute the product to arbitrary precision just by starting with enough precision in the multiplicands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiplication in the abstract is far more general. Consider matrix multiplication, for example. Better to think of multiplication as one of two ring operations that distributes over addition, a(b+c) = ab+ac, etc.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
