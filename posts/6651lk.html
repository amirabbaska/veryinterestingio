		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because light is straight and bullets follow an arc (it's where the term ballistics or ballistic flight come from).  The <a href="http://bestar15scopes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bullet_drop.png" target="_blank">barrel is aimed upwards</a> so it &quot;tosses&quot; the bullet up to or through the light path of the scope at one or two distances.  The shooter chooses the distances, in advance, when setting aim, then either adjusts his scope for any other distances, or makes an adjustment to the sight picture to vary the range.   In the language of shooting, the near distance chosen is the range at which the gun is &quot;sighted&quot; &quot;zeroed&quot; or &quot;sighted in&quot; and the cross hairs mark the intended point of impact.  </p>
<p>That's why accurately estimating distances have long been a part of the skill set required to be a good shot (so the proper distance adjustment to the sights could be made).  </p>
<p>On older guns (using slow, heavy bullets that need to arc more at long distances), the <a href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/a/aa/QuigleySharps3.jpg" target="_blank">rear sight</a> was designed to rise significantly above the barrel, so the gun's angle would rise pretty considerably.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sights can be adjusted or zeroed for different ranges.</p>
<p>This movement in the sight compensates for the difference in elevation between the barrel and sight. </p>
<p>The same applies for left and right movement as not everyone shoots the same and there are other factors such as wind for long distance shooting. </p>
<p>For example if you shoot at 600m when you are zeroed at 100m you will shoot low.</p>
<p>Take a shot at 100m when zeroed at 600m you will shoot high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weapons are &quot;zeroed&quot; to a specific distance. Think of it as like a triangle. Your optic sight path and bullet path meet at the specifically zeroed distance. For a weapon like an M4 that distance is usually 25 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most sights are adjustable to offset the angle of the barrel and the bullet drop. For instance the front sight may be raised above the barrel, but so is the rear, making the sight picture straight. By raising the rear sight you have to angle the weapon up more, which help compensate for bullet drop caused by gravity. At medium and long range the sight is aiming far above the target and it is gravity pulling the bullet towards the ground that puts it on a ballistic trajectory that puts the bullet on target. </p>
<p>You can either pre-sight the weapon for a particular range, or use sights with delimiting lines pre-set for different ranges. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is called parallax, and it is accounted for by either the sight or the shooter.</p>
<p>The center line of any rifle sight will not be quite parallel to the barrel, and will be pointed slightly down from parallel so that the line of the sight intersects with the line of the path of the bullet at some range.</p>
<p>This range can be variable based on the specific sight and the desires of the shooter.</p>
<p>As line of the sight is straight, but the path of the bullet is a curved parabola, there will frequently be 2 ranges where the Point of Impact (POI) and Point of Aim (POA) are zeroed. </p>
<p>Before the first zero range, the POI is below the POA, as the bullet hasn't started falling much as is pretty close to the straight line of the barrel.</p>
<p>After the first zero range, but before the second zero range, the POI is above the POA. Somewhere in here is he maximum hight over POA.</p>
<p>After the second zero range, the POI has fallen to below the POA again, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The shooter will need to either adjust the sight so that the POA is zeroed with the POI at the range of the desired shot or offset their reticle (&quot;crosshair&quot;) so that they know where the POI is in their scope. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
