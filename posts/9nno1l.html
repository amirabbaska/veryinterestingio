		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smallest intentional (non-fizzer) nuclear explosions are a few grams TNT equivalent.</p>
<hr />
<p>The term you want is <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/hydronuclear.htm" target="_blank">Hydronuclear</a>.</p>
<p>When designing a nuclear weapon, you need to form a critical mass (obviously), and you do that by taking a subcritical mass and squeezing it in a conventional bomb.</p>
<p>You need to test the squeeze, because that's the hard bit to get right. You do that by putting a steel lump the shape of the plutonium core into the bomb pit, blow it up, and see if it compresses enough. This is called a hydrodynamic test. That's great, but it's hard to measure exactly what happened during the squeeze because the steel is elastic and partially bounces back once the pressure from the conventional explosion is removed.</p>
<p>So the more sophisticated test is hydronuclear - you use a tiny amount of plutonium, or an alloy with some plutonium, blow it up and you can then slice through the blank after testing and see how the atomic structure has changed to get a better idea of what the peak pressures were, and where they occurred. Then you can see which bits fissioned, which tells you what the upper limit of pressure was in that part of the blank. The plutonium in there will go bang, but not enough to destroy everything, and the fission byproducts will be embedded in the steel blank. It's a nuclear explosion (energy from the nucleus contributes to the blast) but <em>very</em> small</p>
<p>Hydronuclear tests are usually &lt;1kg TNT equivalent, often only a few grams TNT equivalent. They can of course be much bigger (up to a full-size nuke), but the point of them is to allow nuclear testing without violating any treaties, turning your sensors to vapor, or generally making a mess, so they are intentionally as small as possible to collect the required data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The W54 nuclear warhead was equipped to the portable M-388 Davy Crockett nuclear launcher. The warheads would fit into small casings or backpack nukes.</p>
<p>If this is the absolute smallest possible, I don't know. This was the smallest weapon however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But there is a minimum size, a critical mass of initial fuel required, even if it fizzles and nothing substantial is consumed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass</a></p>
<p>i.e. you cannot have a nuclear hand grenade.  No known way to get supercriticality in that mass or volume</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question needs some clarification. What qualifies as a nuke? Any explosion caused by criticality? You could absolutely design a bomb that would be no worse than a firecracker caused by criticality. There are many documented criticality incidents that resulted in minor explosions that wouldn't even quality as a full stick of TNT. You could design a bomb to do that. It just would be completely pointless, why not just use conventional explosive?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no real lower limit.  It's possible to make a supercritical fission assembly (nuclear explosion, if you will) that releases so little energy that it can only be detected as a blip on a nearby radiation detector.</p>
<p>This question has come up within the context of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (not in force.)  Does a  test with a nuclear yield less than a firecracker count?  Such tests are potentially very useful to double check theoretical calculations and computational models of how real nukes would behave.    IMO, the pragmatic answer is that if the yield is so low that the test is very easily concealed from treaty monitoring, it doesn't count as a nuke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
