<p>Flak is basically a cannon that launches a shell up in the air, in the path of the airplane, and the shell explodes when it gets up there, sending pellets in all directions, hopefully hitting the airplane nearby, like in that graphic.</p>
<p>EDIT:  And it's only used against airborne targets because airplanes have to be light-weight in order to be able to fly; a cloud of tiny pellets like that will shred an airplane, but won't do much against a tank or battleship or other such armored targets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Flak&quot; comes from the German word for anti-aircraft cannon and explicitly refers to anti-aircraft.  Similar munitions used against unarmored or lightly armored ground targets are usually called &quot;anti-personnel&quot;.</p>
<p>The cloud of shrapnel produced by an anti-aircraft or anti-personnel  shell covers a large area but it is completely ineffective against most armor.  On the other hand, an armor piercing munition concentrates all the explosive energy on a single point in order to punch through heavy armor.  Because of that the shell needs to hit the target directly: close doesn't count.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old flak ammo used timed fuze with a mechanical timer and it/was used for many other large caliber weapon. If you calculate the flight time of a artillery shell you can set it ti detonate a few meters above ground called a airburst It will then cover a larger area with fragments then if it detonated when it hit the ground. The hard part is to set the time correctly</p>
<p>Recoilless rifles like the Carl Gustaf have timed shell so you can set it to detonate when it have traveled a distance so you can detonate it in the air over  opponent and hit them even if they are behind a cover.</p>
<p>In late WWII you started to have radar in shells called VT or proximity fuze. You can against aircraft set it to detonate when it is beside a aircraft  or in artillery a fixed distance above ground. Proximity fuze is common today for large caliber artillery.</p>
<p>Today there are programmable ammunition where you program the shell automatically when it s fired from a cannon. So you can have a single shell that can detonate by proximity, at a set distance  or when it hit a target of a fem meter after if you for example target a house. So you can have a auto cannon infantry fighting vehicle where you can by a switch select the more of the shell. So you can detonate shells in a air burst a few meters apart over a enemy behind cover with the distance measured with a laser. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a lot of these answers aren’t wrong but not really easily understandable, so I’ll try to take a stab. </p>
<p>A FLAK shell is a fragmentation round, in essence. Like others have said, the idea is to time the fuse on the round so that it detonates at the altitude a plane is flying. This is important because the fragmentation it releases is very dangerous to a plane’s <em>CONTROL SURFACES</em> such as the tail, or Ailerons in the wings. These surfaces are used to control a plane in flight, such as pitching the nose down or up, or banking the aircraft... even a slight loss of any control surface could spell doom for planes as large as some bombers were because it could, for example, jam the elevator into a downward position which would force the plane to nose dive without the pilot’s control. A plane could make it back to base with 3/4 working engines, but not if they have no control of their aircraft. </p>
<p>It was very unlikely for planes as large as a B17 to be taken down from “flesh wounds” such as damage to the airframe (holes in the side of the plane) unless those holes took out the hydraulics for control surfaces that ran along the length of the plane to allow the pilot to control the tail for example. Another possibility is comprised airflow. If there are enough holes in the plane it’s conceivable it would be more prone to stalling or spinning since the airstream could catch it at an odd angle...</p>
<p>Smaller planes would have to worry about a little more, but bombers generally had multiple engines and strong airframes that made control surface malfunctions probably the chief fear. </p>
<p>Fragmentation rounds were used against infantry or other lightly armored targets like houses, but not the same rounds as fires from FLAK guns. There wasn’t any other use for the timed fuse, and thus HE (high explosive) rounds were used against ground targets to achieve a similar effect with a detonation on impact instead of on a timed fuse</p>
