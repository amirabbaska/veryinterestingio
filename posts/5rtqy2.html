		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No and no.</p>
<p>Many galaxies - such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud" target="_blank">Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a> have no obvious centre.</p>
<p>The LMC has many high-energy sources. Some are probably neutron stars, and some may be black holes. There is no exceptional mass in the LMC centre. Although the LMC is clearly a first-class galaxy, it's not a classic spiral.</p>
<p>Large Spiral Galaxies all have something very massive at the centre. And because they have billions of stars, it's very likely that the thing in the middle is a black hole.</p>
<p>So: Globular clusters and elliptical galaxies: Often not.</p>
<p>Large spiral galaxies: Almost always.</p>
<p>But there are many, many very weird galaxies out there.</p>
<p>Be careful of general rules. We didn't know that galaxies existed until the <del>1950</del>s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)" target="_blank">1920s</a>  - thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/themeaningofhaste" target="_blank">/u/themeaningofhaste</a> Black holes were controversial <del>20</del>30 years ago.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a great post a while ago about how the mass of all of the stars near the center of a galaxy often contribute more to the mass located near center of the galaxy than the black hole would.  It's not 100% related because it doesn't preclude a black hole being there, but it was sort of fascinating nonetheless.  </p>
<p>If somebody could find that or the article it would probably have some of the answers your looking for.  I tried but was unable to locate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If an object is extremely massive, it is one of two things: a star or a black hole. The larger a star is, the faster it burns itself out. As the universe is over 13 billion years old, all of the largest objects in the universe are black holes, not stars.</p>
<p>All massive galaxies are believed to have supermassive black holes at their core; whether or not they all do is as yet unknown. One problem is that black holes cannot be easily detected without seeing objects fall into them and get ripped apart; a supermassive black hole without matter falling into it can only be detected by its gravity, which can be difficult at extreme distances.</p>
<p>Smaller galaxies may not have supermassive black holes at their core; while some appear to, we haven't found any in others, so they may not be a universal feature of all galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
