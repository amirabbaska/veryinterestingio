		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emoji are in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" target="_blank">Unicode</a>, as are all regular characters so just can be sent and rendered the same way as &quot;normal&quot; characters, assuming support on sending and receiving ends. Formatting such as italics need some sort of extra way to signal that certain text is formated (Like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> on Reddit or HTML), but the applications have to be the ones to know this and show the text as such.</p>
<p>Unicode has the capability for formatting (as u/mbirth demonstrates below), but many systems don't support this or partially support it.</p>
<p>Email with HTML can use its advanced formating. Its possible (and has been done) in services such as iMessage and Facebook Messager, which Apple and Facebook can do whatever they want with, but has been dropped or ignored because of lack of demand for it and/or simplicity. SMS, the traditional way texts are sent on cell phones is quite set in stone, so it very unlikely it would be changed to support it.</p>
<p>EDIT: expanded and clarified</p>
<p>EDIT: after some googling I found some very basic formatting described <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_control_characters" target="_blank">here</a>, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underline#Unicode" target="_blank">Underline</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikethrough#Unicode" target="_blank">Strike through</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some more expansion</p>
<p>Last Edit: After coming back to this after several hours I can see there are people who know more about this than me and I'm surprised this went to front page. I will try to correct what information I have. </p>
<p>Very Last edit: I hate typing so much on a phone.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Emojis are &quot;text&quot;, but formatting is <strong>how</strong> text is displayed, so it's a bit more complicated and messaging platforms usually don't bother with including it or making it well known if they did include it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emojis are like a new letter in the dictionary.
All companies show the letter U a little different, and all the companies show the Happy face a little different.
Very little agreement is necessary.</p>
<p>Bold and Italics is adding decoration to your letters, for decoration all the companies involved need to agree in the same exact format and people are dumb dumbs who can never agree on anything. </p>
<p>Edit: Going beyond eli 5.
All of the suggestions for text formatting are god awful, as they should be, since no one seems to be a a seasoned engineer, and text encoding is a deceptively complex issue.
All of the different suggestions, however, do highlight the main point that getting a group to agree on anything goes towards impossibility as the number of people goes up</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
