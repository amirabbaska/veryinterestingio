		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows! We don't know how memory works really, but we have a few ideas. Memory is super complex and truly amazing.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is involved in some way with memory making, and memory recall. We don't understand the mechanisms underlying this well enough though.</p>
<p>Memory is <em>probably</em> stored across the brain but is not a single thing. Motion memory is stored in the motor cortex, visual memory is stored in the visual cortex etc </p>
<p>It is not known where semantic memory is stored, there is a semantic hub theory worth looking at on Wikipedia. Semantic memory is like the meaning of an object. For example, remembering what a chair is, and what it is for. </p>
<p>When you remember something simple, such as eating an apple, your brain is doing something so coordinated it is almost unbelievable.
Your motor cortex is procesing the motion of your hand/arm and mouth, your visual cortex is processing the colour and shape, some part of your brain is recalling that is is food and so on. They all come together to form the memory. </p>
<p>What is amazing is that you  can break down  which bits of your brain are procesing in to smaller and smaller locations. For example, the location of the fingers area on the motor cortex and the mouth chomping bit are not the same place. The sensory input of taste, your mouths location relative to the apple, the feeling of the apple in your hand and mouth are all processed differently. Colour,  size, shape are all processed in different places of the visual cortex. There is way more areas involved than these too, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Despite the vast array of brain regions needed to come together to form a memory, you experience the memory as a single and unified. That is mind-blowingly awesome! </p>
<p>As a side note, the way memories appear to be stored and processed goes some way to explaining how they change so much over time. Chances are that some of your memories are just plain wrong, you don't know which ones are a true representation of what happened, and which are not.</p>
<p>Sorry for the poor grammar and format, typing on the phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process is not completely understood, but it's thought to occur through the use of engrams or neuronal traces. Essentially these are encoded chemical changes in specific neuronal network pathways that make them more likely to fire in specific sequence, corresponding to the stimuli that triggered it. This is believed to be mediated by the hippocampus. When attempting recall, your hippocampus tries to reactivate this same pathway to reproduce part or all of the stimulus response, allowing you to remember the stimulus by basically re-experiencing it. Hence also why memories tied to strong stimuli like trauma can have such profound and real effects on people when recalled.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question that many psychologists and neuroscientists are working to answer in model organisms like sea slugs, all the way up to humans. First, the system that is recruited to remember some 'thing', depends on what the 'thing' is. If the 'thing' is something like where you ate for dinner last Friday, then it would be considered an episodic memory and we know that the hippocampus is necessary (at least at when making the new memory and for a while after; Look up Henry Molaison). If the 'thing' is how to play Chopsticks on the piano, then it's under the category of an implicit memory that is learned through repetition and doesn't need the hippocampus (look up Clive Wearing and watch him play the piano). One current theory has that these systems are relatively distinct. </p>
<p>I did my dissertation on how episodic memories of our lives (i.e. autobiographical memories) are dynamically retrieved by scanning people's brains as they retrieve memories about their life in an fMRI scanner. One key is that the process is dynamic and depends on what you're trying to retrieve and for what purposes. So, imagine a friend asks you about the first flight you went on. First, you'd have to rule out or inhibit all of the memories of 'not my first flight' to mentally time travel back to the time that you went on your first flight. This process is called Access and is most often associated with the feeling you get when you're &quot;trying to remember something&quot;. It might be the primary process effected with various forms of memory loss. This Access process activates a brain network that is likely driven by activity in the right ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex (translation: right outside part of the brain just above your temple). This part of the brain is in sync with the hippocampus and parietal cortices to narrow down your memories to 'first flight' and begin constructing the experience (Here is a paper from my Dissertation on this topic: Inman et al., 2017, Neuropsychologia; and another great paper St. Jacques et al., 2011). Once you have the memory narrowed down and in mind, you'll likely need to 'Elaborate' or 'Reconstruct' the sensory (likely primarily visual) details of the memory in your mind's eye. This process requires a slightly different network of in sync brain regions, that also includes the hippocampus, but primarily synchronizes the low and high level visual cortices in the Occipital and Parietal lobes. The elaboration process also engages the &quot;Working Memory&quot; network that involves synchronization between frontal and parietal regions on the top of the brain. It's important to note that this is &quot;What's happening&quot; at the scale of brain metabolism and blood-flow (fMRI), which is a relatively slow process and not nearly the speed of cognition. The speed of cognition is in milliseconds, so we are using other techniques like intracranial EEG (electrodes embedded in the brains of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to figure out where their seizures begin so a neurosurgeon can cure their seizures) to map how processing changes as you try to make and retrieve new memories. Because we can also stimulate through the electrodes embedded in the memory systems of the brain, we are now figuring out ways to use direct brain stimulation to help us make stronger memories in the first place or access the memories we've made before (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1714058114" target="_blank">Inman et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02753-0" target="_blank">Ezzyat et al., 2018</a>). </p>
<p>If you're trying to retrieve a word from a list of words you just saw, this is what is happening ([watch this awesome video from my friend John Burke] (<a href="http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page#Neural_oscillatory_correlates_of_episodic_memory" target="_blank">http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page#Neural_oscillatory_correlates_of_episodic_memory</a>))</p>

<p>When you encode (/ &quot;make&quot;) a memory, there is a finite number of neurons all active at the same time. These include neurons in your hippocampus, cortex, and many other brain regions, depending on the contents of the experience. For an experience to become a memory, this group of neurons (called an ensemble, or in more psychological parlance, an engram) needs to strengthen the connections between themselves so that later on, they can all re-activate together.  When you recall a memory, certain part of that ensemble is activated by whatever stimulus reminds you of the memory. The activation of that subset of neurons leads to activation of the rest of the neurons in that ensemble (because they strengthened their connections to each other), and when the full group activates together, the memory is remembered.</p>
<p>Trying to recall a memory is searching for the right mental stimulus that will trigger activation of enough of those neurons so that the whole ensemble becomes active. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
