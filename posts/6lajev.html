Even if it isn't public, if some idiot installs the facebook app on their phone and has it in their contacts, facebook will link you. Same for email address - if someone has that in their phone's contacts or gave facebook access to their emails (e.g. has both the gmail and facebook apps installed).</p>
<p>I recently saw someone from way far away with 0 friends in common who I have emailed a few times for something very specific and business-related as a suggested friend.</p>
<p>Facebook actually <a href="https://spideroak.com/articles/facebook-shadow-profiles-a-profile-of-you-that-you-never-created" target="_blank">builds profiles on non-members based on members' data</a> and then links the two if that person ever does join facebook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No phone number. No email. Nothing. We have no mutual friends. I don't have anything linked to my workplace on my profile at all. We don't even work out of the same building or the same city for that matter. I would really love to know how that works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of ways. If you have the account signed in on your phone, it can read your contacts and find their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p>An obvious way: it looks at mutual friends.</p>
<p>If you use apps via Facebook, it could look at other people using those apps, people you've used it with and people nearby who've used it.</p>
<p>It could and probably does track the location of users (via IP addresses and GPS) and - if it finds you spend a lot of time with particular accounts - might consider that you were friends.</p>
<p>It might also buy data from Google, Yahoo or Hotmail about the people certain people email, and find accounts registered to your frequently contacted email addresses.</p>
<p>Finally, it's unlikely but possible that if you create multiple accounts from the same computer, it will automatically associate them with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
