		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have enzymes in our body called metalloenzymes that contain metals to catalyze chemical reactions or maintain the enzyme's structure. These essential metals include iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, copper, cobalt and a few others. </p>
<p>Most metalloenzymes work only with their original metal in it. For instance if you replace the zinc atom in the enzyme <em>Carbonic anhydrase</em> with another metal, it can't function anymore. Some of the toxic metals you mentioned are similar in e.g. size or charge to these native metals, which means they 'fit' in the same spaces. So when lead or mercury enters a cell, it can replace the 'natural' metals inside the enzyme. (In many cases it even binds more strongly to the enzym than the original metal, making it harder to get out of there as well.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At an ELI 5 level, IIRC (science teacher but I haven't covered this stuff in a while) our tolerance for different materials  can be compared to how much of the materials exist, in an accessible form, in nature.   In other words, the more of something that's part of our environment, the more likely we are to tolerate it.</p>
<p>By way of example, we have a really high tolerance of water, a medium tolerance of iron, and almost no tolerance for iodine but we need a little bit to prevent goiter.  Water is everywhere in the environment, iron is fairly common, and iodine is rare.  Lead and Mercury, by comparison, are rare to begin with and tend to be locked up in rocks.  When they get released, usually by people, our bodies are not prepared to deal with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemistry. At any one moment there are millions of chemical reactions ongoing in order to keep your body in balance in alive. Everything from your cells reacting glucose for energy (the Citric acid cycle) to CO2/O2 gas exchange in the lungs is ultimately a chemical process.</p>
<p>Many metals are required in small amounts because they participate in those reactions either as an ingredient, a catalyst, or as a component in an enzyme.</p>
<p>Many other metals are acutely toxic because their chemistry allows them to substitute in to some of the millions of reactions nessecary to keep you alive. For example Arsenic reacts with an ingredient key to the Citric Acid Cycle in a way that prevents function and energy generation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>you have a fire station with a garage where you can fit all the fire trucks (essential metals) you would need in case a fire breaks out. now if you put omnibusses in there instead, they may fit as well but don't have the same function meaning they will block the space for the real deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s probably easier to explain in a case by case basis... but most metals that are toxic shuts down important processes... like lead inhibits red blood cell synthesis, and mercury inhibits our ability to fight oxidative damage. Iron is necessary for red blood cells to bind oxygen and zinc is an important component of many ligands which is basically when a metal attaches to another molecule and kind of activates it... that new molecule helps in things like DNA replication as well as a huge list of other things.</p>
<p>Why is it that way? God/evolution/coincidence whatever flavor you want. Why do metals interact in a certain way? Electrons get real crazy when they’re close to each other sometimes it’s good sometimes it’s bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
