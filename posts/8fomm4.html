		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cockatiels frequently suffer from what are known as &quot;night frights&quot; where they exhibit stressed and frightened behavior when disturbed by a noise in the dark. Cockatiels, like humans, are diurnal animals and most of their predators, like predators of primates, are primarily nocturnal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are asking if we know how the animals feel relative to human emotions. Such answers are always difficult, if not impossible, since the animals can't tell us what they are feeling. We can only read into their responses. </p>
<p>Also, the amount of light that humans perceive as &quot;dark&quot; is not the same amount of light that other animals perceive as darkness. </p>
<p>That being said, and if we compare to humans, we should probably be looking at group animals that are not nocturnal. </p>
<p>Try getting your dog to follow you into a dark cave. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people traditionally think of people being &quot;afraid of the dark&quot; they tend to think of metaphysical things; ghosts and zombies and witches, etc etc.  Certainly animals don't know that kind of fear.  Those fears are based on human culture and very high levels of intelligence.  I think animal fears are more practical.</p>
<p>If you took an animal that primarily relied on vision for defense and put it in an environment where it felt threatened and its vision was impaired, I imagine it would be more afraid than if it could see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do we actually fear the dark? Or is it, as Dumbledore says, fear of the unknown? Humans are unique in their capability to reason and hypothesize, while other organisms only have limited capacity to do so. If there were other organisms that were afraid of the dark, I would think it is more of a learned behavior from bad experiences rather than an innate fear of the unknown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve got some chickens and they have very poor eye sight in low light (but excellent in good light). When it starts to get to dusk they retreat into their coop or try and a roosting spot as high up and hidden as possible. I wouldn’t say they are scared of the dark but they are certainly at their most vulnerable and sometimes freak out if you approach them quietly as they can’t see you but you can see them</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
