		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question you're really asking is &quot;does the energy savings from having the LED off part of the time outweigh the energy used by the circuit doing the blinking?&quot; It's hard to answer this in the general case because there are so many variables. If we assume the clock circuitry is simple and well designed, which is probably a reasonable assumption, it's likely the blink circuitry is lower power than the LEDs so it should save power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what kind of circuitry is doing the blinking, but in general the blinking would use less energy than the solid LED. Even if you were using a microprocessor it would be drawing microamps of current.</p>
<p>It's a strange question because both of these use a very small amount of power so either way don't worry about &quot;saving&quot; power by using a different alarm clock system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matters what kind of display technology.</p>
<p>LED or old school vacuum fluorescent: It uses less while blinking. Almost all of the power in a clock like this goes into the display because the display needs to emit light. You've never seen a battery powered LED clock because the batteries would last only a few days. Well, a blinking display is only lit up part of the time, so it's using basically no power during the times it's off. Hence, less power overall. </p>
<p>LCD: More power, but basically immeasurable. It does take a bit of power to make an LCD change state, and a bit of power to calculate when to do this, so it is technically more power. But it's probably like 0.01% more.</p>
<p>EDIT: LCD's are less too because they aren't bistable. See comments below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a simple, direct answer: no. The blinking clock will generally use less power than a steady clock. The reason for this is that the (assumed 7 segment LED) display uses substantially more power than anything else in the clock.</p>
<p>Even if the clock does not use a transmissive display, the power draw isn't going to be measurably higher for the blinking device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
