		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Maybe. It depends what dark matter is.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> <em>Dark matter</em> is a bit of a catch all term. It's just meant to describe the bulk of the apparent gravitating mass in the universe which is not luminous. We don't know what it is yet. The evidence is really really good that it exists, we're just not sure what it is. </p>
<p>Generally, 'dark matter' is used to refer to a presently unidentified kind of matter. For example, some people think that maybe there were just a whooole bunch of black holes floating through space, waaay more than any model for stellar evolution might predict, and since black holes don't give off light they would constitute 'dark matter'. But this isn't a favored answer for a long list of reasons. </p>
<p>A more popular idea presently is that dark matter is some kind of particle. Aptly called 'particle dark matter.' This kind of dark matter would be a heavy and abundant particle which just doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force, so it doesn't give off light and it doesn't really clump into planets and stars the same way that atoms do. There are a lot of hypothetical candidates with all sorts of fun names, like sterile neutrinos, WIMPs, and axions. </p>
<p>If one of these hypothetical candidates really is the dark matter, which whizzes around and could be all over the place, then there is probably some passing through your room right now, streaming through the earth like a ghost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don’t know.<br />
“Dark matter“ is sort of an umbrella term for one or possibly several unidentified forms of matter that interact with the universe’s gravitational forces, but are not visible or detectable by any means presently available to us.<br />
There are many different theories out there for what dark matter is and how it works, one of the more popular ones being what’s called “particle dark matter,“ where dark matter is a kind of dense particle that doesn’t interact with the electromagnetic field, and thus doesn’t give off light or interact with other matter normally.<br />
There are a few different interpretations of this theory, as well as several different names for the particle in question.<br />
But for the time being, we don’t know definitively what it is, or isn’t, so it’s impossible to say for certain whether not there could be dark matter in your room right now.<br />
So, the short answer is, “maybe.”<br />
It’s understandably frustrating when science can’t give definitive answers to things like this, but unfortunately, something you just have to accept with certain fields is that there are some things in the universe you just have to take at face value.<br />
We can’t see dark matter, but all of our numbers indicate that it <em>should</em> exist, so we have to move forward under the assumption that it does, because otherwise, all of our other theories fall apart and would need to be rebuilt from the ground up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let's assume that dark matter is just plain old ordinary space dust, but that our estimate for the density of space dust is too low.  Maybe we think that on average there is 1 hydrogen atom per cubic meter in interstellar space, but there's actually 2 or 3.  Could this account for observations?  If that were the answer, how much of a discrepancy would we need?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
