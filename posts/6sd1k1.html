<blockquote>
<p>Dogs are capable of recognizing their names, and discerning it from other sounds. Recent animal behavior studies have found that dog's brains behave in much the same way our brains do when someone says our name. It appears that they are able to recognize that their name is not just another sound that someone is making, but is meant to specifically identify them.  Cats have been shown to do this as well. The research suggests that cats can also tell when you're using their specific name. The reason they often don't react? They don't care.</p>

<p>The parent and offspring dolphins (or parrots) use their signature calls to find each other when they are separated and to identify themselves when they approach each other. Each individual has their own unique call, and in many respects these calls serve a similar function as personal names do for humans. </p>

That dot on ITS head is on MY head!&quot; Animals that can get that far have a better chance of having enough self concept to associate a name sound with themselves, not unlike a visual image with themselves.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test</a></p>
<p>Alex the (savant?) African grey parrot had enough self concept to ask &quot;What color [am I]?&quot; while looking at a a reflection of himself in a mirror. It's so far the only known existential question from an animal (and some hardcore types aren't 100% convinced it wasn't a collection of really good conditioning and memorized responses.). </p>

<p>With dogs it basically comes down to training them to match up a word with a meaning or object. But dogs may have limited ability to contextualize our meaning when giving commands as well. </p>
<p>It gets even more interesting when looking at dogs that are bilingual, such as German Shepherds that have been trained abroad and used domestically in K-9 units. They may understand two different words to mean the same thing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
