<p>Voyager had 800x800 pixels (0.64 megapixel). Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has resolution up to 160 megapixels. </p>
<p>The transmission speed is the big difference. Voyager transmits at 160 bits/second  vs 6,000,000 bit/s for MRO.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are simply so many improvements we could use.</p>
<p><strong>Power source:</strong> Given how far the giant planets are from the Sun, we'd still need to rely on some kind of radioisotope generator - solar panels just won't cut it. The old RTGs are big and clunky, but they work. There was considerable research into making a sleek and light <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Stirling_radioisotope_generator" target="_blank">Advanced Stirling Engine</a> - more power for lower weight, and a lot less plutonium required - but sadly funding got cut for this a few months ago. This was mostly political, although a few folks were worried since it had moving parts, while the old RTGs just sat there.</p>
<p><strong>Propulsion:</strong> Obviously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster" target="_blank">ion propulsion</a> is a huge upgrade that we didn't have back then. It's slow, but once you're in any kind of stable orbit, it's super efficient. </p>
<p>Another propulsion tech right around the corner is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System" target="_blank">Space Launch System</a>. It's technically being developed for manned spaceflight, but I was told point-blank by the Planetary Mission director at NASA that with the amount of thrust it could provide for the future <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper" target="_blank">Europa Clipper</a> spacecraft, it will cut a trip to Jupiter from the current ~7 years to just 2 years; no need for flybys of random inner planets anymore, we can make a direct flight.</p>
<p><strong>Sensors:</strong> I don't even know where to begin with this one. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device" target="_blank">CCDs</a> were just being invented when Voyager was being built...as a matter of fact, Voyager used old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidicon#Vidicon" target="_blank">vidicon</a> technology for its cameras, the same thing that old TV broadcasts used. Now CCDs are everywhere, even in your cheapo phone camera. That said, I don't know of a single current spacecraft mission that doesn't use them.</p>
<p>Similar advances led to our infrared technology becoming incredibly more sensitive and higher resolution since the Voyager. Additionally, our spectroscopy has become much more sensitive with laser etched gratings and the like.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there are now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_field_unit" target="_blank">Integral Field Units</a>, which allow you to do hyperspectral imaging. It used to be that when you make an astronomical observation, you have a choice: either take a 2-D image at one specific wavelength, or take a spectrum that has 1-D of image resolution and 1-D of spectral resolution. Thanks to IFU's (and a few other similar clever techs), we can now take a 3-D image cube that simultaneously takes 2-D images in a wide array of different wavelengths.</p>
<p>Finally, probes. Voyager never dropped anything into any planet or onto any moon. That changed with the Galileo and then Cassini spacecraft, but even since then the materials technology has improved to the point where we could make stronger, lighter probes that have much longer-lived batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Now, here's what we don't have since the Voyager days:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Funding:</strong>  Voyager was lucky enough to be riding on the coat tails of the Apollo missions, being developed when <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/NASA-budget-federal.jpg" target="_blank">NASA funding</a> was still riding out its big money spike.</p>
<p>As it stands now, we're subject to the whim of whomever is currently in office, trying to imitate a JFK-like vision of space exploration, but never providing the cash to do so. Are we building a space station? Are we going back to the Moon? Are we going to Mars? Wait, now we're going to capture an asteroid?</p>
<p>The problem is that any of these projects are going to require a much longer time to develop than one or two presidential administrations. Moreover, it's going to take money. Planetary exploration has been consistently cut year-to-year, either to revamp our manned spaceflight capabilities, or worse, provide subsidies for private corporations so they can figure out how to build a rocket.</p>
<p>As it is right now, there are no plans for a future <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_program" target="_blank">Flagship-class</a> mission of similar scope as the Voyager spacecraft. The budget's just not there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big issues with space flight nowadays is radiation blasting your electronics. The old way (i.e. space shuttle era) was triplicating every critical piece of tech and running them all in parallel.  As you can imagine, this can significantly increase the weight required.  </p>
<p>Since then, we've been able to make microprocessors that are radiation-hardened, but they have the performance of processors 10 years ago. So, a RAD750, released in 2001, is about as powerful as a Pentium Pro. And it costs $200k.</p>
<p>In response to this, research is looking into using commercial parts in interesting ways to bring down that cost while providing superior performance. My research is using partial reconfiguration on FPGAs to detect and correct faults in real-time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Yes it is 'only' going to Pluto but that's just a matter of planetary positions. It's going to fly past Pluto in 2015 which means a 9 year journey.<br />
Compared to the 12 years voyager took to get to Neptune it certainly seems like there has been some improvements made over the years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
