<p>Usually a male will defend a batch of flowers, if the female (every female bee is a queen in the sense that they can reproduce) comes to that batch, she risk being impregnated by that male. The good thing is, if she stays near that batch, that male will not attack her (but will not help her otherwise).</p>
<p>If another male comes that batch, the original male might try to attack him. Then he dies because his life-span isn't that big. A female can lay a maximum of 2 seasons (years) with luck, the good species and good timing. Males live a few days to a few weeks, so you can see fights during a few weeks at most.</p>
<p>Exceptions exist like the European solitary Hoplitis anthocopoides who try to nest near other bees, but don't have a social structure. So the territoriality might fluctuate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I only know about Honey Bees, but I imagine other bees are similar. </p>
<p>Bees work in a hive mind. They are a macro-organism and individual honey bees don't really make decisions. Two honey bees would not fight over a single flower. The primary conflict between Honey Bees is robbing. This can happen for a multitude of reasons, but this is one entire hive of bees trying to steal honey from another. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally <em>apis mellifera</em> honey bees do not fight over flowers. There just isn't enough nectar in a single source to justify the effort nor enough bees present at a single source.</p>
<p>As beekeepers we do see them fight over strong sugar sources, like if we put out a bucket of sugar water or a frame of honey and when robbing happens. Robbing is when a strong hive tries to steal the honey of a weak one. Fighting will occur at the entrance of the weak hive. Honey bees have been observed to rob bumble bee hives.</p>
<p>This sort of fighting behavior can also bee seen when other species like Japanese giant hornets or yellow jackets attack a bee hive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
