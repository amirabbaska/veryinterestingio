		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood would not rot in space. It would also not be a good thing to build out of it, for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>First off, wood couldn't really rot in space because there would be no oxygen, which some decomposing bacteria probably use. More importantly, there would be no water. Any water in the wood would flash boil, and the wood would be left bone dry and husk like, if it was even still in one piece. With no water or air, even bacteria that might have been able to live off of just the wood will quickly lose a lot of their ability to metabolize.</p>
<p>Wood would be a horrible building material, though. For one, it's not airtight. It would be impossible to build pressurized structures, as the air would escape through the wood.</p>
<p>If you aren't interested in building pressurized structures (for instance, a cargo container or some support), you still wouldn't use wood. Wood is heavy for the amount of support it provides. It would be much more cost efficient to use an aluminum structure, since weight is at a premium for space launch activities.</p>
<p>Even if you didn't care about that, the wood would probably not respond well to the temperature fluctuations. I don't think anyone's ever tested wood for it's mechanical properties at -200 F, or +200 F, but I doubt it would last very long switching back and forth between the two.</p>
<p><strong>Obligatory Reddit Gold Thank You Edit:</strong> Thank you, anonymous giver, for breaking my Reddit Gold cherry. </p>
<p>Because I am now rich both in spirit and material possessions, I will give away <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sy9lVl4.jpg" target="_blank">this gift</a> to you all. You're welcome, America. All other countries may grudgingly come along as well.</p>
<p>As a general update, many people have pointed out that this has some mild factual errors (fungi are the major rot elements, not bacteria), and places where this analysis could have been opened slightly to alternative interpretations. As always, the first answer is neither the most correct nor most complete. </p>
<p>Regardless, it was a fun thought experiment. Thanks to OP for posting, and for other commenters who have added much enlightening discussion, clarification, and further questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood rot is caused predominantly by wood decay fungi. These organisms, like us, use oxygen for respiration and could not survive in space. </p>
<p>However, wood is susceptible to photo degradation. The tops of downed logs in a clear cut are not well suited for decay organisms due to a lack of moisture, but you will notice how these surfaces are bleached and weathered nonetheless. This is because of UV exposure. The copious amounts of unfiltered uv radiation in space or on the moon   would soon turn wood to space dust even in the absence of decay organisms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hate to burst peoples bubbles who just make stuff up. Wood has been used in spacecraft that where designed to go to the moon. Ranger 3-5 all had balsawood as a major component of the (crash)landing system</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ranger 3 was the first of the so-called Block II Ranger designs. The basic vehicle was 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered
with a balsawood impact-limiter</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is judged by it's utility versus its weight because weight costs fuel to boost into orbit.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out,  it's not an ideal building material for space, but the wood wouldn't &quot;rot&quot; in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>However, it would be expected to decay on the moon. The &quot;hard&quot; ultraviolet radiation from the sun has sufficient energy (per photon) to break the chemical bonds in the organic molecules that make up the wood. On earth, this hard UV is strongly by the atmosphere, so the effects are much weaker (causing only minor discoloration), but on the moon one would expect it to very slowly cause the wood to decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
