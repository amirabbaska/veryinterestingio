		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with statistics like this is that you can't conclude that people making $75 000 income can afford $900k houses. </p>
<p>First of all it's the AVERAGE home cost, which means one rich street where 50 houses go &gt;$10M has the same impact as 1000 houses costing $500k. The median would be a better statistic here. </p>
<p>Secondly, and probably more important is where the average income of 75k comes from. If it's the average income in Canada, you can't really compare it at all. If it's the average income in Toronto, you still have to wonder: is it the income of the people WORKING in Toronto, or LIVING in Toronto? A lot of the people working in Toronto live out of the city itself, where housing is cheaper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several comments are talking about the difference between mean and median, and how that can distort the data. While true in general, that isn't what's going on in this case.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://trebhome.com/market_news/home_price_index/pdf/TREB_MLS_HPI_Public_Tables_0317.pdf" target="_blank">benchmark prices</a> for Toronto real estate released by the Toronto Real Estate Board. The <a href="http://trebhome.com/market_news/home_price_index/pdf/Benchmark_Home_Definitions.pdf" target="_blank">definition</a> of the benchmark homes is </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benchmark homes are representative of standardized homes for specific sub areas. Their physical
characteristics remain fixed over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These numbers are <em>not</em> averages that get distorted by a few multi-million dollar houses. For March 2017, the benchmark home price for a detached home in the City of Toronto is $1,171,900. For a semi-detached home, it is $877,900. If you look at the neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood breakdowns, the range of prices is about $700,000 to $2,500,000 for detached houses and $600,000 to $1,350,000 for semi-detached.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>median</em> household income in Toronto is <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil107a-eng.htm" target="_blank">$75,000</a>.</p>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that, in Canada, to get a mortgage on a house that costs $1 million or more you must put down at least 20% of the sales price, plus various taxes. In Toronto those taxes mean that, to buy a million dollar home you need $250,000 cash up front. </p>
<p>So, to the question: how do people afford these houses? Without some outside factor, people can't.</p>
<p>What sort of outside factors? The simplest one is people who bought a house when it was more affordable sell it, and use the proceeds to buy their next house. Some people who have higher incomes, and higher income relatives, will borrow/receive a gift of money for a down payment, and then can (barely) afford the interest because of historically low interest rates. Some people borrow money for a down payment, which is not legal, but is done anyways. And a large number of properties are being bought by wealthy speculators buying multiple properties in the hopes that they will continue to rise in value; one recent study suggests <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/investors-super-heating-the-toronto-market/article34380897/" target="_blank">25-30%</a> of homes bought are by speculators, and their methodology looks like it could be a large under-estimate (they track houses that are sold and then put up for rent using the real estate board, but only some rental houses are done through real estate agents, many are rented privately via Craigslist or similar services).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to give you a truly Toronto perspective. I’m a millennial, home owner in Toronto. With some family help my wife and I had to buy recently in this rapidly inflating market. Anecdotally I don’t believe it’s foreign buyers - more on that shortly.</p>
<p>Toronto is the financial hub of Canada, a country with a generally stable, safe economy that is still quite undervalued on a global scale. Canada was one of the few countries barely affected by the 2008 financial crisis due to our strict banking laws and strong financial sector.</p>
<p>Toronto arguably has the highest paid jobs in the country many of which are in the downtown core. There’s a high number of commuters that work in the city but live outside in neighbouring towns. The city has the highest level of immigration in the country. We have a greenbelt surrounding the city that is protected from construction preventing the expansion of the city, instead our growth comes from densification. As a result, there is huge demand for single family homes in Toronto. There aren’t any single family homes being built, instead homes are torn down to build condos and townhouses. The city is getting denser every day. As density increases, commuting becomes more difficult exasperating the demand to live closer to the core in Toronto. As demand is on the rise, supply of homes are declining (no new single family homes and shortages of people selling), further increasing demand.</p>
<p>If I own a home and am planning to sell - a home in Toronto sells in a few days regardless of condition, so most people will buy first and then sell. Imagine going to look for a home and you find that you’re competing with new home buyers, buyers looking to switch houses, people from the suburbs looking to buy - there is a ton of competition. After a few lost bids, most likely you’ll just stick in your current house - again further reducing inventory. It’s not uncommon to have 30 bids on a single family home in Toronto. As a result bidding wars are common and are being fuelled by low interest rates from the big banks. </p>
<p>Unless interest rates go up, government intervention, or there’s a sudden recession in Canada, we’re unlikely to see a change in the current situation. Although there’s huge demand for homes in Canada in major cities such as Toronto or Vancouver - the rest of the country is stagnant on growth, so the government has little option but to keep interest rates low to stimulate growth. </p>
<p>Because single families can’t afford these prices they are accepting buying homes outside the city. If there was a sudden price correction in Toronto, they would drop their homes outside the city and try to buy in the city (again the commuting is awful, and likely their job is in Toronto). Keeping prices relatively stable. </p>
<p>Anecdotally at least in my area - the homes I’m seeing bought have families moving into them, unlike Vancouver we don’t have entire streets that are vacant. Talks with real estate agents seem to support this, it’s families wanting to buy in the city.</p>
<p>In Toronto, the sudden increase in price has scared the public into believing that a bubble has formed. I don’t see a bubble at all. Our prices are still lower than Vancouver or other major cities in countries which are the financial hub. If we compare our prices to say Sydney, or Stockholm, or Vienna, our housing prices are still far more affordable. I just don’t think we in Canada were unprepared for this sudden rise in prices and want to point fingers at easy answers and solutions rather than seeing a complex situation based on a number of factors.  </p>
<p>In response to how do people afford them, I can’t speak to how everyone else affords them but my wife and I are average income. We saved for almost 8 years to build up a downpayment of 100K, family put in 50K to give a downpayment of 150K on a 750K property in Toronto’s East End. The house was in terrible shape and we plan to fix it up over time.</p>
<p>TLDR - Demand! How are people affording them? Saving with some added family support.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major though hard to quantify reason is that it is very easy for upper-middle and wealthier foreigners (particularly Chinese and Indian in Toronto's case) to purchase property (particularly condos) as investment properties. This skews the market tremendously.</p>
<p>Huge swathes of those new condominium buildings are sitting vacant. Try walking on the side streets and back alleys around them and there are practically billboard-sized pieces of plywood covered in those realtor lockboxes (the ones with the keys inside for agents to show the properties) for vacant properties looking to find a renter.</p>
<p>There's woefully inadequate government tracking of who is buying what, where they're from, and what it's really being used for, but talking to some realtors and doing some basic lockbox-to-units math paints a pretty clear and consistent picture.</p>
<p>Eventually that bubble is going to crash. Don't buy now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
