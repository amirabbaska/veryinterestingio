		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;why&quot;.  The mainstream big-picture answer is that animals die by old age at around the point that they'd probably end up dying anyway.  </p>
<p>Small animals that are heavily predated on (say, mice) have really short lifespans, because if they spent energy on hardening their systems so they could live longer it would be wasted; there is no point in a mouse that could live 20 years, because it would be eaten in a year or so anyway.  </p>
<p>Birds tend to live longer than mammals, because it's harder to prey on birds.  Large seabirds, that live solitary lives away from dangerous things, live for a long time.  Bats are as small as mice, but they can fly; they live much longer than mice do.  </p>
<p>There are other argument out there, but that's the general consensus.  Again, this is the evolutionary-theory &quot;why&quot;, not the mechanistic &quot;why&quot;; the concept is that it takes more energy to live longer, but it doesn't say where that energy goes, specifically.</p>
<p>A starting point for further reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The classical evolutionary theory of ageing, first proposed by the famous evolutionary biologist George C. Williams over 50 years ago, gives an answer. The theory predicts that high mortality rates in adult animals due to predation, exposure to parasites and other randomly occurring events will be associated with shorter maximum life-spans. This is because under high external mortality most individuals will already be dead (eaten or succumbed to disease) before natural selection can act on rare mutations that cause healthier ageing. The theory has since been further developed and tested in a number of experimental and comparative studies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The classical evolutionary theory of ageing (ETA) predicts that exposure of adult individuals to high rates of mortality due to predation, parasites or other stochastic events will hinder the evolution of increased lifespans, because most individuals will already have died from these extrinsic causes before natural selection can act on reducing intrinsic causes of mortality that lead to longer lifespans (e.g. favoring mutations that lead to healthier ageing) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember studying something like this a while ago. If you look up some terms such as &quot;life history trade-off&quot; &quot;iteroparous&quot;, &quot;semelparous&quot; and &quot;K-strategist&quot; and &quot;r-strategist&quot;, you'll get a feel for the answer you're looking for.</p>
<p>Basically, different organisms have evolved different strategies based on what worked best for their ancestors in their environments. Allocating resources to one factor of life such as reproduction comes at a cost to other aspects such as survival and longevity. Semelparous organisms, at one end of the spectrum, will reproduce only once in their lifetime and so there is no evolutionary benefit to them having long lifespans. Iteroparous organisms will reproduce several times throughout their lifetime and so can live longer lives. There is a balance to the amount of resources devoted to somatic effort and the amount devoted to reproductive effort. If I recall correctly, a &quot;K-strategist&quot; has a life history adapted to maximising its competitiveness and adult survival, and are usually found in environments which suit this life style. &quot;r-strategists&quot;, on the other hand, are adapted to maximising their reproductive rate and usually are found in unstable environments where rapid development and early reproduction, and therefore shorter lifespans, are favoured by natural selection.</p>
<p>So the differing lifespans of the different animals you mentioned will be due to the optimal life history strategy in the evolution of their respective phylogenetic lineages.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fascinating scaling law (Edit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law" target="_blank"><strong>Kleiber's Law</strong></a>) which states that all mammals live to roughly a billion heartbeats, and this is as true for a mouse, dog, person or whale.  I.e. you can predict the average lifespan from the average heart rate.</p>
<p>That's not a <em>why</em>, it's just an empirical fact.  Some source material and leads to further references: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate-of-living_theory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate-of-living_theory</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reproductive fitness.</p>
<p>If an animal living longer increases its reproductive fitness, then it's lifespan will likely increase. If, however, living longer does nothing to increase its reproductive fitness, it won't be selected for - and if longevity decreases reproductive fitness, it will actually be selected <em>against</em>.</p>
<p>Longevity can increase reproductive fitness in two major ways - it can either allow for a longer reproductive lifespan, so that the creature can live longer and reproduce for longer, or it can make it so that the creature's longer survival contributes to higher survival rates for its offspring or its offspring's offspring.</p>
<p>For instance, if you think about humans, an old human, past prime reproductive age, can still take care of their grandchildren, or even children they had later on in their lifespan.</p>
<p>However, some things which might increase your longevity might decrease your reproductive fitness - say, having smaller litters of offspring might make it likely you'll live longer, but it also decreases your reproductive output.</p>
<p>As such, longevity is not necessarily all upside from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>There are some other factors as well - creatures which take longer to reach maturity tend to live longer. This also leads to a tendency for larger creatures to live longer because it takes longer to achieve a greater size, though this is not a hard and fast rule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
