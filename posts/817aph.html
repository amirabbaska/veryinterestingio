Then how come Uranium and other elements exist? I'm assuming everything came into being from Hydrogen which came into being after the Big bang.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone! I'm gonna go through the links in a bit. Thank you for the amazing answers!! :D</p>
<p>You guys are awesome!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of processes that create elements heavier than iron. The s-process (s for 'slow') happens in large stars, where atomic nuclei capture free neutrons, increasing their mass. Occasionally they'll undergo beta decay, increasing their atomic number. This takes a long time, but because there's just so much stuff inside stars, it works out, and is responsible for about half of the atomic nuclei heavier than iron.</p>
<p>The other half are typically created by the r-process (r for 'rapid'). This occurs when there are a lot (and I mean a lot) of free neutrons around and nuclei just soak them up. Conditions like these tend to only happen in core-collapse supernovae, and so many of these elements are created during supernovae.</p>
<p>EDIT: Others have pointed out that we now also have evidence that suggests many heavier elements are created within neutron star collisions. I figured I should add this here since it has become a popular answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Created in super and hyper novas and detonated out across cosmos. The remaining star dust then gets back together to form new stars and planets.</p>
<p>Before the solar system, there was another star that detonated and from some of that material, the Sun, Earth and a bunch of other planets were formed. So we are like brother/sister with all the other planets and the sun. Earth wasn't formed &quot;by the sun&quot;, we were both formed by the remains of some older, previous star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I study this! Supernovae are still candidates for producing some of the heavy elements, but many modern theoretical studies show that they <em>can't</em> produce things like uranium.</p>
<p>As a few people pointed out already, neutron star mergers are a big candidate for producing the heaviest elements that cannot be produced in supernovae.</p>
<p>But there are other exotic astrophysical phenomena are still possible, like supernovae with ridiculously strong magnetic fields. </p>
<p>The actual process of making uranium requires a lot of neutrons. You can't really slap two iron nuclei together and get tellurium. But an iron nucleus can capture neutrons and just form a heavier isotope of iron. So if you start with 56Fe, you'll have 57Fe. Repeat, and now you have iron with a bunch of neutrons. At some point, nuclei don't like having so many neutrons, so a neutron will convert itself into a proton in a process called beta decay. So if you have, for example, 75Fe, it's not very stable, and will beta-decay to form 75Co, which is the next element on the periodic table. So if you have a bunch of neutrons constantly bombarding your iron nuclei, you can eventually build up to heavier and heavier elements.</p>
<p>This process takes place on the order of seconds or less. It's <em>very</em> rapid.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask more! I love talking about this stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And this article about galactic fountains in which supernova drive elements into the galactic disc for them to cool and fall back in to seed new stars.  <a href="https://www.space.com/11729-hubble-telescope-photo-galaxy-fountain.html" target="_blank">https://www.space.com/11729-hubble-telescope-photo-galaxy-fountain.html</a>
I have read somewhere that to account for all earth elements and isotopes, 11 supernova would have to have seeded our stellar nursery.   Then there is an article that wolf-rayet star bubbles can form solar systems.  <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/solar-systems-wolf-rayet-stars-bubbles-formation-761408" target="_blank">http://www.newsweek.com/solar-systems-wolf-rayet-stars-bubbles-formation-761408</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The iron triggers the death of the star by supernovae, and then the supernovae itself fuses the heavier elements and distributes them outward from the expansion. These form asteroids, comets, or just general dust that then gets caught up in neighboring stellar neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Remember, the first stars were hundreds of times the mass of the sun. A single novae from them generates enough elements and dust to create <strong>hundreds of solar systems</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
