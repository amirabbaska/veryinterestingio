		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR: To almost every actor in the region, they are more useful alive than dead</strong></p>
<p>To understand the answer, we must first understand some significant points:</p>
<p>1) Any answer that says &quot;x is the main problem&quot; is super simplistic. It may have part of a problem, but, like the rest of the grown up problems of the world, a complex issue like ISIS/terrorism cannot be reduced to a single point.</p>
<p>2) There are always more questions than clear answers. This is a significant problem when lives are at stake, but I do believe that, given the research over the last century or so, we have a fairly reasonable idea.</p>
<p>The single sentence answer, which necessarily needs to be broken down into a thousand different pieces, is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>The vast majority of terrorism in the last two centuries has been committed due to the political interaction of identity and the state</strong></p>
<p>To understand this completely, we have to understand the concept of the nation. Most people around the world feel nationality in at least three levels:</p>
<p>1) Lowest level - The state as a function of nation
2) Mid level - the Ethnic group as a nation
3) Highest level - Religious group as a nation</p>
<p>There are other &quot;nations&quot; as well, but these three are the most common. Now, the marriage of Westphalian peace that designated  (theoretically) standard borders and the increased centralization and power of governments, the challenge became to somehow synthesize these three. The idea of a political &quot;people&quot; is born. The most cohesive state, then, was one where people shared all three national identities. The least cohesive state was one that had neither 2nd or 3rd, and thus even the function of the state as a nation fall into peril. </p>
<p>Following the peace at Westphalia, Europe was consumed by violence which was primarily nationalistic violence. Between revolutions, revolts, genocides, and ethnic cleansing, Europe was a blood bath from 1648 to 1945. When one portion of Europe reached stability, another portion was lit ablaze by nationalist politics.</p>
<p>The Arab world never had that moment. Even after the fall of colonial powers in the Arab world, the cold war politics of the US and Russia necessitated that the Middle East, a key region in the cold war, could not suffer the instability like that of Europe after Westphalia. So strong men were put in place who clamped down on the political negotiations which are required for the long term stability of a state which functions as a nation (A nation state).</p>
<p>Now, fast forward to today. The strong men of the Arab world collapse (Saddam and Yemen forcefully, Mubarak, Qadhafi, and Assad by public pressure). This unleashes a huge tide of suppressed nationalist politics, which is always, always, always both disastrously bloody and excessively violent. Add in the Western exploitation of Pan-Islamism for combating the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, which leads to 9/11 (once the Soviets were defeated in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda and other mujahideen groups focused on two other Empires encroaching on &quot;Muslim sovereignty,&quot; the US (Iraq, Palestine, the Gulf) and Russia (Chechnya)).</p>
<p>Now, how does this lead to terrorism against the West? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The West obviously has a terrible reputation in the Middle East, going back two centuries. But <strong>America's</strong> bad reputation starts in the 50s, with the opposition of the United States to Mossadeq, the United States propping up of Israel, the US opposition to Nasser (who was extremely popular in the Arab world), and the United States support of dictators. Now, add the Iraq sanctions and the Iraq War II, and you get just flaming hatred for the West.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That hatred is used by the Pan-Islamists in fighting the US wherever it has presence in the Muslim world. But, for nationalists like ISIS, it has a much more sinister use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacking &quot;the West&quot; creates legitimacy for ISIS. Due to the involvement of the US during the cold war (and after) in the Middle East, hatred for the West is immense in the Arab world. Attacks against the &quot;oppressors,&quot; then, serves as a legitimizing tool in a fight where manpower is at a premium. </p>
</li>
<li>This leads us to ISIS of today. It is a nationalist movement which gains legitimacy for showing how it is fighting the historic oppressors by bringing the war to them. &quot;We are doing to them what they have been doing to us&quot; is the line they use consistently in their recruitment material. The goal, though, is to swell their ranks LOCALLY, not to actually harm the west in any way. No one seriously thinks ISIS is creating any real national security risk for Western nation -- not ISIS, and not Western nations. This is just a really great propaganda tool for them. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, given all the above, why is ISIS so difficult to defeat:</p>
<p>The reason why ISIS in particular has not been defeated, is, primarily power politics:</p>
<p><strong>1) Power politics between nations always supersedes the threat of terrorist organizations</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) ISIS is not the main concern of Middle Eastern nations. The power imbalance and vacuum between Iran, the Gulf allies, and Turkey is</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) The Syrian civil war adds to those complications significantly</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Nations are more focused on fighting for power balance than against ISIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) In managing the power politics in the Middle East, ISIS is actually useful for most if not all powers in the area</strong></p>
<p>Let's give a couple examples:</p>
<p>1) Turkey: </p>
<p>Turkey was fighting Assad in Syria, but the Kurds to the north were a serious threat to their territorial integrity. As such, they helped ISIS fight the kurds to the north as well. But to assuage Western powers, they made a show of fighting ISIS as well.</p>
<p>2) Saudi:</p>
<p>Saudi is actively funding ISIS to push back Iranian allied Syria and Iraq and force Iran into a perpetual war with ISIS. This is because the Gulf allies are terrified of being surrounded by the Iranian led alliance of Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. It therefore needs to ally with groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda to force Iran into perpetual war and keep it from cementing that alliance.</p>
<p>3) Iran:</p>
<p>Iran wants to fight ISIS. It really does. It's probably the most active in fighting ISIS. But it can't make a death blow to ISIS yet, because of Iraq and Russia.</p>
<p>4) Russia:</p>
<p>ISIS is extremely useful to Russia. As long as ISIS remains a force, it provides Russia diplomatic cover for its activities in support of Assad as long as it can shove a few bombs towards ISIS and say that it's there for terrorism. Therefore, Russia NEEDS ISIS to assist its ally Assad.</p>
<p>5) Iraq:</p>
<p>Iraq is a key ally to Iran, and ISIS is an existential threat to the Shia regime there. BUT airpower is extremely limited in efficacy, Iraq doesn't have a strong enough ground force to take ISIS on itself, the US won't allow the only other real enemy of ISIS (Iran) into Iraq en masse to defeat ISIS, and the other members of the anti-ISIS coalition see ISIS as to useful to destroy just yet</p>
<p>6) The US and the Western Allies:</p>
<p>This is where things get really fun. The West wants to defeat ISIS. But to do so would effectively hand Syria to Russia\ and Iraq to Iran, making a giant power block from Iran to Syria and Yemen to the south. So it wants to use Iraqi ground forces to force ISIS into Syria  and let them fight it out in the Syrian civil war, while putting diplo pressure on Iraq to break its ties with Iran and try to isolate Iran diplomatically. </p>
<p>The key to defeating ISIS:</p>
<p>1) End the Syrian civil war
2) Bring about political reproachment in Iraq and Yemen
3) The powers in the area will crush ISIS in a day</p>
<p>Edit: All the above is an interpretation consistent with the theories of the school of realism in international relations. For more information about the realist school, read &quot;The Man, the State, and War&quot; by Kenneth Waltz, &quot;Theory of International Politics,&quot; by Waltz again. For my favorite sub school, offensive realism, read &quot;Tragedy of Great Power Politics&quot; by John Mearsheimer. </p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radical ideology is really what we are fighting here and every time collateral damage occurs it undermines our ability to fight radical ideas further. It actually helps spread the ideas. It's like carpet bombing a forest fire. </p>
<p>For some context, I was in Iraq in 2009. As you would imagine, most the destruction had already taken place by then. So I got to see the aftermath of our invasion. There was no open resistance when I was there. No one tried to fight us. They just watched us roll down the roads for the most part. </p>
<p>Now imagine if you were say, 5 years old, and your home was destroyed by a bomb. Maybe someone from your family was killed. But it left you without anything to call your own. No one to call in case of an emergency. No one to call if your sibling falls ill. Not even a nation to call home. Not even shelter, except for what you can literally build from the rubble. </p>
<p>Now imagine, little you sponging up all the info you can, all this has taken place around you, without you having any idea why. You see these foreigners who don't speak like you or look like you, you don't understand them, and you're told &quot;that's who did this to us&quot;.  Those <em>people</em>.   No matter how bad someone tells you it was before, you can never feel like it could be any worse than it is now. </p>
<p><strong>The enemy we are fighting now, is an enemy we created</strong>. </p>
<p>It's no longer an abstract idea. The kids that grew up amongst the rubble that we prepared for them are now fighting age. Radical ideology spreads through the oppressed like a plague and those people will forever fight. It's not that I sympathize with them. I just understand the anger. Isis is just one of the many names that this ideology has fallen under(Boko Haram, Mujahadeen, Janjaweed, Al Qaeda) and it's not the only kind of radical ideology. </p>
<p>The difference is the amount of time, space, and motivation that's been necessary to breed. All of this is compounded by hostiles never being a uniformed enemy. They always wear civilian clothing. </p>
<p>Here are some <del>pics</del> really incredible photos taken by a soldier in my platoon. These were taken during one of many humanitarian missions we ran while we were there. This shanty town was built in the protective area right outside our FOBs gates. This should help you understand what I mean. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to ISIS being a guerrilla army, there are a few other reasons...</p>
<p>They are not only fighting to gain territory, but in order to control it they also need to act like a government for the people living there under their rule.  When organizations like this succeed in providing electricity, food and water for their people, they gain some legitimacy and sympathy from people in the region.  (Surely they're not doing a great job, given the circumstances, but I'm sure their followers are giving them some leeway.)  This is how the Taliban is still in power in parts of Afghanistan, because they do make efforts to keep the people fed, employed and somewhat protected.  </p>
<p>ISIS has been well funded, and this is a major reason why they're still surviving.  They have hijacked oil fields and sell that oil on the black market.  They are also secretly funded through unknown supporters, likely to be Saudis who share their religious ideals and support the growth of Salafism/Wahhabism in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The long term strategy of the Obama admin, from my understanding, was that they would eventually run out of funds, and once they did that they would begin to see fractures in the morale of their fighters, and a general diminishing of local support as they fail to keep their promises to the people in their &quot;caliphate&quot;.</p>
<p>So airstrikes have been targeting their shipments of oil and illicit funds, cutting off their supplies which has led to a <a href="http://deadstate.org/u-s-airstrikes-drive-isis-recruitment-down-to-just-200-new-fighters-a-month/" target="_blank">reduction in their recruitment efforts and an increase in defections.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to getting the local population on your side. If you agitate them, don't work well with them etc. They turn on you and just see you as an outside threat. They recruit people easily becasue there are so many people who have been directly affected by a bombing. Put yourself in their position, you live in the middle of a desert, you believe in an afterlife and an all powerful creator. Then some guy comes along and kills your niece with a rocket. You are now incredibly mad. Then this other guy in your village says it's from the terrible west, (which it generally is), and says that if you help him you can get back at the people who did this. He says there are people in the community who are working with the people who killed your niece. And we need to find them and kill them before more people die. Then a big rebel force rolls into your village, parading around with flags, makeshift military armored trucks, etc. They are saying they are going to go fight back against the people who are bombing them. Now after all this your family has fallen apart, maybe you are watching day in day out as your city gets bombed, maybe it's just the radical interpretations of holy books that eventually gets to you. Either way you are hopped up on religious koolaid, you are incredibly pissed off, and someone just gave you the means to get back at the people who have more or less destroyed your life. And all you have to do is join us. That is how people get radicalized, war after war after war for decades. I'm going to say this as non politically as possible. The US is very heavily indirectly funding ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The US provides a massive amount of funding and weapons to Saudi Arabia.

There are also many other reasons as to why it's hard to stop a group like ISIS. It's easy to retake the land, the US by itself could probably defeat ISIS in under 4 days if it committed to it. It's very very hard to do so without creating a power vacuum and making things worse in the process. Source: the current state of the middle east and the war in Iraq. Historically there have been two ways to deal with a problem like this. One you go in and kill literally everyone, civilians, military and take the rest as slaves, and destroy every memory and building made by the people you are against. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carthage_\(c._149_BC\)" target="_blank">See the annihilation of Carthage, third Punic war.</a> The second is a far far better solution. You withdraw your military, set up a border make sure they can't invade you. Then wait for a while. From this point three things might happen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions" target="_blank">One the people themselves with rise up and put an end to the current rule.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" target="_blank">Two the economy will collapse and a new government will form.</a> or three <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/22/obama-strengthens-iran-deal-over-gop-outcry/94286304/" target="_blank">the established government or your own government will try and make economic ties with the country to try and persuade them to change themselves through trade deals, or other kinds of deals</a>. Keep in mind the second of the two options might well fail and you are back to the beginning. However it's the best option for reducing loss of life. That is just looking at how things have played out in history, it very well might be that none of those things happen and something else that no one has yet thought of will happen. Only time will tell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this case, the use, threat, and utility of force are not effective deterrents or solutions to psuedo-organizations like ISIS.  These types of organizations are bound by a similar ideological belief, which makes waging traditional war against them incredibly difficult, if not impossible.  </p>
<p>While a lot of responses here are partially right, I have to say that the situations in the Middle East and North Africa are a lot more complicated than starving them of money, supporters, leaders, or having a strong military presence on the ground.  If things were that simple, we would have solved the issues in the Bush years, or during Obama's troop surge and increased drone strikes.</p>
<p>But, why is ISIS so hard to defeat?  Because ISIS can be boiled down to a combination of fringe religious ideology, long-standing cultural identity that goes back hundreds to thousands of years that Western powers tend to choose not to fully understand, and the economic + governmental damage Western powers initially caused dating back to the raping and pillaging of the area back during the the era of global European colonialism (that this region still hasn't recovered from).</p>
<p>Quick Edit:  I see a lot of people throwing Vietnam in as a parallel.  Truth is, there are very little parallels to Vietnam and ISIS outside of guerrilla warfare.  The manner in which we waged war in Vietnam was wholly ineffective for a variety of different reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
