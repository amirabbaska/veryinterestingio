		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's poorly understood, but we think it involves the concentration of certain chemicals, including adenosine, in the cerebrospinal fluid.<br />
When you are awake, it builds up and makes you feel tired.<br />
While you sleep, it gets removed, leading to you feeling well rested when you wake up.  </p>
<p>Note that this is separate from the circadian cycle (body clock), which also affects how awake or asleep you feel based on a 24-ish hour cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on other people's answers, while we don't know all the functions physiological sleep serves, there is good amount of evidence supporting the <em>two-process model of sleep</em> consisting of two parts.</p>
<p><strong>Process S</strong> is a sleep-dependent. It is caused by multiple factors, such as build-up of different compounds in the neurons. These include, for example, activity-related genes and molecules of adenosine. The feeling of restfulness comes from the clearing of these compounds during sleep. The role of adenosine can be easily seen in your daily life using coffee, which blocks the reseptors sensing the build up of adenosine, thus tricking your body to think there isn't as much sleep need built up. I also mentioned gene build up, which includes immediate early genes such as Homer1a, c-Fos, etc. These serve variety of functions, including the downscaling of synapses during sleep, driving plastic changes, conserving energy, and building up more resources for the next wake period. They are expressed in neurons in response to functional activity: for example high amount of planning and mental work builds up these genes in prefrontal cortex, leading the person to feel tired faster and the brain region to undergo synaptic reorganization during subsequent sleep period. The accumulation of Homer1a can be seen electrophysiologically using electroencephalogram (EEG). High accumulation of sleep need results in increased slow wave activity in the non-REM sleep early on during night. As the molecular correlates of sleep need are cleared from cells during the sleep, subsequent sleep cycles produce less and less slow wave activity. If the sleep is of insufficient depth or duration, some sleep need remains and you will wake up feeling unrested. </p>
<p><strong>Process C</strong> is a sleep-independent process. This side of sleep doesn't care about the activity the organism encounters during day or how much it has slept, it's essentially a clock. Certain genes in brain regions related to sleep-wake regulation flip in a timed manner during the day. They can be slightly modulated by environmental factors and affect the &quot;mental energy&quot; levels of a person, but they are mostly involved in subconscious functions, like time-dependent release of hormones during the day. The clock genes are unfortunately not fully adapted to 24hour day cycles, and if all natural light cycle is removed, the period of wakefulness starts to shift later and later.</p>
<p>There are also other factors regulating sleep, but the process S should answer to your question. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! I apologize in advance, I'm on mobile, so it's not as in-depth as it perhaps should be.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows why humans sleep, or why it renews them - or any other animal, for that matter. Humans will start to hallucinate and eventually die if they don't sleep for a very long period of time, but we don't know why that happens either.</p>
<p>So yes, humans spend a third of their lifespan unconscious and hallucinating things that they'll likely forget before waking, and no one really understands why.</p>
<p>But we do know it is important.</p>
<p>We know that some things happen in the body when you sleep, but we don't quite understand the significance of sleep vs wakefulness. We know that sleep has some restorative effects, but we don't know what makes sleep special, as many of them are also accomplished while awake, but seem to progress more slowly.</p>
<p>The core question you asked does not have a very good answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mainly to do with hormones. During the day certain hormones build up which make you feel more stressed/tired. Then when you sleep these hormone levels drop again. But there's also a lot to be said for just switching your body off and letting everything rest for a few hours!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So after a buildup of adenosine, like some have said, we feel tired. If we drink coffee at this point, does this cause a breakdown of adenosine NT, the reuptake of it by the neurons, or how exactly does this work?</p>
<p>Because inhibiting an already built up concentration would still cause us to have a large amount of it...stating that after weâ€™re tired, we would essentially drown out the effect of caffeine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
