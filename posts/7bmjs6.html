The study indicates that when looking at code and trying to figure out what to do, the programmers brains actually used similar sections to natural language, but more studies are needed to definitively determine if this is the case, in particular with more complex code. It seems like the sections used for math/ logic code were not actually used. Of course, that might change if one is actually writing a program vs reading the code, but...</p>

<p>Speaking as a programmer, I believe the acts of writing and reading code are fundamentally different, and would likely activate different parts of the brain. But I'm not sure. Would be interesting to compare a programmer programming vs an author writing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My part 2 of this question would be how does the cognitive load of programming relate to cognitive load present in natural languages? Does experiencing (possibly) increased cognitive load from programming affect how the brain handles natural language?</p>
<p>At the very least, programming and learning symbolic logic (philosophy) seems to affect how your brain handles a number of things, so I'm curious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience PhD student here. Also do a lot of coding. </p>
<p>First, we have to take seriously the proposition that programming languages are literally a form of language. They're not a great 1:1 mapping onto the languages that we speak because they're rather more narrow and don't have as rich of a lexicon or grammar -- most programming languages, by necessity, have a strict grammar structure and relatively few keywords -- but they are still some form of language-like construction, possessing of a grammar structure and words to fill it with, used to express some idea.</p>
<p>But one big difference is that programming languages are derivative and based on a natural language that is learned at some point. Language keywords have a meaning. I'm not really familiar with programming languages that aren't based on English keywords, but I'm sure they're out there (or at least could be). But words like <code>def</code> , <code>var</code>, <code>class</code>, etc. have a meaning and so reading them, even in a programming context, will still activate the part of your brain that deals with written language (aka <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661303001347" target="_blank">the visual word form area</a>). </p>
<p>So there isn't a lot of work that has been done looking at programming languages in particular, but there has been a pretty significant amount of work done on natural vs. artificial languages and what the differences are between learning first and second languages. And there has also been a fair bit of work done on math in the brain. </p>
<p>Taken together, programming is likely to be some mix of the two, leaning heavily on the visual word form area as well as the other areas focused on comprehension of written language, but also relying on some extent on prefrontal areas that are important in planning and mathematical tasks. Little work has been done on this, both for practical reasons (getting a subject that knows how to program things while lying perfectly still for hours on end is nothing short of a miracle, forget the logistical nightmare that would be creating a non-interfering non-ferrous keyboard for them to type on. The mere thought sends chills through my grad student spine) as well as funding reasons (not many people care what the programmer is thinking as long as their pushes seem sane).</p>
<p>tl;dr: it's probably similar, but it will be different in some ways. no one really knows.</p>
<p>I can edit in links to sources if people are interested, but it's late and I'll do it tomorrow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most important distinctions between programming languages and Natural Languages is that they fall under different types of syntax.</p>
<p>Formally, programming languages are context-free languages meaning they can be correctly generated by a simple set of rules called a generative grammar.</p>
<p>Natural languages, on the other hand, are context sensitive languages, generated by a transformational-generative grammar. Essentially that means your brain has to do two passes to generate correct sentences. First it generates the &quot;deep structure&quot; according to a generative grammar, just like for PL. But to form a correct sentence, your brain must then apply an additional set of transformations to turn the deep structure into the &quot;surface structure&quot; that you actually speak.</p>
<p>So generating or parsing natural language is inherently more difficult than the respective problem for programming languages.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm only pointing out what I believe to be the biggest cognitive difference in PL and NL. This difference is rather small and only concerns syntax, not semantics. And there are pseudo-exceptions (e.g. Python). In general, I believe the cognitive processes behind both PL and NL are largely the same, but I don't have anything to cite towards that end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question:</p>
<p>How does the brain handle mathematics differently than natural language? Why does it seem so hard for people to read math?</p>
<p>Could it possibly be easier to learn and develop math if we were to use words instead of symbols?</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie Lamport (Computer Scientist) claims the following:</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the best way to get better programs is to teach programmers how to think better. Thinking is not the ability to manipulate language; it’s the ability to manipulate concepts. Computer science should be about concepts, not languages. But how does one teach concepts without getting distracted by the language in which those concepts are expressed? My answer is to use the same language as every other branch of science and engineering—namely, mathematics.&quot;</p>
<p>Does this statement hold true?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
