I know people thinking the moon landing is fake is an old thing, but lately, it seems like there's a MASSIVE upswing in the amount of people that just want to swear literally every branch of science is complete hogwash, and that any and all accomplishments are 100% fake.</p>
<p>Anyone got any light to shed on why that is, other than just assuming that all these people are trolling, or idiots?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of this has to do with time, and some are about unexamined assumptions, but there's a third component. </p>
<p>First, time.  When we discovered vaccines, the world was a very different place. It was not unusual for most children to die from disease. Whole generations might be decimated by disease. This happened only 100 years ago, I'm not talking about the Middle Ages. </p>
<p>So when we invented vaccination, it saved a whole generation. It was treated as a miracle drug. For the generations who grew up with disease, the prospect of raising the next generation without it was...its impossible to overstate how <em>important</em> it was to the folks who grew up with disease to make sure their children were vaccinated.</p>
<p>But those people weren't <em>smarter</em> than us. They (by and large) did not <em>understand</em> how vaccines work. They just believed the doctors, and they could see the results. But it's not like these people were somehow smarter or wiser than us. </p>
<p>The next couple of generations were still able to talk to the parents, and then eventually grandparents who grew up without vaccines. So there was this generational knowledge that vaccines were hugely important. Again, these later generations did not <em>understand</em> herd immunity, or how vaccines work, but the world before vaccines was still part of living memory.  So they listen to their parents, and grandparents, and vaccinate their kids.</p>
<p>But now there's almost no one left from that last generation that grew up without vaccines. So now we have still widespread ignorance about how vaccines work, that's not new, but we also have no one left alive who paid the price of living without vaccines. No grandparents who can just say, &quot;shut up and vaccinate your kids.&quot;</p>
<p>So to this new generation, the whole idea of vaccination is essentially no different from superstition. And there's a deep distrust running through America towards doctors and science but will get to that after the unexamined assumptions. </p>
<p>Second, unexamined assumptions. Most Americans living today, grew up during times of unparalleled prosperity. Especially if you have parents or grandparents who were alive in the 50s and 60s, where America was the only industrial power left in the world.  Literally every other industrial center in the world, outside America, has been bombed during World War II. So Americans were crazy rich compared to other countries. Even normal middle-class people could afford cars, gas was cheap, everything was cheap.</p>
<p>Now starting around the 1970s the oil companies started to realize that they were having a profound, negative, and therefore dangerous effects on the environment. But, doing anything about it would've been hideously expensive. So they just cover it all up. You know, none of them are going to live long enough to see the results of pouring sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So whatever. </p>
<p>Time passes and it starts to be obvious there's a problem, but the scope of it is not obvious. We have smog, so we create the EPA in the 1970s (thanks Nixon!) and actually the smog problem is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. So that's a problem solved right?</p>
<p>In the 1980s, we discover there's a hole in the ozone layer. You haven't heard about that a while? Well that's because we banned Chlorofluorocarbons and replaced them with hydrochlorofluorocarbons.  And that basically solved the problem!  We should be proud of these things, they show how the federal government is able to affect change. And many of the state governments! Los Angeles had the worst smog in America, so California enacted the most strict emissions policies. But the point is if we work together we can solve these problems.</p>
<p>However, none of these things really required people to do anything different. It's just required some corporations to spend a little more money than they normally spend.  Most of the stuff happened without most people knowing about it! It was perfectly plausible to live through the 1980s and never hear about the hole in the ozone layer, never know what a CFC is how it's different from an HCFC. </p>
<p>Toward the end of the 1980s, it started to become obvious that there was a problem with the global temperature. I remember this because I was in college in the late 1980s and I did a report on global warning. Almost 30 years ago we were talking about this. James Burke, a BBC science reporter did a whole special called After the Warming in like 1989 about what the future was going to look like if we didn't do something. So this isn't a new problem. 'Climate change' is a new term that people invented in attempt to cover up how bad the problem is. Everything getting hotter is obviously bad. But everything merely changing? Well doesn't the climate do that anyway? </p>
<p>The problem with this is, doing something about it it's going to be hugely expensive. It's gonna be expensive on the scale the likes of which no one has ever dealt with before. And it's going to force people to change their lifestyles. They're going to have much less access to things like not just Gasoline, but like plastics. All plastics come from petroleum.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this is going to be getting people to be mindful of how they consume things. But we've now had several generations of Americans who did not have to worry about being mindful about consumption. And these people do not like the idea that the thing they've been doing for several generations, is actually bad. They've lived with this unexamined assumption: it's ok to consume as much of anything as we want, and waste as much as we want.  And they do not want to examine that assumption now, for fear it will turn out to have been wrong! </p>
<p>And, like vaccines, the climate is a big complex thing that most people do not understand. They do not understand the problem.  So they hear other people saying &quot;there's a problem with the climate, you need to change how you behave,&quot; all they hear is one group of people trying to control another group of people. And that's not a fantasy, human beings have been doing that to each other throughout all of human history. The question isn't &quot;do people do that?&quot; The question is are these climate change fanatics actually trying to control how people behave?</p>
<p>So finally, and then I think we get some good news, we have this basic problem that Americans have never liked science. Isaac Asimov wrote back in the 40s that there's a deep deep anti-intellectual streak running through America. There's a great Frank Zappa quote about how Americans fundamentally distrust anything that doesn't have obvious practical value. This includes distrusting science and art. We love technology! Technology is something you put your hand on and see how it solves problems. We love knowing how much movies make! We know that money has practical value, so that's what most of our artistic discourse is about. But very rarely do you ever hear anyone in the news talking about a painting for the sake of the painting. You only ever hear people talking about paintings, when they sell at auction for a lot of money. </p>
<p>There was a thing  in Europe called the Enlightenment, where Europeans were discovering science and it seemed as though science was gonna save the world. But some Europeans, especially a group called the Puritans in England, really did not like the enlightenment and left England to come to America where they could live a simpler, godly life.  They came to America seeking a life that was much less pluralistic. So they didn't have to share a country with, for instance, Catholics. </p>
<p>The Puritans believed the simple life was good. They believed that suffering was good! To the Puritans, disease was sent by God to punish people for wickedness! This is an archetype that we don't really have in America. We tend to view our Puritan ancestors as noble and enterprising. But that's because we are the descendants of those Puritans!  If you watch, for instance, Blackadder from the BBC, they show a much more comical and derisive view of the Puritans. This is the way the people the Puritans left behind thought of them.</p>
<p>So Americans are essentially a nation founded by rich white guys, but settled by religious nutjobs.  The Puritans were OK with technology, technology would do things like increase crop yield, and that is obviously good. They were not super comfortable with science, and as a result of Americans are still deeply distrustful of science. </p>
<p>There have been times in our history when that was less obvious than it is now! Because we confuse technology and science. They are related, but they are not the same thing. During the space race two whole generations of American kids grew up idolizing astronauts, and wanting to be engineers. Engineers, very practical.  But actual scientists? Hmmm...not sure what those guys do, exactly.</p>
<p>So I don't think it's accurate to say we are now, mysteriously, more distrustful of science. We have always been distrustful of science. </p>
<p>When it comes to climate change the good news is that Americans are still affected by what the pope says. Which is kind of amazing for country founded by Puritans, but there you are. And the pope is actually smart dude who went to college and worked as a chemist.  So  when the pope recently came out and said, climate change is real, it's going to screw almost everyone, and it's really really going to screw poor people way way worse than  rich people , Americans actually listened. The tide of opinion is changing. </p>
<p>It's one of the reasons Donald Trump was gobsmacked by the reaction he got to pulling out of the Paris accord. He actually expected a lot of people in America to be very happy with him. He thought he was doing with those people wanted. What he did not realize, is that public opinion has changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The internet.  </p>
<p>Prior to the internet, in order to spew your <del>stupid</del> unscientific ideas about the geometry of the Earth to an audience you'd need to go through a university publication, scientific journal, newspaper, magazine or go through an aggressive self publishing campaign. </p>
<p>During any one of these processes there are peers, editors, technical writers, fact checkers going over your work and saying &quot;you're an idiot, get out of my office&quot; and that's that. It used to be much more difficult to publish unsubstantiated garbage, not to say that it wasn't published. While the barriers to publishing your ideas and being heard is lower than ever, it's has some negative externalities we didn't anticipate as a society.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism" target="_blank">Yellow Journalism</a> did, of course, happen in your tabloid rags, but the public view on these were similar to the views we have of tabloids today. They're great kindling, but that's about it. Occasionally you have an older person that subscribes to the tabloids, but there was never much mainstream push behind it. </p>
<p>With the internet we have two problems...</p>
<p>Firstly, everything is 'equal'. Consider this Google search of &quot;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/EklZRAL.png" target="_blank">NASA approval rating</a>&quot;. One of these is <em>not</em> like the others. </p>
<p>Part of this is due to how advertising priorities have changed. Tabloid newspapers weren't terribly popular among the wealthy and educated, an advertisement in them didn't go very far, even if the people reading it would believe what you're selling, so advertisers stuck to more popular  mainstream news outlets. Today, those motivators don't exist on the internet. Advertisers care less about the kind of people viewing their ads and instead are more focused on raw numbers and clicks; engagement. They don't care from whom or from where, so to advertisers Breitbart and the Wall Street Journal might as well be the same. </p>
<p>Equality extends to appearances as well, tabloids have gotten much better at legitimizing themselves online and appearing more mainstream. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes and is a 165 year old journalistic institution. </p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/" target="_blank">The New York Post</a> is tabloid. </p>
<p>Telling between the two is somewhat difficult if you aren't up to snuff on the history and credibility of journalistic institutions. </p>
<p>This leads quite well into the second problem. </p>
<p><em>Human beings aren't very good at evaluating objective facts.</em></p>
<p>To begin with, we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>, like confirmation bias. </p>
<p>Someone with more objectivity and were less attached to Flat Earth theory they might google 'is the Earth flat?', while someone more invested in Flat Earth theory might google 'Flat Earth proof'. Google is <em>fantastic</em> for someone who wants to confirm things they already believe. </p>
<p>Our emotional investment into our beliefs and facts makes us resistant to things that disagree with our world view and more receptive to things that enforce our world view. This isn't a partisan thing, this is a <em>human</em> thing.  </p>
<p>So you have given creatures that are emotionally, psychologically, sometimes financially, invested in their believes a tool that allows them to find information that confirms their ideas and other people that <em>also</em> believe their ideas. </p>
<p>Being surrounded by a homogeneous group is an  <em>INCREDIBLY</em> powerful way to condition people to behave/believe along with the group. Human beings are, at their most fundamental level, social creatures that feel compelled to be liked and included in groups, and disagreeing with the group is very difficult for a social creature. This is how you can condition perfectly normal Germans to genocide millions of Jews. This is how you get a normal person to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment#Results" target="_blank">shock someone to death in the name of science</a>. </p>
<p>Well, we gave  people a tool to find and create whatever communities they like, and they behaved exactly how our psychological models expected them to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may not be that it is on the upswing, but may that they have a bigger platform. Think vaccines are satan's serum? There is a FB group for that with 1,000 other people agreeing and posting bogus crap to support your idea. Social media has now given everyone a voice and niche to belong to, so this may be more of an issue of a loud voice now versus an actual rise in incidence. Either that orrrrr I could hypothesis there is a disconnect and distrust between the scientific community and the general public. News outlets bastardizing scientific work may be a giant issue, since most average people won't take hours of their life to read and sift through the jargon of a scientific journal of actual publications, and will believe a 5 word headline explain a complex study and then 12 more deny that initial study. Example: &quot;Chocolate causes cancer&quot; and then three weeks later &quot;Chocolate, in moderation, prevents cancer&quot;. </p>
<p>Just some ideas from my experience, I am finishing up degrees in psych and biomedical microbiology and have focused a lot on ethics and the communication of science to the public and these are main points that come up a lot when it comes to denialism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One more explanation: The world changes faster than most non-subject matter expert humans can adapt to it.  One coping mechanism is to deny that the change is happening.</p>
<p>Prior to the Renaissance, every farmer farmed the way his father taught him. The world changed slowly if at all.</p>
<p>A example of the world changing too fast: most scholars concur that Copernicus completed his book on the heliocentric theory of the solar system <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium" target="_blank">On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</a></em> around 1530.  However Copernicus waited until just before his death (1543) to publish it. Why? Because Copernicus thought it would not be accepted and he didn't want to face the resulting sh#t storm from the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Similarly, Albert Einstein never fully accepted the probabilistic nature of Quantum Mechanics.</p>
<p>&quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot;
