		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel prize winning psychologist and economist, discovered the brain has two &quot;modes&quot;, which he calls system 1 and system 2.  System 1 is fast, instinctive and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, more logical, and requires concentration to use. </p>
<p>We have both systems because each is fit for a different purpose. When the lion jumps out of the bush, you don't want to sit down and puzzle out a 13-point action plan.</p>
<p><del>These systems can be manually activated</del> You can help activate these systems by smiling and frowning. Smiling activates system 1, and this is thought to be evolutionary selection to help us get along socially -- quick banter, jokes, being in the moment, and paying attention to multiple things. Frowning activates system 2, and this is thought to be evolutionary selection for rumination -- when something is wrong in your life you need to stop and figure out what needs to change.</p>
<p>Actually it would be more accurate to say that (like many things in physiology) they're activated in a feedback loop. Using system 1 makes you smile which reinforces system 1 which makes you smile which reinforces system 1, and so on. Similarly, using system 2 makes you frown which reinforces system 2. We stay in system 1 most of the time because it requires very little mental energy compared to system 2, which becomes exhausted quickly. Our body is always trying to put us back into system 1; or more accurately, system 1 tends to automatically answer questions before system 2 ever gets a chance, and it takes deliberate effort to ignore your first instinct in favor of puzzling something out.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr We frown while concentrating because it helps us maintain our concentration. More specifically, it's a biological feedback mechanism for activating system 2.</strong></p>
<p>Kahneman wrote about the two systems in his best-selling book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, wherein he also goes into detail on the cognitive biases each system is susceptible to. It's a really good book that can help us catch ourselves in the act, and I'd highly recommend it. You can read a brief summary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman" target="_blank">here</a>, or a more in-depth one on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: /u/lansaman also posted <a href="https://youtu.be/UBVV8pch1dM" target="_blank">a great video</a> on the subject below.</p>
<p>EDIT2: NYT also did a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html?mcubz=1" target="_blank">great summary of the work</a>, and even gets into some of system 1's cognitive biases, as well as other conclusions from the book on the nature of happiness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically you're involuntarily communicating through your gestures that you are concentrating and don't want to be disturbed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A prevailing theory regarding the evolution of language implicates a gestural stage prior to the emergence of speech. In support of a transition of human language from a gestural to a vocal system, articulation of the hands and the tongue are underpinned by overlapping left hemisphere dominant neural regions. Behavioral studies demonstrate that human adults perform sympathetic mouth actions in imitative synchrony with manual actions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a term in psychology for this (I forget for know but I'll search for it) but it was observed in young children first. A neuroscientist noticed that when group of children were learning to use scissors for the first time. A lot of them would make the motions scissors do, but with their mouths. It eventually lead neuron recruitment</p>
<p>Essentially your brain is recruiting as many relating neurons of that related skill to complete the task successfully </p>
<p>I'll look for the term</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Engagement in difficult tasks often causes involuntary changes in not just face muscles but other positional muscles too. Your efforts &quot;overflow&quot; into other areas of the body, since your efforts cannot make your hands be more hands... I hope that makes sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
