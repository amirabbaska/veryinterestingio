		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope, the Sun is not heavy enough to deflect something moving as fast as light that much.</p>
<p>You can however do this with something heavier, a black hole. If you carefully put your light the correct distance away you can get it to orbit circularly around a black hole. This distance characterises something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere" target="_blank">a photon sphere</a> and is 50% further away than the event horizon for a non rotating black hole.</p>
<p>However, this orbit is extremely unstable, the slightest perturbation will cause the light to either spiral in and enter the black hole or spiral out and eventually escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For this to happen, the photon would have to be in a stable orbit at the speed of light. The points in a gravity well where this is possible form the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere" target="_blank">photon sphere</a>, which is 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
<p>In other words, it only exists around black holes and things that are very nearly black holes (such that their radius is less than 1.5 times their Schwarzschild radius), which I guess might be some neutron stars.</p>
<p>By comparison, the sun's Schwarzschild radius is 3km, so you'd have to compress it a radius under 4.5km for a photon sphere to exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also the beam would grow in diameter because no laser is perfectly columnated. We did the math in my engineering class and if you shined a laser at the moon by the time it hit the moon, the diameter of the beam would be larger than the diameter of the moon. (Not to mention, impossible to see because the concentration of the beam is so large)</p>
<p>Awesome question though! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun is not nearly massive enough for its'  gravitational field to affect the laser's trajectory in that way. In fact, the effect of the sun's gravity on the laser would be almost immeasurably small. In order to bend light to the degree you are describing, you would need something billions of times more massive than the sun, namely a black hole or a particularly massive neutron star.</p>
<p>On to the second part of the question: If you could construct a laser which was <em>perfect</em>, meaning all of the photons were traveling perfectly parallel to each other, then it would be visible as more of a laser ellipse, depending on the diameter of the laser dot. The photons passing closer to the sun and therefore being more strongly affected by the gravitational field would arrive back at earth before the ones passing farther away, and on a different trajectory that would be dependent on the distance between the closest and furthest photon streams. Because of this, the laser would appear stretched along the normal axis, and would appear as an ellipse. This is assuming, of course, that none of the light was diffused by the earth's atmosphere, which the vast majority certainly would be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to understand this for a few years now.</p>
<p>As I understand it, light does not contain mass.</p>
<p>Gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass.</p>
<p>Gravity can act on light, which has no mass.</p>
<p>How? If light has no mass, then it should have no weight. And if it has no weight, then it shouldn't be attracted to gravity, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
