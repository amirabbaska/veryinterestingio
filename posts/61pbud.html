<p>It's very different from Google telling websites that user 12345678 has looked at home improvement and having them show you ads for Home Depot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would add... you made a choice to sign up for FB. You <em>need</em> an ISP to get online, by definition; you don't need to give away your information to social media entities. </p>
<p>Either way though, get yourself a VPN like PIA, NordVPN, IPV, etc... get uBlock Origin, uMatrix or NoScript, and RandomAgentSpoofer.</p>
<p>Go forth, and be anonymous from casual spying, although accept that the NSA is all up in your shit and you can do little or nothing about it... but that's ok because like virtually everyone else you're boring and not a national security concern. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real cause how bout getting this president impeached. How bout advocating that people vote locally and not only once every 4 years. If you would've voted in the first place the senate wouldn't be filled with republicans and maybe a bill like this would have no chance to get passed. Instead everyone hops on the bandwagon for any cause they can find that goes really unnoticed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
