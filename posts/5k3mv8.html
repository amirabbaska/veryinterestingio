		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass and is not affected by the lead weights.</p>
<p>What is affected is drag. Loosely speaking, the drag when falling depends on the shape of the object that is falling. Your shape does not change significantly with the lead belt, but your mass does, and the result is that drag becomes less important relative to gravity. For similar reasons you will find that a sheet of paper falls more slowly than the same sheet of paper crumpled up into a ball.</p>
<p>What Galileo found is that when drag is <em>not</em> important, the acceleration of a falling object is independent of mass. This is because, as stated above, the acceleration due to gravity is (to a very good approximation) independent of mass.</p>
<p>Edit: a helpful Redditor suggested the correct term to use here would be &quot;drag&quot; instead of friction. Original edited for clarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Without friction you have no terminal velocity (except the light velocity but that is an other story)<br />
So the terminal velocity occurs because the force of friction (that is proportional to the velocity) becomes equal to the force that pulls you down which is your weight (mass*g). This is how your mass comes into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's all about surface area and total mass.</p>
<p>It's also why tandem skydives (two people) need a small drogue chute to slow them down to normal skydiving speeds.  One person falling on top of another is like twice the mass with just about the same surface area.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tl;Dr: more mass means it takes more drag to counter gravity, so you fall faster to get more drag.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and explain this in as plain language as I can, without getting too much into the math.</p>
<p>That being said, before we start, a recap: </p>
<p>Force = Mass x Acceleration</p>
<p>Therefore Force/Mass = Acceleration</p>
<p>In freefall, you have two main forces acting on you - Gravity (down, or negative) and Drag (up, or positive).</p>
<p>The sum of these forces is your Net Force. If the Force of Gravity is greater than the Force of Drag, you have a net negative force and accelerate down towards earth. If the Force of Drag is greater than that of Gravity, you have a net positive force and accelerate upwards. Where these cancel out perfectly is Terminal Velocity. (Net force of 0)</p>
<p>So if you want to speed up your fall, increase mass and/or decrease drag.</p>
<p>If you want to slow down your fall, do the opposite.</p>
<p>Now, some people are mentioning the Galileo ball-drop, and think this is unintuitive - that is because in his experiment, drag was assumed to be zero. Drag is a product of surface area, velocity, and the density of the fluid being moved through. </p>
<p>If you're in a vacuum there is no force of drag, and EVERYTHING feels the full force of gravity while falling - 9.81 m/s^2 down - and that's it. No counter force. Everything falls the same speed.</p>
<p>Add in air resistance, and everything changes. When you first jump out of a plane, you have zero vertical velocity (I'm ignoring horizontal forces here) and thus no drag. Free falling, you accelerate at 9.81m/s^2. But the moment you begin speeding up, you start getting a little bit of drag force.</p>
<p>Not a lot - just enough to counter a tiny bit of gravity. Your net force gets a little nudge upward. Your acceleration dips to 9.75m/s^2, but you're still speeding up. As you speed up, that drag force continues to grow. You accelerate less and less until you have a net force of zero - the force of drag is equal to the force of gravity, and no force means no acceleration.</p>
<p>Welcome to terminal velocity. Now you have 0 acceleration, so your velocity is constant. Without speeding up, your drag force stops increasing. You're in equilibrium. A balance. Any push one way gets balanced by the other.</p>
<p>Now, you do the same jump, but with a lead weight. Your mass is increased, and the acceleration due to gravity is the same. Force=Mass x acceleration tells us that therefore, the Force that gravity applies must be larger. That means it requires more Drag Force to reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>Assuming you don't increase your surface area, and that you're still falling through air, this means you need more velocity to achieve the higher drag force. Whatever velocity it now takes to make drag equal the increased force of gravity is your new terminal velocity. Thus you fall faster.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
