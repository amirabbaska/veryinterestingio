		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree about the assertion that resonant frequencies are the source of your interpreted mood. Often the supporting arguments dwell on specific chords and don't account for harmonic context.</p>
<p>It is often thought that a major chord is interpreted as &quot;bright and happy,&quot; but what you really mean is that the &quot;major keys&quot; sound bright and happy.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example. There is a chord called the Neopolitan 6th. It is technically a major triad, but if you play this chord in the context of a minor progression (as a traditional N6-V7-i resolution), it doesn't sound happy at all, but moody. This is because of its harmonic context (it is rooted on the flattened 2nd which is harmonically unstable and demands resolution)</p>
<p>Here's some evidence. Moonlight Sonata is a very popular classical piece where this chord is used very early on. Click on this link and play the piece. Where you see the notation &quot;bII 6,&quot; this is the Neopolitan chord. Examine how it feels to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/ludwig-van-beethoven/piano-sonata-no-14-moonlight-1st-movement" target="_blank">https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/ludwig-van-beethoven/piano-sonata-no-14-moonlight-1st-movement</a></p>
<p>Another example would be Dominant chords, which are major triads with a minor seventh. This chord contains not only a major second interval (which is very dissonant) but also an augmented fourth (commonly known as a tritone) between the seventh and third of the chord (also very dissonant). If you prepare this chord properly in a major key, the resulting sound is not dark but bright and pleasant despite its inherent instability.</p>
<p>Here's some more evidence. This is a transcription of the same Moonlight Sonata in a major key. Try to follow along with the link I posted earlier. Every time it says &quot;V&quot; of any sort....this is the Dominant chord. Examine how it feels in this context. Only bother with the first few measures that are present. The rest of the transcription is very awkward.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it has to do with the resonant frequency of the individual chords. Some are extremely pure and propagate linearly while others are really &quot;shaky&quot; and propagate with different types of noise. Think about the difference between someone singing well and someone screeching. The difference has to do with how pure the wave is. </p>
<p>When chords travel, if the individual notes travel perfectly together they are usually the major chords. For the minor chords (or even the chords you make up that sound awful), the individual notes are destructively aligned and create a wave that doesn't propagate perfectly together; instead, the standing chord wave seems to travel backwards as well as forwards due to how the individual waves add up (the pure standing chord wave seems not travel at all). </p>
<p>Our ears simply hear these frequencies and take them to be either pure which sounds good and evokes good feelings, or we hear the minor chords that aren't pure which evoke bad feelings.</p>
<p>Its hard to explain, i hope this comment isnt completely confusing. Im sure someone else can explain it better.</p>
<p>edit 1 and 2: trying to make more sense. Also, i think OP was looking for a biological reason to why this happens, instead of the physics reason which i gave so idk if this is what op was looking for</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Download a piano app, we're going all in.</p>
<p>While it's downloading, think of all the songs you heard or sang as a child.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday or Mary Had a Little Lamb are great examples (and you should look up how to play them when we're done here!)</p>
<p>These songs are in a &quot;major&quot; key, which basically is what we associate with happy in music.</p>
<p>To understand, check out this diagram I made.
<a href="http://imgur.com/3CUdEsu" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/3CUdEsu</a></p>
<p>Play the &quot;major&quot; notes, all white keys, in order. Notice the note labeled B next to the top note, C? This is what gives major keys the sound we love so much: the <strong>leading tone</strong>. Between most notes, you will see a black piano key. But between E and F, along with B and C, we have nothing.</p>
<p>Alone, no two piano keys next to each other have this effect, but because we started on C, the B is <em>leading</em> us into C again.</p>
<p>So basically, major keys make us feel happy and complete.</p>
<p>But within a major key, there is a lot more going on. For example, there are major and minor &quot;chords&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minor chords in a major key? What's going on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes that's right! In fact, within the white keys is another key signature which we call &quot;A minor.&quot; Test it out now and play it through!</p>
<p>You'll notice, unlike in C major, we do not have a leading tone in this sequence of notes (which we call a scale).
You may also notice that these are technically the same notes as before, don't get too hung up on this!</p>
<p>What you need to know is that in these two scales there is one big difference, the leading tone. In minor keys we don't experience the completeness that major keys have to offer, so they sound a lot more ambiguous and we don't know where they're going.</p>
<p>Both key signatures though, use both types of chords (in fact, there are many other types of chords). If you want to play around with this, play alternating notes together (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc) and you'll notice that some sound very different than others. But they're all white keys!</p>
<p>In short, the difference between A minor and C major is where we start. In C major, we want B to move into C. But there's nothing inherently happy about C or sad about A, it's just where we start, and what notes are played accompanying these notes.</p>
<p>Part of our association with these sets of notes is because of sound-waves and how our ears interpret them, and part of it is because we are raised listening to a lot of major sounding music.</p>
<p>We listen to this music because its a lot easier to sing, not because it's inherently happy. So it's kinda confusing.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this didn't make sense, I spent a lot of time on it but I have to acknowledge that I'm only just getting into music education and still have a lot to learn.
I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>Please check out these resources. Do not shy away from music theory, it will only make you enjoy listening to music more!</p>
