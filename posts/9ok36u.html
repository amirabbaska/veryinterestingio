		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is &quot;sort of&quot;, because whilst there are a number of similarities between the oceans and the atmosphere, there are also some important differences.</p>
<p>As you might know, the intensity of light from the sun is <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-617e2b2bbc5ea5fc3676924d8109f457-c" target="_blank">much higher</a> at the equator than at the poles. This creates an imbalance of energy - heat wants to flow from hot places (the equator) to cold places (the poles). To transfer this heat effectively, you need a fluid to transport that heat rapidly, and the two candidates for that on Earth are the oceans and atmosphere. Which is <a href="http://www.climate.be/textbook/images/image\(15\).png" target="_blank">precisely what both do</a>. Motion in the atmosphere is fundamentally driven by this poleward transport of heat, and it's the same for the ocean.</p>
<p>However, if that were the end of the story, there wouldn't be much in the form of weather because a constant transport of heat away from the equator wouldn't result in any differences in time. The reason why we actually have weather (as opposed to relatively static conditions) is largely down to fluid instabilities. You are already probably familiar with the effects of these instabilities, because they're the cause of <a href="https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V7e/forecast/fcst/Data/I04.jpg" target="_blank">high and low pressure systems</a> and weather fronts. The behaviour of these systems, as the name &quot;instability&quot; implies, is chaotic and unpredictable, which is why weather forecasts are not always correct and can usually only accurately predict weather a few days in advance. However, there are certain patterns, for instance particularly high variability at mid-latitudes where the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/gallery/mohippo/images/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/global-circulation-cells.png" target="_blank">meeting of two atmospheric circulation cells</a> creates particularly pronounced fluid instabilities.</p>
<p>So, do we get these instabilities in the ocean as well? Yes, but they look very different. Critically, the size is very different. If you look at a <a href="https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V7e/forecast/fcst/Data/I04.jpg" target="_blank">weather map</a>, you'll notice that the size of most features on the map is on the order of about 1000km across. For instance, it would be very unusual to find a low pressure system that is 100km or 10,000km across. This is why, <em>generally speaking</em>, the kind of weather you get in one particular location will be fairly similar to the kind of weather people a few hours' drive away are having (in the absence of complicating factors like mountains). But in the oceans, this scale is different. The oceanic equivalent of low and high pressure systems, <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/ih/2012/06/cm2.6.png" target="_blank">cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies</a>, are generally smaller than 100km across, down to a few 10s of kilometres towards the poles. This means that the spatial pattern of ocean 'weather' is much more complex than it is in the atmosphere. You can be in a cyclonic cold eddy at one location, and travel an hour or two by boat and end up in an anticyclonic warm eddy. On the other hand, these eddies are often less variable in time than comparable systems in the atmosphere. An eddy can often sometimes last for several months, for instance.</p>
<p>Like the pressure systems in the atmosphere, eddies in the ocean are particularly variable/common in certain locations. For instance, western boundaries of most ocean basins are often occupied by particularly strong currents called western boundary currents (a famous example is the <a href="http://tornado.sfsu.edu/Geosciences/classes/m407_707/Monteverdi/Satellite/Oceanography/eddy_files/image003.jpg" target="_blank">Gulf Stream</a>) and eddies are particularly common around these currents. If you look at <a href="http://www.seos-project.eu/modules/oceancurrents/images/GulfStream_SST_eddies.png" target="_blank">this image</a>, you can really easily see eddies shedding off the gulf stream. You can also quite nicely see the effect that these eddies have on the sea surface temperatures.</p>
<p>What are the effects of these eddies? Obviously there's no rain in the oceans! I've already mentioned this, but one effect is temperatures. Because of the way fluids flow in the ocean, <a href="http://tornado.sfsu.edu/Geosciences/classes/m407_707/Monteverdi/Satellite/Oceanography/eddy_files/image006.gif" target="_blank">water is forced downwards, getting deeper, when an eddy flows one way, and upwards, towards the surface, when they flow the other way</a>. Because water <em>generally</em> cools as you get deeper in the ocean (although this is not true near the poles), when water is forced up (upwelling) you get cooler temperatures at the surface, and when water is forced down (downwelling) you get warmer temperatures at the surface. Eddies can also significantly impact how much life you find. Deeper waters tend to be more nutrient rich, so when eddies result in upwelling, they bring more nutrients to the surface and that can result in more plankton growth. You can see this beautifully in <a href="https://gaubelab.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/czcs_gs.png" target="_blank">this diagram of chlorophyll (the chemical that allows plants to get energy from the sun)</a>.</p>
<p>One last thing that I'll briefly mention is El Nino (also known as ENSO, El-Nino/Southern Oscillation), which you have probably heard of before and is an effect that has really significant impacts on weather around the world. But although weather is the way that most of us experience El-Nino, it is largely caused by variations in the oceans, specifically an oscillation between <a href="http://grimstad.uia.no/puls/climatechange/graphics/04-elninopheno_1_.jpg" target="_blank">sea-surface temperatures across the Pacific</a>.</p>
<p>So, to conclude, the ocean does have phenomena similar to what we call weather in the atmosphere, but they look very different!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a meteorologist/ocean scientist. Atmospheric weather is largely based on high/low pressure air, depending on temperature, causing wind, etc. wind is a current of air. Water will act largely the same according to temperature, creating high/low density spots, resulting in water currents. In this sense they would be similar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean currents and large-scale wind patterns are in many ways similar and both ultimately caused by the sun heating up the earth unevenly.</p>
<p>But the details are quite different, because water</p>
<ul>
<li>is much denser</li>
<li>is much more viscous</li>
<li>has a much higher heat capacity</li>
<li>is liquid rather than gaseous (so non-compressible)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the movements and changes are much slower, so there's nothing like the day/night changes you have in weather. There are maybe some vague similarities between humdity/rain and ocean salinity and sediments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes?</p>
<p>Slightly longer answer: Kind of? We don't know much about the ocean.</p>
<p>The ocean has a lot to it, including differences in salinity (salt), temperature, density, oxygen content, and so much more. You can see <a href="https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/mysterious-underwater-river/" target="_blank">underwater rivers</a> or underwater &quot;Jet Streams&quot; like the one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-N_7cgwHmQ" target="_blank">Finding Nemo</a>. It isn't <em>quite</em> the same as weather, but there are similar patterns. Air is a fluid, after all.</p>
<p>For her project, I'd suggest picking one particular &quot;weather&quot; system in the ocean. The East Australian Current will give her some great images to use, and it'll help her and her friends connect better with the content. But this is something that the foremost experts in the world <em>literally have no idea about.</em> So she's thinking like a real scientist!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
