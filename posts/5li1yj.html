		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The golden ratio is a beautiful mathematical <em>idea</em>, but it doesn't manifest in nature as much as is claimed in videos on youtube or books about the universality and even mystical significance of the ratio. It is 'pop' science, tenuously connected to a wide array of natural processes because people find that idea aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p><em>Mathematically</em>, the golden ratio is fascinating. It is the irrational number with the simplest continued fraction expansion...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and it is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. </p>
<p>Fibonacci numbers <em>do</em> show up in science, in ((almost?) exclusively biological) natural processes, though this relationship also doesn't occur as much in nature as is often claimed. The number of spiral patterns in the arrangements of leaves around branches, petals around flowers, and scales around pine cones are often consecutive Fibonacci numbers - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis" target="_blank">phyllotaxis</a> - and the higher those numbers get the closer the placement of elements around those spirals is related to the golden angle (the golden mean as applied to the circumference of a circle). This arrangement arises because it is the simplest and most efficient way to arrange petals (for example) such that they all get the maximum amount of sunlight with the least amount of work.</p>
<p>In a sense the golden ratio is a lot like a Platonic 'ideal' - the idea that circles (for example) are always just approximations of some ideal perfect circle, that the forms of everything we see in nature are imperfect shadows of pure ideal forms that we cannot perceive directly. In that sense the golden ratio is the ideal, perfect relationship that is approximated in natural forms by the Fibonacci numbers. This leads some people to assume that there must be something universally important about the golden ratio, in the way that ideal-but-inaccessible forms were considered important to ancient Greek philosophers. But such ideas are in the realm of philosophy, not physics.</p>
<p>tl,dr: the golden ratio is fascinating in mathematics as the eventual limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and as an organizing principle in some spiral biological processes. Claims that the golden ratio has some other significance or cosmic relevance might be interesting philosophically, but they have little to do with science.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you have a seed. Deep down in the genetic code of the seed is the simple genetic code that says &quot;have these cells build more of themselves.&quot; If you let all those cells grow, the ratio between old cells and new cells will usually be the golden ratio.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is so common in nature because it is the product of such a simple idea: the ratio between the first thing and the second thing is the same as the ratio between both those things and a third thing. It's what you always get when you tell cells or leaves or branches or scales to just &quot;grow more of yourself.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a good amount of debate but here's the unpopular truth: it doesn't play a big role in nature. There are many things that are close to the golden ratio but it does not crop up all over as is often claimed. Here's an article about the golden ratio in people.

<p>And here's one about it in manmade stuff.

<p>This ratio is the result of trying to maximize efficiency in using space. As she explains, it would be weird if these things <em>didn't</em> exhibit this pattern.</p>
<p>The first part is mostly showing how the pattern occurs in nature, the explanation starts in part 2. The actual biological rather than mathematical explanation is in part 3.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
