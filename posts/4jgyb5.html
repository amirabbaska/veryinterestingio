		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should be made clear that 360 is completely made up, it has nothing to do with circles, only how people have used them in the past. For that matter 100 is not a special number in any way either, so having it be 360 degrees or 100 degrees are both equally arbitrary.</p>
<p>We use 360, because it has a lot of divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360. Each of these numbers is a different way that we can cut up the circle in an exact way. If you have nine people, and you want to cut a pizza, then you need to cut each slice at 40 degrees. This makes computation easy. Especially when you're in a time before the typical division algorithm we all take for granted. Using Roman Numerals, which they did well into the 1400s, it is not easy to divide something by, say, 15. But if you know that you have 360 degrees, then it's easy to just know that 15x24=360. This makes if very convenient to build things or do astronomy when you don't have an easy way to divide. On the other hand 100 only has 9 divisors, so it's no where near as useful.</p>
<p>That being said, the only meaningful way to talk about angles is radians. Degrees or any other measure are totally arbitrary and meaningless, they're just convenient. Radians actual mean something. If you have a circle of radius 1 and you draw an angle coming from it's center, then the number of radians is nothing more than the length of the arc on the circle that this angle makes. This gives a meaningful definition to quantify angles, it makes sense and it should be seen with sadness when you are forced to use some other, inferior system.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from Mesopotamian mathematics along with sundials and many astronomical units. The sun takes roughly 360 days to complete a full circle in the sky and it's based on that. They used a base 12 system (duodecimal), as opposed to our base 10 system. </p>
<p>Bonus fact: You get to 10 by counting fingers and 12 by counting the knuckles on your fingers with your thumb.</p>
<p>Correction: They actually used a sexagesimal system (base 60), the Egyptians used the duodecimal system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The even divisors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.</p>
<p>Whereas the even divisors of 360 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually researched this when I was in high school (I had the same question).  It comes from the Egyptians.  They were some of the first to use trigonometry.  For a while they believed a year was 360 days.  But obviously after a few years farmers started noticing they needed to plant or harvest crops earlier and earlier each year.  So they corrected the calender by adding 5 days of religious celebration each year.  But they still considered a year 360 days.  A year is like a circle.  You follow it far enough you end up at the beginning, just like the seasons.  So when dividing up a circle into degrees the Egyptians went with 360, the number of days in a year.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Ancient Egyptians had a 360 day a year calender (plus 5 days of religious worship), so they divided the circle by 360.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Base 60. Same reason we have 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes to an hour, 24 hours in a day (6x4), 360 days a year (in the original Alexandrian calendar, later reformed to the Julian calendar, which reformed to the Gregorian calendar that we now use today), 30 days in a month (6x5), 12 months in a year (6x2). Same reason mercury boils at 600 degrees Fahrenheit. Same reason people counted to 12 (6x2) on their hands (based on the knuckles, not the fingers). </p>
<p>60 minutes of arc in a circle and 60 arc seconds in a minute. </p>
<p>It's called the sexagesimal system and is ancient. And by ancient I mean ANCIENT. Like before antiquity. Like Sumer and Ur ancient. We've just used it so long and it's worked just fine. </p>
<p>We tried metric time after the French Revolution but it didn't work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
