		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movie audio is designed for theatres, where the action scenes are best heard ear-splittingly loud (or so thinks Hollywood).  Unfortunately this means that turning it down at home to keep the neighbours happy makes the dialogue too quiet.  If you have a surround sound system, try turning up the volume on the front centre channel; that's where the dialogue is usually played.  I find this works well.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some TVs and receivers have a compression option.  This just adjusts the volume automatically, turning it down during loud passages and up during the quiet ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alot of times this is down to the audio mix. 5.1 vs stereo. Tvs usually take stereo (2 channels of audio, left and right).
Cinema and speaker systems can take 5.1 surround sound (6 tracks of audio).
This volume change is due to the 5.1 being mixed down to stereo on your TV. So it's putting these 6 channels, flattening them down to two channels and then this causing it not be fmthe ideal mix .
This might not be the case all the time but this can cause it. I've noticed this happening with downloading, all the files seem to be 5.1 (6channels)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>TLDR
Because movie theaters are like that and many people at home want movie Theatre sound. </h2>
<p>There's a lot of bad answers here. I'm a recent film school graduate, and I just got done mixing my major film in a mixing room, with one of those cool huge mixing desks and a teacher who has worked in the industry for over 40 years mixing sound in films.</p>
<hr />
<p>So dynamic range in sound is the difference between the quietest stuff and the loudest stuff. A good example is if you turn on the radio, there is almost no dynamic range. They &quot;compress&quot; the songs so that everything is as loud as possible. The problem is, a symphony isn't made for that. If you sit down for an orchestral performance, it gets <em>loud</em>. Then, everything might drop out and leave just a quiet, lonely oboe on stage, and you want to lean in to hear it. It makes everything feel alive, and real.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people who love movies want to experience them as intensely as possible. One of my friends has the biggest TV I've ever seen in his live, along with a 5.1 surround system and every time we watch a movie, he turns it up as loud as he can. We watched Detroit last night, and when a gun is fired let me tell you holy shit you could feel it. It's incredibly immersive.</p>
<p>As a general rule, when mixing sound for film your goal is to mix for those people. You want to mix for the most immersive, theatrical experience possible. There are so many people that have crazy sound systems and projectors in their houses,  and you want to deliver the best content for those crazy avid film fans.</p>
<p>The problem comes when you're not one of those people, or you live in an apartment and have neighbors and can't be too loud, or maybe you have family trying to sleep. These things make you <em>feel</em> like the volume is too loud, even if it might not be too loud for you. It's just too loud for where you are. Then you have to turn the volume down, but the quietest parts of the movie were designed for the volume to be higher. So then, because you lowered the volume to make the loudest stuff not as intense, the quiet stuff is not even legible.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think movies will change. There are too many people who actively want the currently level of dynamic range, and would get angry if you stopped.</p>
<p>The easiest solution, if you're not obsessed with the sound quality or don't live somewhere where you can really enjoy the dynamic range, most sound systems have a built in compressor.</p>
<p>You can just change the settings on your TV so that it will bring up all of the quiet bits and make them louder! The thing that makes me frustrated is how little they advertise this or teach you how to when you buy the TV or sound system.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant invention, because those of us who love dynamic range can still enjoy it, and those who don't can just change the settings on their TV. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Worked in TV/Movie industry for a few years and did a fair amount of editing in post + transcoding, etc. Basically a surprising number of editors in video are pretty mediocre (or worse) in terms of audio science so their audio levels/balance are shit.</p>
<p>Also, as others mentioned, original sound formatting is often compressed and then becomes extra shit.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, it's stuff straight from the content creators/producers which is often at fault.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran into some 7.1/5.1-&gt;2.0 conversions losing a lot of the voice, because it was mixed completely into the center channel; which doesn’t exist in 2.0/2.1.</p>
<p>Others have made some good comments on here, so I’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>I do have to disagree about limiters and compression though. Depending on how they are set up, they can “crush” the dynamic range without ruining sound quality. It’s not perfect, but better than fiddling with the volume knob through the whole movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
