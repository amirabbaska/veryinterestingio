		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few factors for which bleed, from the size of the wall if it's cystic to the place it is (how thick your skin is there)</p>
<p>But basically, you can imagine each of your pores as a ziplock full of peanut butter floating in a pool. If you try to squeeze out the peanut butter, especially if you don't open the ziplock first, you risk popping the bag, getting poolwater in your ziplock and/or peanut butter in your pool</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pimples that don't bleed tend to be really close to the surface and the skin is usually prety healed up around them.  These don't bleed because they're in the epidermis (top layer) or the very top of the dermis (2nd layer).  These parts of the skin don't have a lot of blood in them. Also, the inflammation is usually already gone. </p>
<p>On the other hand, bleeders are usually the big, deep, tender pimples or fresh ones. These are in a deeper part of the dermis, where there's more blood to begin with. Also, inflammation brings liquid with it.  When you squeeze out a pimple, you might notice some clear fluid along with the blood and pimple gunk. This is a sign that the blood vessels in the area are leaky (also because of inflammation).  Squeezing the area to death can result in squeezing out blood vessels as well as pimple goo. </p>
<p>Tldr: little, healed pimples don't bleed because they're healed. Big, new, or inflamed pimples bleed because inflammation brings in blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I have done so many dermatology electives in medical school for this one question.</p>
<p>Comedones or acne, form in the skin from a couple of factors:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Fatty acids from acne bacteria  </li>
<li>Your body maxing sebum that is more scaley  </li>
<li>Inflammation factors from the agitated immune system  </li>
<li>Male hormones  </li>
<li>Smoking  </li>
<li>Milk products  </li>
</ul>
<p>The pores that produce sebum are a kind of gland cell that ruptures and pours out all it's contents. If it gets inflammed it makes a closed comedone or a whitehead.
If it gets clogged in the outlet, you get more blackheads or open comedones.
Sometimes the material that gets stuck dries up, but the sebum gland keeps adding to it underneath. When you &quot;pop&quot; the blackhead you tear the skin holding it in and bleed a bit.
With whiteheads if they have enough of a layer of skin on them they need a good effort to pop, and that effort ruptures the blood vessels to the skin, or the blood vessels in muscles that attach to the skin (lip muscles, chin muscles, forehead muscles) that have a blood supply right near the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
