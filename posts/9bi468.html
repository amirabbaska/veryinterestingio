		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It acts the same way. Your Blood vessel lining contains special enzymes which, when in contact with your blood starts what we call primary hemostasis, which activates the platelets to connect and block the biggest amount of blood from escaping before the nearby Proteins and enzymes nearby are activated to form a fibrin-net and can completely block the wound opening (secondary hemostasis) Just because its wet, doesnt interfere with the clotting as is doesnt require oxygen to work or &quot;dry out&quot; or something</p>
<p>EDIT: corrected primary and secondary hemostasis thanks to u/creativename1998</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the other poster said the wet environment doesnt change anything really. Our saliva is actually a very good antimicrobial for our own bodies.</p>
<p>However when it comes to foreign contaminants we should be careful. Another major thing with healing in the mouth is pressure. That why following an extraction it is important not to smoke (dragging of the cigarette) and drinking from straws or vigorous rinsing of the mouth as this suction and physical action can dislodge the newly forming clot and can disrupt first intention healing, leading to alveolar osteitis or dry socket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood coagulates, it doesn't just dry out. Platelets in the blood rush to the damaged area and help to plug the hole, while clot factor enzymes begin to clot up the blood around the damage. </p>
<p>If it's in air it will eventually dry out forming a hard scab. If it's in a moist environment a scab is still formed, but it's more like a membrane over the injury instead of a hard scab. IE flexible and it can stretch. </p>
<p>Sometimes this soft scab can come off during eating, and if it causes new bleeding, a new scab is formed, and if it's repaired enough not to bleed, then a full scab may not form, but there are other things in a scab than just blood, so it may still ooze and form a new cap. </p>
<p>Think about the difference between what happens when you paint with watercolor, versus oil based paints. Water color paint sets when the water evaporates. But with oil paints, the oil doesn't evaporate. It stays wet, and would stay wet for a very long time, except that sunlight and heat cause the oil to polymerize which takes the short carbon chains in the oil, and starts linking them together, making longer, polymer chains that give it structure and harden the oil. </p>
<p>Blood is like the oil paint, it hardens because of structural changes, rather than just drying out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this will blow your mind, but you can bleed inside your body all the time--its wet in there like 100% of the time. Now, it usually doesnt get to the point of bleeding as a regular person might associate the term with. But, sometimes your body need to plug a little break. If you dont have enough of the clotting material(s)--sometimes because something went wrong and you used them all up--then you can actually get into a really bad situation where you have little bit of bleeding, but all over your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
