		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As luck would have it, I tested this exact question two weeks ago.  I homebrew and wanted to figure out the fastest way to evacuate glass brewing vessels.  A couple of disclaimers before I begin:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It was VERY VERY ROUGH TESTING.  I was testing this by myself, by hand.  There's likely a Â±3 second variance in my measurements based on how long it took me to start the timer and start pouring.</p>
</li>
<li>The vessels used were the standard 5 gallon glass jugs used in homebrewing.  I filled the same jug up to the same line every time.  It was mostly full. It was a roughly 1&quot; throat.  I would assume that results may vary depending on vessel geometry.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I tested the following methods to empty the vessel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flipping it upside down and letting it &quot;Glug&quot; </li>
<li>Letting it pour in as steady of a stream as possible</li>
<li>Flipping it upside down for half the volume, then pouring it in a steady stream.</li>
<li>Flipping it upside down and swirling it in a horizontal plane to create a vortex</li>
<li>Inserting a rigid straw-like tube (a racking cane) to create a dedicated air flow channel</li>
<li>(Don't repeat this!)  Inserting a tube and blowing in CO2 at a VERY LOW PRESSURE.
Each one was tested 3 times, typical variation was 2-3 seconds. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are my results:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Upside down:  1 minute, 12 seconds.  </li>
<li>Steady Pour:  2 minutes, 30 seconds or greater.  It's very difficult to do this from the beginning, since with a full vessel you can only slightly tilt it without glugging.  The projected throat area is very small as a result and the flow is very very slow.  This approach was very problematic and yielded very inconsistant results.  </li>
<li>Hybrid pour: (upside down for half, then steady pour for half):  1 minute, 18 seconds.  Surprisingly close to just having it upside down.  Not a significant difference considering estimated variation in timing.  </li>
<li>Vortex pour:  45 seconds.  Very interesting.  When I first heard about this method I assumed I'd have to swirl the vessel constantly, but after the vortex is established it maintains itself.  </li>
<li>Rigid air tube: 38 seconds.  As assumed, this was very fast, though it was awkward to hold the tube at the same time (air tube was roughly 1/4&quot; diameter, for reference)  </li>
<li>Low pressure CO2 (DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS):  Roughly 23 seconds.  As predicted this was the fastest, but the considerable risk of exploding the vessel makes it NOT WORTHWHILE.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Other notes:<br />
-It takes roughly 2-3 seconds to establish a vortex<br />
-It would be interesting to investigate the flowrate throughout the test; I'd assume that the smooth pour is the fastest when the vessel is nearly empty.<br />
-Bleeding CO2 into a glass container is extremely dangerous, don't try this.  I knew the risks to myself and my equipment and took appropriate precautions so you wouldn't have to.  It's seriously not worth the saved time.<br />
-Comparative results likely only be valid for this particular bottle geometry and fluid viscosity.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Upside down is faster, but the plopping makes it slow.</p>
<p>Water picks up speed as well - the longer you can keep pouring it, the faster it can go. When it's interrupted by the plopping, it has to start over again, and starts from zero.</p>
<p>However, if you can get air in there, without plopping, you're golden.</p>
<p>The shape of the bottle makes a difference, of course, but with most bottles, you can simply make a little whirlpool - give it a quick twist, and air can come up the middle of the vortex.</p>
<p>Of course, now the water isn't rushing straight out, but is running around in circles before it comes out - but mostly it'll still be faster than pouring sideways.</p>
<p>For the fastest pour ever, stick a straw up there, and give it a little blow as you turn the bottle upside-down.  That's the fastest way to empty the bottle, ever.</p>
<p>**EDIT: yes, I understand that if you dynamite the bottle from orbit with radioactive laser-sharks, it'll empty faster - that's just outside of the scope of the question and answer. - except the nitrogen! That was hella cool!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fastest method, if it's a plastic bottle, is to turn it upside down and then jam a knife into it to create a bunghole.  But, since you're 5, you should get a parent to do this for you.  </p>
<p>EDIT: The second sentence was joking, but I was being serious in the first.  The &quot;plopping&quot; occurs because air cannot fill the space created by the exiting liquid, creating a lower pressure zone inside the container (water doesn't compress much).  Creating a hole for the air to flow into makes for much faster draining of the liquid, this is why large containers sometimes have a hole on the top as well as a spigot.  This hole is actually, unjokingly, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunghole" target="_blank">bunghole</a>.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tested using (larger) 1L water bottle with standard (small) opening. </p>
<p>UPsidedown &quot;glug&quot; test: 14.313 seconds. </p>
<p>Pour angle test: 15 flat.
(note: you could do it faster, but to REALLY have a smooth pour without 'glug glugs' it takes longer) </p>
<p>Swirl: Varies greatly depending on technique.
The fastest time was 7.5 seconds, average was around 10. </p>
<p>If you &quot;continue&quot; the swirl motion it goes faster, but if you begin the vortex and stop it's slightly slower. </p>
<p>AGAIN: this is with a larger bottle than normal (1 L) with a normal water bottle opening, your milage may vary. All rights reserved. SORRY TENNESSEE! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick tip along these lines: ever wonder why a bottle of motor oil is asymmetric, with the neck aligned with one side of the bottle?  So you can pour it into the engine, with the neck <em>on top</em>, and it'll pour without glugging.  If you pour with the neck on the bottom, or just flip it upside down completely, best case it'll take forever to empty, worst case it'll splash all over the engine block.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
