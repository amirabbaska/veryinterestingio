		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human, white, European, Slavic, Eastern European, South Slavic, Serbian, Sandzak, Raska, Bosniak, Novi Pazar, North Novi Pazar, Rastoder, Rifat Rastoder.  Some of those labels are absolutely meaningless to you.  The person described may shrug them off, or threaten you with violence for mistaking a him for another grouping.  An uneducated person in America would likely describe this person as &quot;some kind of Russian?&quot;  </p>
<p>As you grow older, you will hopefully learn that context is important, and your mental model of how the world is divided up isn't the only way to see things.  But that requires some level of maturity and breadth of experience that not every one achieves or is interested in. It is much more comfortable to fit the world's square pegs into your round holes by sawing off the corners that don't fit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're referring to ethnic classifications under the United States census.</p>
<p>The census classifications change based on the wants and needs of the United States government at the time.</p>
<p>At varying times the census has included options such as &quot;Chinese&quot; (for all Asians), then separate options for &quot;Japanese,&quot; and &quot;Hindu (for Indians),&quot; &quot;Mulatto,&quot; &quot;Quadroon,&quot; Octoroon,&quot; &quot;Mexican,&quot; among others. Increased immigration from other Asian countries, for example, prompted the government to separate out Japanese from the Chinese, for example.</p>
<p>Filipinos and other Pacific Islanders were probably separated out because the United States controlled the Philippines for quite some time, and also still controls many Pacific Island states.</p>
<p>Alaskans were separated out in 1940 but I don't know what could have prompted that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ideas of race are mostly made up, with a strong emphasis on superficial traits and a weak basis from genetics, linguistics, and culture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These racial descriptions are wholly cultural and relative. For example, in the UK sometimes people from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan (the Indian subcontinent) are described as Asians, while what Americans call &quot;Asians&quot; (people from Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and sometimes Vietnam) are called East Asians. In the USA, people from the Indian subcontinent are not commonly referred to as &quot;Asians&quot; even though everyone knows that they are technically Asian. Same for Middle Easterners.</p>
<p>These descriptors are for convenience to refer to large groups of people based on cultural recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Racial divisions are completely arbitrary and dependent on cultural precedent. Different people from different parts of the world will conceptualize race differently.</p>
<p>The racial descriptors present in the US census are an attempt to draw a clean line between all the ethnic groups of people that may be living in the country for the sake of collecting data, but they're obviously not perfect, since they (to provide a few examples) ignore indigenous peoples from outside the US, lump everyone in Asia save Russians and Middle Easterners into one group, and roll Arabic people into the &quot;white&quot; category, which some Arab immigrants aren't pleased about.</p>
<p>You'll never find a system of racial classification that makes everyone happy, since race is a cultural phenomenon, not an objectively measurable biological one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Filipinos are Asian, there's absolutely no debate here and I don't know where you heard otherwise. Now they'd be classified as Southeast Asians, along with a bunch of other countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, etc. But that's not different than China, Korea, Japan being classified as East Asians. Still all Asians.</p>
<p>As far as Hawaiians, well they're not called Asians because... they're not Asians? Hawaii is thousands of miles away from Asia, right in the middle of the Pacific. Really about as close to the United States as it is to Asia.</p>
<p>Also I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant no offense by it, but that statement &quot;What's the point of the Pacific Island Race?&quot; is very culturally insensitive. Many Pacific Island natives have <strong>very strong and proud</strong> Pacific Island heritage and traditions that they identify as their own distinct group. Lumping them in with Asians is not only grossly inaccurate but diminishes their own heritage, as if they're not worthy of their own designation. No, Pacific Islanders are distinctly their own group and trust me, as someone who is South Korean but raised in Hawaii, to think for a second that &quot;eh, it's all kinda the same right?&quot; is just outright laughable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
