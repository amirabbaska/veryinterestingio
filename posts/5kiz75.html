		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the current tuning system we use in the Western World (and basically anywhere else outside of tribal, colloquial, folkway or other regional music) is the tonal system. This system was set up to give notes (or pitches, actually) the same equidistant relationships between each other within a tuning system known as equal temperament. That is to say, within any octave of an instrument or an instrument tuned to another instrument, there will always be 12 equally separated pitches, what we musicians know as half-steps or semitones, these pitches are always 100 cents (just a division of frequencies) apart from one another. If a pitch is played or sung that is even a few cents off from the tuning pitch as written or perceived, our ears perceive the sound as being dissonant or &quot;off-key.&quot; </p>
<p>To answer your second question, because of equal temperament's hold on music today, the human ear has become used to its clarity within music. If a note is sounded that doesn't fit into the system, our ears know what's up. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Because of a system called equal temperament which standardizes which pitches sound &quot;correct&quot; to the human ear.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone can elaborate more fully, but with tonal centers and leading tones, (basic concepts within music theory) our ears tend to be able to tell where the note should go. Deeper in this is what our ear is accustomed to with Western music. When a note doesn't fit or go the right way, we can pick up on it. The concept of what is right is based off what we are used to hearing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to contribute by saying that you probably mean western music, where 12 separated pitches are used. This is to say that there are different systems in the world where many more pitches are used. A song doesn't nessecarily have to sound off-pitch, if the listener comes from a culture where many more pitches are used in their music. </p>
<p>It isn't the pitch itself, but rather the interval between them that makes them sound &quot;off&quot;. We clearly pick up on a perfect fifth, because of it's properties of sounding very clean, compared to a major third, which sounds more muddled and it colours the music very well. </p>
<p>The western pitch system as explained very well by @nathan594 is rationally divided, which makes the frequencies to be more in line with eachother. </p>
<p>Now that you have some meat on your bones, the answer to your question is basically that notes that sound &quot;off&quot; are dependent on what we are used to hearing. Someone who listens mainly to pop music, might not expect a minor second interval between instruments as much as a musical conductor might, because of the majorly different styles. So, even in our own culture we have major differences when it comes to what's determined &quot;off-pitch&quot; by our ears!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a science behind it that explains harmonics.  Most sounds are comprised of a combination of 'notes' at different frequencies, which define their sound. For instance, bass is typically somewhere in the 20-200hz range (hertz=cycles per second)</p>
<p>So at 1hz, you hear on tone per second.
If you couple this with another tone, the must align to be in 'key'.
The human voice projects different notes simultaneously.<br />
So lets say a person sings a note, it will have a bass property and an alto property.<br />
The bass is at 60hz, so the alto needs to be at a multiple of this harmonic range, let's call it 60Mhz.    </p>
<p>If the bass note was at 60Hz, and there was another bass notes at 100hz, they would not be aligned and would be noticeably crappy.<br />
The second bass note would need to be at 120hz, or 180hz, etc. </p>
<p>TL;DR
tones together need to be mathematically compliant<br />
look up harmonics</p>
<p>edit: harmonics has nothing to due with a 'system' ... it's math</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
