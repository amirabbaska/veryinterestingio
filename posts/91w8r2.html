		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your muscle fibers basically start “sticking” to each other. Chronic continuous stress on muscles creates microtearing. The muscle continues to lose elasticity through stresses, dehydration and weird positions when untreated. They tighten and contract even when typically at rest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up to people looking for definitive answers. Truth is, right now we don't know the exact mechanisms at play nor the causes of &quot;knots.&quot; Most of the info going around now is educated guess at best.</p>
<p>Recent research has it pointing towards our <em>fascia,</em> a tissue that holds our muscle fibers in place and separates them from other organs. The belief is that our fascia might develop tight points. This will commonly cause radiating pain in other areas in the same fascia. It somewhat might explain why manual therapy or foam rolling in certain areas might induce sensation in other areas, especially around joint structures. What's interesting is that we have new developing research showing that there is a type of <em>full-body fascia</em>, enclosing the entire body musculature in a single wrap. If this is true along with the rest of the fascial theories, then that means a simple knot in one area can influence any other area in the body, even the opposite end (such as your right leg affecting your left shoulder). All interesting science!</p>
<p>However, we still don't know if this is entirely true. We do know that myofascial release (foam rolling or any pressure massage) have been able to alleviate some of this pain and &quot;loosen&quot; the knot. But that alleviation might just simply be a temporary &quot;numbing&quot; effect masking the problem. It explains why people need repeated treatments to deal with the same knot.</p>
<p>The most beneficial thing you can do to deal with potential &quot;knots&quot; is simply to exercise and train your entire body. Stronger and active muscles will always be good for you and in many cases will expose these supposed knots to actually just be weak muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't actually know. Anyone here who claims to know is BSing. It has been studied extensively, we think it has something to do with the nervous system causing your muscle to &quot;knot up&quot; instead the muscle itself cauing it.</p>
<p>We can correlate different things to a muscle knot (injury, bad posture, stress, etc) but we don't know what it is a cellular or physiological level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical therapist here. Muscle “knots” or trigger points, or at times, adhesions, can occur secondary to multiple things. It can occur as a protective mechanism after an injury that leaves a joint unstable. It can occur adaptively after prolonged maintenance of poor posture- forward shoulders and head can lead to tightness of chest and upper neck, carrying lots of tension in the traps can lead to levator scapulae triggers. It can also occur due to electrolyte imbalances, although I suppose these are more of “twitches”, really, although they can cause a sustained contraction-like effect. Treatment can consist of spray and stretch using a vapo coolant spray and stretching, localized ischemia using pressure (often fingers via simple pressure or massage), or heat to relax muscle fibers. Pressure works by way of occluding blood flow to a muscle, thus forcing it to relax. As someone who performs manual therapy often, I can say that at times this pressure works very effectively, as does heat via ultrasound. Not well versed in vapocoolant spray. Best bet is to fix your posture, sleeping positions, and find a significant other that is competent in working out your “knots”! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a huge expert on this but form what I know the most accepted cause of a muscle knot is a myofascial trigger point. In between your muscles, there are tissues known fascia that help to deliver nutrients to your muscle and helps to mitigate force dispersion on your joints and muscles. Occasionally this connective tissue can have trouble giving a certain area the required nutrients and as a result the neuromuscular connection can be fatigued or malnourished. This presents itself as a pain in a very specific point of the muscle. Usually these trigger points occur when there is a lot of metabolic overload for the muscle. If you are really working those muscles they are metabolically more demanding and there is a small chance of muscles having trouble with getting the blood they need, these areas will get lose blood and thus less nutrients which can then inhibit the neuromuscular connection to that muscle fiber(the motor plate needs sodium, potassium and calcium to function). Someone could probably explain it much better but that’s just what I’ve read about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
