		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Zoologist here; both points aren't <em>quite</em> true, I'm afraid - or, at the very least, they're misleading simplifications of processes that are a lil' bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Lobsters exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_growth" target="_blank">indeterminate growth</a> meaning, at least at first glance, they should keep growing and growing throughout their entire lives. However, unlike us with our fleshy meat sack bodies, they're trapped within a hardened carapace which must be shed as they grow. This moulting process requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required. More often than not, <strong>big ol' lobsters simply die from exhaustion</strong> during the moulting process.</p>
<p>But if they do survive, eventually their available metabolic energy peters out and they stop being able to moult full stop. In other words, they get too big to eat enough to 'save up' for another stage of growth, only managing to consume enough to maintain their current bodies. At this point, without a chance for renewal via growth, everyday bumps and scrapes add up to increasing damage of their shell, resulting in anything from <a href="https://www.accessscience.com/content/epizootic-shell-disease-in-lobsters/BR0720152" target="_blank">shell disease</a> - where bacteria gets inside and infects the vulnerable lobster underneath - to their shells literally rotting away around them. </p>
<p>So they do keep growing, until they don't, and then they're unable to renew their bodies. As for their biological ageing, <em>no</em> organism dies of 'old age' - or rather, it's a bit meaningless. What happens is that there's simply a strong relationship between increasing age and causes of mortality such as organ failure, reduced immunity to infectious disease, cancer and the like. When we say someone died of old age, they really died of something like cardiovascular disease - it's just that their old age contributed to their body's reduced ability to maintain said organ. </p>
<p>In which case, sure, <strong>lobsters <em>do</em> die of old age</strong> - via carapace infection or something; y'know, not the sort of 'old age' that humans die from. It's true their cells do age 'slowly' and can 'remain youthful' for a surprisingly long amount of time - so organ failure and the like isn't such a problem, and why they're often (slightly erraneously) thought of as 'immortal'. But nonetheless they'll still succumb to something associated with increasing size n' age, unlike the few genuinely biologically immortal animals like the <em>Hydra</em> or <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em> jellyfish.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Sorry y'all, I don't know what'd happen if we undertook the manhattan project of lobster longevity research and tried to keep one alive artificially. Probably something involving frustrated graduate students, unimpressed ethics committees and a megazoidberg monster. Anyone with a whole loada' spare time fancy starting a kickstarter and find out?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been some super massive lobsters that have been caught. The largest recorded lobster was 44 pounds! That's a big lobster!</p>
<p>As the lobster gets bigger it's going to need to eat more to sustain itself, at some point it's not going to be able to eat the extra that it needs to grow and it will reach it's max size. If you gave it a crazy amount of food you could probably get it crazy big, but a 44 pound lobster is pretty damn big!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that 'dying of old age' is sort of misleading.  No one actually dies of old age.  </p>
<p>Rather, you die from 'an increasing likelihood of complications arising from the conditions that accumulate with age'.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine biologist here maximum lobster sizes (and therefore ages) seen today <em>may</em> not reflect the maximum possible for the species. Lobsters have been fished intensively for a long time, and the rest of the ecosystem has changed around them.  As noted elsewhere, the maximum lobster on reliable record is 44lbs (and about 4 feet long), but colonial era reports state that lobsters of 5 and 6 feet were being caught....and those would have been who knows how old.  We don't know how reliable these were, but the phenomenon of shifting baselines is well documented in marine ecosystems, and the largest specimens known today may well be a bit shrimpy compared to the largest possible.  So one answer to OP's question may be: we don't see the big ones because we catch them all.  </p>
<p>As tea_and_biology says &quot;doesn't die of old age&quot; is a bit misleading, but invertebrates can live a long time.  For example, we know that everyday ordinary sea urchins can live more than 200 years...you can tell by using the radioactive signal left by atomic bombs.  There's no telling how long many worms and soft bodied things live since there's nothing permanent to mark the passage of time.  But I suspect quite a few invertebrates can just keep ticking on for ages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
