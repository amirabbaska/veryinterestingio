<p>So the higher elements are formed inside Super Novae and then spewed out into the galaxy where they mix with other clouds of matter that eventually became our solar system and planet. So they have been around for billions of years before and billions of years since becoming part of the Earth. But why are they so dense in just this one area and why are they in the form of mud?</p>
<p>Also, how likely is it that there are many more of these yet to be discovered?</p></div></div>

<p>Most of the more concentrated rare earths to come to the surface likely came via volcanos, which in the ocean likely resulted in a lot of dust laced with the stuff that just got carried off by currents (as opposed to the harder-to-process solid rock found on the surface without the constant abrasive effects of the ocean.)</p>
<p>Japan only surveyed their exclusive economic zone and found a lot, so chances are similar deposits coat the ocean floor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is the rare earth elements here come from hydrothermal vents and volcanic activity under water. Once they have entered the sea water they are then absorbed by biogenic calcium phosphates, which are minerals precipitated by various marine organisms. These minerals accumulate on the ocean floor with other deep sea muddy sediment. The reason they are in such high concentration here is likely due to the proximity to hydrothermal activity and comparatively low sedimentation rates of non REE-bearing sediments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have addressed the formation issue (they've left out the possibility of bioacculumation, but that's another topic)</p>
<p>I'd like to point out that this is far from a &quot;new&quot; discovery.</p>
<p>I've copied <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/8bwvea/a_massive_semiinfinite_trove_of_rareearth_metals/dxajh5s/" target="_blank">my comment from a few days ago</a> when this came up in a different sub.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They used to say similar things about the manganese nodules found all over the ocean floor, sometimes in high concentrations.  Those also include <a href="https://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-3/mineral-resources/manganese-nodules/" target="_blank">large amounts of nickel, copper, titanium, cobalt, and more</a>, often in much higher concentration than in any terrestrial ore supply.</p>
<p>In fact this &quot;new&quot; find looks like it's in an area that's been know to have high concentrations of metals for decades (compare the maps) and this article is a mainly a refinement of earlier work.</p>
<p>The nodules are much easier to harvest than the mud this article refers to, but despite people having been working on it since the 1970s no economically feasible method has been developed.</p>
<p>That's entirely leaving out the environmental impacts of strip-mining the ocean floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, we've known about large mineral deposits on the ocean floor both in mud and in hard nodules for a long time.  We've known about them in that particular area for quite a while as well.  The linked article includes a map and you can see just how widespread these deposits are, they're basically global in extent, not just in that one area.</p>
<p>Regarding this particular deposit, it's <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rare-earth-elements-ocean/" target="_blank">unlikely to be mined or accessed any time in the foreseeable future</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To access the rare earths at site 1222, for instance, would require pulling up the top 70 meters of seafloor sediment, filtering out the water content, removing the valuable rare earths (which make up less than one part per thousand of the sediment) and returning the rest of the material to the seabed.</p>
<p>Such an undertaking would require new technology, a long permitting process—and, of course, a lot of money. So there would have to be a significant economic incentive to access the seafloor resource. &quot;That's why I'm not sure the rare earth elements are enough in themselves to provide that,&quot; says James Hein, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. After all, the global rare earth market is relatively small—it currently runs about $2 billion to $3 billion annually, according to a recent report from Ernst &amp; Young, whereas the markets for metals such as copper are dozens of times larger. &quot;I'll be surprised, really, if this gets much attention as a resource potential in the near term,&quot; Hein says. &quot;The grades really are just not very high, and the environmental issues will just be so great.&quot;</p>
<p>At depths of 4,000 to 5,000 meters, seafloor ecosystems are not well understood, nor are the potential impacts of large-scale dredging on those ecosystems. &quot;Essentially, this would be a strip-mining operation where they would be sucking up lots of sediments from the seafloor over large areas,&quot; says Craig Smith, a professor of oceanography at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, &quot;which would of course destroy the communities that reside there.&quot; Those ecosystems, to the extent that they have been explored, have low biomass but high biodiversity. And, having taken hold in a stable environment, they are not adapted to large-scale disturbances.</p>
<p>&quot;Four thousand meters in the deep ocean is a long way down, and we don't know how to mitigate against significant environmental impacts or how to restore the ecosystem, if you can even restore the ecosystem,&quot; says Cindy Van Dover, an oceanographer at Duke University. &quot;We don't understand a lot about what is going on down there from an ecological standpoint.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of the sites sampled by the Japanese researchers are in international waters and would fall under the jurisdiction of the International Seabed Authority, based in Jamaica, which means any mining concern looking to extract seafloor rare earths would likely face a long regulatory process. &quot;Doing things there is a very slow and considered process,&quot; Van Dover says. &quot;Things don't happen overnight in international waters.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's not addressing the major environmental issues at stake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out that 'rare earths' are not, strictly speaking, 'rare'. Cesium, for example, is more common than copper, and we seem to have lots of that. However, the rare earths are hard to separate from other materials, and don't occur in 'veins' the way other metals sometimes do, so they were hard to identify before modern technology was available. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Not unexpected in a volcanic and seismically active area; part and parcel related to the Japan Trench, where all sorts of geologically strange, bizarre and unexpected events transpire. Such as REE-laden asaphane (and juvenile) groundwaters circulate through the back-arc basinal muddy carbonate sediments, and through the magic of ReDox aqueous thermogeochemistry, some elements are concentrated whilst other become or remain mobile.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
