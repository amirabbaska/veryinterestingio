While it is not severe at all, my lower back does hurt if I don't sleep in a good mattress. Today I started wondering about sleeping on the floor and a quick google search showed me that it CAN be beneficial! So my question is. Why isn't this recommended by doctors more often? And do you have any experience regarding this topic? (as doctor who recommends it or individual who sleeps on the floor)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hard floor and a 'squishy' mattress are opposite extremes. The floor will fully support your body, but will not conform to your body shape. A mattress that is too soft will not support your body well, but will contour to your body well. Ideally, you will want a mattress that can still conform to your body but with sufficient support. This will ensure you can maintain the proper spinal support while sleeping without having too much or too little support. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody who knows what they're talking about recommends a firm mattress anymore. This is old school thinking. </p>
<p>You need something firm enough to hold you up and prevent you from &quot;hamocking&quot; into it, but soft enough to follow your natural form and relieve pressure. Semi firm is usually the best compromise, but a side sleeper should have something a bit softer to reduce the pressure on the shoulder and hips. </p>
<p>Sleeping on the floor is a terrible idea. Only way to make this work is to sleep flat on your back with your legs raised under some
Pillows.  But really you should just have a quality mattress that fits you properly. </p>
<p>Source: been selling mattresses for 10+ years and have thousands of happy clients. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who also has scoliosis, I cannot recommend the magic that is high quality memory foam enough. That said, I'd also take a gamble on that purple mattress, I have their pillow and it's pretty legit.  I've slept on select comfort (liked didn't love and not great for other bed activities), firm coil spring (horrible), cheap foam (decent), latex memory foam (great), wood floors  and tile floors (not a fan of either), and an ultra plush pocket coil mattress with 3 inch memory foam topper (cozy, a strong 2nd place) </p>
<p>Beds are very personal. Lay on it before you buy it or be able to return it on their dime is it ships in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've tried sleeping on the floor and on a low platform bed without a mattress just using a blanket or two underneath me. What I've found out is that I don't mind a hard surface because my body adjusts to it in a matter of days and from there on out, I'm comfortable while sleeping, even more so than on most of the beds I've tried over the years, but it can get cold. What's worse, you might not notice if you're cold straight away, you might just sleep through the night, which could have an effect on your health long-term. All in all, I'm definitely in favor of a hard sleeping surface, but just make sure you're warm enough.</p>
<p>You could try out a relatively cheap closed-foam camping mattress that has decent insulation (for example, a therm-a-rest ridge rest that has an R-value of around 3) and maybe even use it with a thinner sleeping bag (2-season). If you have a friend with a camping setup, ask to borrow it and try it out on your floor so that you don't have to spend any money before seeing if it works for you, and if it does, you can also go outdoors with it. You could also try sleeping without a pillow, which I found to be quite nice indoors and while camping. Finally, if you feel like you want to get up off the floor because of bugs or whatever, you can always add a simple DIY platform bed which shouldn't be too expensive to make. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why don't you try and see what's best for you? I often sleep on the floor and I always liked firm mattress, but some people like soft mattresses. I think it's very personal and you have to find out what works best. And if what is working now doesn't work in 10 years, then you change. My advice is that if you sleep on the floor you should try a thicker pillow. And try different pillows, if you don't have the one you need your back might hurt and you will think it's the mattress that is causing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
