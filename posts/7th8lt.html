		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nerves in your eye are only programmed to do one thing, and that is to see light and color. When you mash down your eye, you force the fluid in your eye to push on that nerve. It senses a stimulus and goes “oh! I must sense light and color!” So you process the pressure as sight instead of pressure</p>
<p>Edit: I just learned this in human physiology the other day, and I wrote it right as I was about to go to sleep. I would imagine the pattern is due to the pattern of your rods and cones. Those are what actually detect the light and transmit it to the nerves. I’m not sure if it will damage your eyes, but I’ve always been taught that it’s bad. I will go to my phys professor with some more of these questions tomorrow. Thanks everyone!</p>
<p>Edit 2: What are the patterns caused by? Various photoreceptors being activated, the ones that don’t activate haven’t reached threshold so are dark spots. </p>
<p>Can blind people see them? Depends on what kind of blindness they have. If it’s retinal in nature, they can’t. </p>
<p>Why can I see them sometimes when I just close my eyes? Mind me but I forgot the full answer to this, I had a long day (phone became an expensive paperweight). I do know that the photoreceptors are being activated but not sure why. </p>
<p>Is rubbing your eyes bad? Well it isn’t good is pretty much all I can remember on this one. Sorry guys, hectic day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Anyways, you are directly stimulating your eyes through physical pressure, as opposed to subjecting your eyes to visible light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you are squeezing your eyes, you're exciting the cells in the back of your eyes. These cells normally can only be excited by light, so your brain thinks it can &quot;see&quot; the squeeze.   </p>
<p>ELI26: I used to do this <strong>a</strong> <strong>lot</strong> when I was a kid. I noticed that after a few moments, the image would solidify into something resembling a green tunnel. The walls were comprised of undulating spiral grids, each square being centered with a small circle. The end of this tunnel was about one half the width of my vision, and was static snow. After several moments, I began seeing detailed images of things in the snow. Vagu faces. Buildings...   </p>
<p>What I want to know is what exactly was my brain doing when this effect began generating such complex imagery?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something called the Law of Specific Nerve Energies; the sensory modality a stimulus affects is determined by the pathway, not the actual stimuli.  Meaning, any stimulus to the rods and cones of the eyes such as pressure in the case of rubbing your eyes, will still produce visual sensations due to the tracts they take and the areas of the brain they wind up in.
