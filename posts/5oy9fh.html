		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one estimate. Ever notice how people turn down the volume of music in their car when they're driving to a new area or looking for a location? I've read that this can be described as an intentional reduction of stimulus used in order to improve focus. In fact, I turned down my music half way through writing that sentence. Perhaps in the same way when you're trying to think of something, you look off to the side to try and ignore whatever is in your visual field while you focus on searching for that info within your brain!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do this to reduce stimulus so we can focus better. When your eyes look left or right you are making your field of view smaller thus reducing the amount of stimulus you receive from your visual field. This allows for more processing power to be used in whatever mental task you're attempting like remembering something or calculating a math problem. We will also look in different directions depending on the type of mental task because many mental tasks majorly occupy either the right or left half of our brain and our visual fields are mostly split in the same way. </p>
<p>Example: for most people language is majorly located on the left half of your brain. If you're struggling to remember a word you might look to your left. This decreases the amount of light that can enter your right visual field. Everything in your right visual field is usually sent to your left brain (confusing I know) so by reducing the amount of stimulus received in the right visual field you send less signals to the left brain allowing for more processing power and better focus on remembering the word. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens often when you are talking to someone and are trying to remember some detail of the story you are telling. </p>
<p>The human brain has an amazing capacity of distinguishing between faces, but it comes at a cost of a lot of attention and focus required when looking at that person.The brain is almost captivated by their face. </p>
<p>Looking away breaks this captivation and makes it much easier to remember by focusing more on the story rather than the person's face that you're talking to. Turning the head would to the side would focus on the face even less helping you focus even better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When trying to recall honestly people look up and to the left. While trying to be deceitful people look up and to the right. It depends on which part of the brain we are trying to use. Analytical opposed to imaginative. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly another on top of what others have said is that we've seen animals tilt their head when confused because it helps them pick up sound better by changing the way they are hearing it, and we may mirror this to show our confusion through body language.  And/or we may have also had the ability to hear differently by tilting our heads and still do so out if instinct.  This is just a theory and it might get taken down because I'm not sure if guesses are allowed but whatevz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
